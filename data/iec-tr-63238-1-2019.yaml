  content: IEC TR 63238-1:2019 provides information and a template to create an interface
    control document (ICD) for any project which includes electronic assemblies, such
    as electronic circuit card assemblies (CCAs) or electronic devices, connected
    together. This document proposes electrical signal naming conventions when interfacing
    electronic assemblies, and an example containing seven signal naming conventions
    is included. This document supports original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) in
    the preparation and maintenance of their electronic assemblies interfaces and
    integration specifications to avoid misunderstanding of signals which can cause
    unnecessary design and/or integration errors, and testing complications.
