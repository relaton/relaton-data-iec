abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-74:2018+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular aluminium winding wire of class 180 with a sole coating based on polyesterimide
    resin, which can be modified providing it retains the chemical identity of the
    original resin and meets all specified wire requirements. NOTE A modified resin
    is a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives
    to enhance certain performance or application characteristics. The range of nominal
    conductor dimensions covered by this standard is:<br />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm
    - max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm - max. 5,60 mm.<br />\r\nWires
    of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this specification and apply to the complete
    range of conductors. The specified combinations of width and thickness as well
    as the specified width/thickness ratio are given in IEC 60317-0-9:2015.<br /><br
    />\r\nKeywords: insulated wires used for windings"
