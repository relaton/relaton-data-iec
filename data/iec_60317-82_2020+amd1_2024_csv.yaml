abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-82:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular copper winding wires of class 200 with a sole coating based on polyesterimide
    resin, which can be modified provided it retains the chemical identity of the
    original resin and meets all specified wire requirements.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒA modified
    resin is a resin that has undergone a chemical change or contains one or more
    additives to enhance certain performance or application characteristics.<br />\r\nThe
    range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this document is:<br />\r\nwidth:
    min. 2,0 mm max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\nthickness: min. 0,80 mm max. 5,60 mm.<br />\r\nWires
    of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this specification and apply to the complete
    range of conductors. The specified combinations of width and thickness as well
    as the specified width/thickness ratio are given in IEC 60317-0-2."
