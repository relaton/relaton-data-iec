abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the Supplementary Service (SS) Private User Mobility
    Registration (PUMR), which is applicable to various basic services supported by
    Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC
    11574.<br />\r\nSS-PUMR is a supplementary service that enables a PUM user to
    register at, or de-register from, any wired or wireless terminal within the PISN.
    The ability to register at different wired and wireless terminals in the PISN
    at different times enables the PUM user to maintain the provided services (including
    the ability to make and receive calls) at different access points.<br />\r\nSupplementary
    service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in CCITT Rec. I.130.<br />\r\nThis International Standard contains the stage 1
    and stage 2 specifications of SS-PUMR. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies
    the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause
    7) identifies the Functional Entities involved in the supplementary service and
    the information flows between them."
