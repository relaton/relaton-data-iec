abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Supplementary Service (SS)
    Private User Mobility Registration (PUMR), which is</p><p>applicable to various
    basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic
    services are specified in</p><p>ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>SS-PUMR is a supplementary
    service that enables a PUM user to register at, or de-register from, any wired
    or wireless</p><p>terminal within the PISN. The ability to register at different
    wired and wireless terminals in the PISN at different times enables</p><p>the
    PUM user to maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and
    receive calls) at different access points.</p><p>Supplementary service specifications
    are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT Rec.
    I.130.</p><p>This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of SS-PUMR. The stage 1 specification (clause 6)</p><p>specifies the general feature
    principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the
    Functional Entities</p><p>involved in the supplementary service and the information
    flows between them.</p>"
