abstract:
- content: "IEC 61811-1:2015+AMD1:2025 CSV applies to electromechanical telecom elementary
    relays. Relays according to this standard are provided for the operation in telecommunication
    applications. However, as electromechanical elementary relays, they are also suitable
    for particular industrial and other applications. This standard selects from IEC
    61810 series and other sources the appropriate methods of test to be used in detail
    specifications derived from this specification, and contains basic test schedules
    to be used in the preparation of such specifications in accordance with this standard.
    Detailed test schedules are contained in the detail specifications. This second
    edition of IEC 61811-1 cancels and replaces IEC 61811-1 published in 1999, IEC
    61811-10 published in 2002, IEC 61811-11 published in 2002, IEC 61811-50 published
    in 2002, IEC 61811-51 published in 2002, IEC 61811-52 published in 2002, IEC 61811-53
    published in 2002, IEC 61811-54 published in 2002, IEC 61811-55 published in 2002,
    and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous editions:<br />\r\na) to get one
    document for telecom relays;<br />\r\nb) update all relevant references."
