  content: "IEC 60684-3-214:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-214:2019
    gives the requirements for two types of heat-shrinkable, polyolefin sleeving,
    not flame retarded, thick and medium wall with a nominal shrink ratio of 3:1.
    This sleeving has been found suitable for use at temperatures of up to 100 °C.<br
    />\r\n- Type A: Medium wall - internal diameter up to 200 mm typically.<br />\r\n-
    Type B: Thick wall - internal diameter up to 200 mm typically.<br />\r\nThese
    sleevings are normally supplied in colour black. Since these types of sleeving
    cover a significantly large range of sizes and wall thicknesses, Annex A (Tables
    A.1 and A.2) of this document provides a guide to the range of sizes available.
    The actual size will be agreed between the user and supplier. Materials which
    conform to this specification meet established levels of performance. However,
    the selection of a material by a user for a specific application will be based
    on the actual requirements necessary for adequate performance in that application
    and not based on this specification alone. This fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical change with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- removal of colour fastness to light test,
    as this is covered by the test for carbon black content.<br />\r\nKeywords: Heat-shrinkable,
    polyolefin sleeving, not flame retarded, thick and medium wall"
