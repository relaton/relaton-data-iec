  content: "ISO/IEC 14763-2:2019 specifies requirements for the planning, installation
    and operation of telecommunications cabling and cabling infrastructures including
    cabling, pathways, spaces and telecommunications bonds (other than that specified
    in ISO/IEC 30129) in support of generic cabling standards and associated documents.
    The following aspects are addressed:<br />\r\na) specification of the installation;<br
    />\r\nb) quality assurance;<br />\r\nc) installation planning;<br />\r\nd) installation
    practice;<br />\r\ne) documentation;<br />\r\nf) administration;<br />\r\ng) testing;<br
    />\r\nh) inspection;<br />\r\ni) operation;<br />\r\nj) maintenance;<br />\r\nk)
    repair.<br />\r\nThe requirements and recommendations of Clauses 5 to 14 are premises-independent.
    Annexes C through G contain premises-specific amendments of and additions to these
    requirements and recommendations.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document describes
    the methodology for the assessment of spaces, pathways, pathway systems and cabling
    (either installed or planned) in support of remote powering objectives.<br />\r\nThis
    document excludes specific requirements applicable to other cabling systems (e.g.
    power supply cabling); however, it takes account of the effects other cabling
    systems may have on the installation of telecommunications cabling (and vice versa)
    and gives general advice.<br />\r\nThis document excludes those aspects of installation
    associated with the transmission of signals in free space between transmitters,
    receivers or their associated antenna systems (e.g. wireless, radio, microwave
    or satellite).<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to certain hazardous environments
    but does not exclude additional requirements which are applicable in particular
    circumstances (e.g. electricity supply and electrified railways).<br />\r\nSafety
    and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of
    this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information
    given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition: the inclusion of planning and installation
    practices to support remote powering over the telecommunications cabling infrastructure
    and the inclusion of planning and installation practices outside buildings."
