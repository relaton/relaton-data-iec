abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard can be used with benefits on all kinds
    of platform.</p><p>This International Standard's most immediate interest is for
    deploying portable applications</p><p>on small footprint devices. This International
    Standard provides dramatic savings of</p><p>dynamic memory and execution time
    without sacrificing any of the flexibility usually attached</p><p>to the use of
    non-pre-linked portable code.</p><p>This International Standard is especially
    important to provide a complete solution to execute</p><p>portable programs of
    which code size is bigger than the available dynamic memory.</p><p>This International
    Standard is also very important when fast reactivity of programs is</p><p>important.
    By avoiding the extra-processing related to loading into dynamic memory and</p><p>formatting
    classes at runtime, this International Standard provides a complete answer to
    the</p><p>problem of class-loading slow-down.</p><p>These benefits are particularly
    interesting for small devices supporting financial applications.</p><p>Such applications
    are often complex and relying on code of significant size, while the</p><p>pressure
    of the market often imposes to these devices to be of a low price and,</p><p>consequently,
    to be very small footprint platforms. In addition, to not impose unacceptable</p><p>delays
    to customers, it is important these applications do not waste time in loading
    classes</p><p>into dynamic memory when they are launched but, on the contrary,
    to be immediately</p><p>actively processing the transaction with no delay. When
    using smart cards, there are also</p><p>some loose real-time constraints that
    are better handled if it can be granted that no</p><p>temporary freezing of processing
    can occur due to class loading.</p><p>This International Standard can also be
    of great benefit for devices dealing with real-time</p><p>applications. In this
    case, avoiding the delays due to class loading can play an important</p><p>role
    to satisfy real-time constraints.</p>"
