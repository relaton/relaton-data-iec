- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard can
    be used with benefits on all kinds of platform.</p><p>This International Standard's
    most immediate interest is for deploying portable applications</p><p>on small
    footprint devices. This International Standard provides dramatic savings of</p><p>dynamic
    memory and execution time without sacrificing any of the flexibility usually attached</p><p>to
    the use of non-pre-linked portable code.</p><p>This International Standard is
    especially important to provide a complete solution to execute</p><p>portable
    programs of which code size is bigger than the available dynamic memory.</p><p>This
    International Standard is also very important when fast reactivity of programs
    is</p><p>important. By avoiding the extra-processing related to loading into dynamic
    memory and</p><p>formatting classes at runtime, this International Standard provides
    a complete answer to the</p><p>problem of class-loading slow-down.</p><p>These
    benefits are particularly interesting for small devices supporting financial applications.</p><p>Such
    applications are often complex and relying on code of significant size, while
    the</p><p>pressure of the market often imposes to these devices to be of a low
    price and,</p><p>consequently, to be very small footprint platforms. In addition,
    to not impose unacceptable</p><p>delays to customers, it is important these applications
    do not waste time in loading classes</p><p>into dynamic memory when they are launched
    but, on the contrary, to be immediately</p><p>actively processing the transaction
    with no delay. When using smart cards, there are also</p><p>some loose real-time
    constraints that are better handled if it can be granted that no</p><p>temporary
    freezing of processing can occur due to class loading.</p><p>This International
    Standard can also be of great benefit for devices dealing with real-time</p><p>applications.
    In this case, avoiding the delays due to class loading can play an important</p><p>role
    to satisfy real-time constraints.</p>
