abstract:
- content: 'ISO&#x2F;IEC 18012-2:2012(E) specifies a taxonomy and application interoperability
    model for the interoperability of products in the area of home systems. It also
    specifies an interoperability framework to allow products from multiple manufacturers
    to work together in order to provide a specific application. It describes an application
    process that exists above the OSI reference model (ISO&#x2F;IEC 7498-1) stack,
    with sufficient detail needed to establish interoperable applications in this
    domain. It is applicable to: single implementation home electronic system networks,
    connected devices and applications, multiple implementation home electronic system
    networks, connected devices and applications, automatically configured devices,
    manually configured devices and manually configured groups&#x2F;clusters of devices.'
