abstract:
- content: Aztec Code is a two-dimensional matrix symbology whose symbols are nominally
    square, made up of square modules on a square grid, with a square bullseye pattern
    at their centre. Aztec Code symbols can encode from small to large amounts of
    data with user-selected percentages of error correction.Manufacturers of bar code
    equipment and users of the technology require publicly available standard symbology
    specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and application
    standards. The publication of standardized symbology specifications is designed
    to achieve this.ISO/IEC 24778:2008 defines the requirements for the Aztec Code
    symbology. It specifies the Aztec Code symbology characteristics including data
    character encodation, rules for error control encoding, the graphical symbol structure,
    symbol dimensions and print quality requirements, a reference decoding algorithm,
    and user-selectable application parameters.
