abstract:
- content: "<p>Aztec Code is a two-dimensional matrix symbology whose symbols are
    nominally square, made up of square modules on a square grid, with a square bullseye
    pattern at their centre. Aztec Code symbols can encode from small to large amounts
    of data with user-selected percentages of error correction.</p><p>Manufacturers
    of bar code equipment and users of the technology require publicly available standard
    symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and
    application standards. The publication of standardized symbology specifications
    is designed to achieve this.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24778:2008 defines the requirements
    for the Aztec Code symbology. It specifies the Aztec Code symbology characteristics
    including data character encodation, rules for error control encoding, the graphical
    symbol structure, symbol dimensions and print quality requirements, a reference
    decoding algorithm, and user-selectable application parameters.</p>"
