abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-90-20:2025, which is a technical report, describes use cases
    of redundancy in systems.<br />\r\nThis document considers use cases of duplication
    of function and devices and covers redundancy of information flow at message level.
    Functional safety is out of scope of this document. To keep focus on details relevant
    for this document, some figures and drawings do not show electrical wiring, redundant
    coils, etc, where this is not important for the use case.<br />\r\nThis document
    is not a guideline on the design of redundancy systems; guidance on designing
    redundancy systems can be found in textbooks"
