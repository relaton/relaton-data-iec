  content: "IEC 60502-2:2014+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the construction, dimensions
    and test requirements of power cables with extruded solid insulation from 6 kV
    up to 30 kV for fixed installations such as distribution networks or industrial
    installations. When determining applications, it is recommended that the possible
    risk of radial water ingress is considered. Cable designs with barriers claimed
    to prevent longitudinal water penetration and an associated test are included
    in this part of IEC 60502. Cables for special installation and service conditions
    are not included, for example cables for overhead networks, the mining industry,
    nuclear power plants (in and around the containment area) nor for submarine use
    or shipboard application. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition,
    published in 2005, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) a simplified calculation procedure for the thickness of the lead sheath
    and the oversheath;<br />\r\nb) a new subclause for the determination of the cable
    conductor temperature;<br />\r\nc) a modified procedure for the routine voltage
    test;<br />\r\nd) a new subclause for a routine electrical test on oversheath;<br
    />\r\ne) modified requirements for the non-metal sheaths including semi-conductive
    layer;<br />\r\nf) modified tolerances for the bending test cylinder;<br />\r\ng)
    the inclusion of a 0,1 Hz test after installation.<br />\r\nIn addition, the modified
    structure of the IEC 60811 series has been adopted for this third edition."
