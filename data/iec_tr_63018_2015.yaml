abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63018:2015(E) specifies a guideline for improvement of signal loss
    by using noise suppression materials (hereafter referred to as NSMs) for FPCBs.
    This Technical Report also indicates a measuring method of signal loss variations
    of FPCBs using NSMs using network analyzer equipment. In addition, this method
    only measures the value of the signal loss variation by using NSMs for FPCBs.
    This report, however, neither determines nor indicates the structure or material
    of FPCBs.
