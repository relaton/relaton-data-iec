abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 60893-4:2014(E) serves as a technical report and presents tables
    of typical values for properties that are not studied and not given in Table 5
    of IEC 60893-3-2:2003/AMD1:2011, IEC 60893-3-3:2003/AMD1:2011, IEC 60893-3-4:2003/AMD1:2012,
    IEC 60893-3-5:2003/AMD1:2009, IEC 60893-3-6:2003/AMD1:2009, IEC 60893-3-7:2003/AMD1:2009.
    The purpose of these typical values is to give general guidance and should not
    be considered as specification requirements. The tables give typical values for
    the different types of industrial laminated sheets for electrical purposes described
    in the Part 3 sheets of IEC 60893. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition, published in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the typical values of modulus of elasticity
    in flexure and of comparative tracking index of EPGC (Epoxy Glass Cloth) types
    have been changed;<br />\r\n- the typical values of new material types introduced
    in IEC 60893-3-2:2003/AMD1:2011 have been included. Keywords: industrial rigid
    laminated sheets"
