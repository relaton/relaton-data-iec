    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60092-202:2016 is
    applicable to the main features of the electrical protective system to be applied
    to electrical installations for use in ships. This fifth edition cancels and replaces
    the fourth edition published in 1994 and Amendment 1:1996. This edition constitutes
    a full technical revision."
