abstract:
- content: "IEC 63185:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 63185:2025
    relates to a measurement method for complex permittivity of dielectric substrates
    at microwave and millimeter-wave frequencies. This method has been developed to
    evaluate the dielectric properties of low-loss materials used in microwave and
    millimeter-wave circuits and devices. It uses higher-order modes of a balanced-type
    circular disk resonator and provides broadband measurements of dielectric substrates
    by using one resonator, where the effect of excitation holes and that of fringing
    fields are taken into account accurately on the basis of the mode-matching analysis.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the upper limit of the applicable frequency range has been extended from
    110 GHz to 170 GHz;<br />\r\nb) circular disk resonators used for the measurements
    now include one with waveguide interfaces;<br />\r\nc) in calculating the complex
    permittivity from the measured resonant properties, the fringing fields are now
    accurately taken into account based on the mode-matching analysis."
