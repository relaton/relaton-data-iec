abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61282-16:2022 is a technical report on coherent optical receiver
    and transmitter technologies that are employed in fibre optic communication systems
    as well as in optical test and measurement equipment. This document describes
    the principle of operation and functional capabilities of coherent optical receivers
    as well as the operation of optical transmitters used to generate complex vector-modulated
    signals. It is intended to serve as a technical foundation for other IEC documents
    and standards related to coherent optical transmission techniques.
