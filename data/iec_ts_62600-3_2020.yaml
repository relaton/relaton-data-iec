abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-3:2020 describes the measurement of mechanical loads on hydrodynamic
    marine energy converters such as wave, tidal and other water current converters
    (including river current converters) for the purpose of load simulation model
    validation and certification. This document contains the requirements and recommendations
    for the measurement of mechanical loads for such activities as site selection,
    measurand selection, data acquisition, calibration, data verification, measurement
    load cases, capture matrix, post-processing, uncertainty determination and reporting.<br
    />\r\nThis document also defines the requirements for full-scale structural testing
    of subsystems or parts with a special focus on full-scale structural testing of
    marine energy converter rotor blades and for the interpretation and evaluation
    of achieved test results. This document focuses on aspects of testing related
    to an evaluation of the structural integrity of the blade. The purpose of the
    tests is to confirm to an acceptable level of probability that the whole installed
    production of a blade type fulfils the design assumptions."
