    <p>ISO/IEC 13868:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of name identification supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The name identification supplementary services are Calling Name Identification Presentation (SS-CNIP) and Connected Name Identification Presentation (SS-CONP).</p>
    <p>Calling Name Identification Presentation (CNIP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the called user and which provides the name of the calling user (calling party name) to the called user.</p>
    <p>Connected Name Identification Presentation (CONP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the calling user and which provides to the calling user the following:</p>
    <ul><li>the name of the user who answers the call (connected party name);</li><li>optionally the name of the alerting user (called party name);</li><li>optionally the name of the called user who cannot be reached (busy party name).</li></ul>
    <p>The supplementary service Calling/Connected Name Identification Restriction (CNIR) has no impact on the signalling at Q reference point.</p>
    <p>Provision of a user's name to the PISN is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 13868:2003.</p>
    <p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p>
    <p>Service specifications are produced in three stages according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13868:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13864.</p>
