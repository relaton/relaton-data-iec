abstract:
- content: "IEC 62106-1:2018 defines the basic layer of the Radio Data System (RDS)
    intended for application to VHF/FM sound broadcasts in the range 64,0 MHz to 108,0
    MHz, which can carry either stereophonic (pilot-tone system) or monophonic programmes
    (as stated in ITU‑R Recommendation BS.450-3 and ITU-R Recommendation BS.643-3).<br
    />\r\nIEC 62106-1:2018 together with IEC 62106-2, IEC 62106-3, IEC 62106-4, IEC
    62106-5 and IEC 62106-6, cancels and replaces IEC 62106:2015, and constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to IEC 62106:2015:<br />\r\n• Provision has been
    made to carry RDS on multiple data-streams (RDS2)."
