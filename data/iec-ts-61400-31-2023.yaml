  content: "IEC TS 61400-31:2023 establishes a guideline for the assessment of the
    risks which a wind turbine may pose to the general public.<br />\r\nThis document
    aims to facilitate a uniform scope and a uniform use of methods in wind turbine
    risk assessments. This document covers risk due to internal or external causes,
    such as technical failures, human errors, extreme wind conditions, turbine icing,
    lightning strikes, earthquakes, flooding, landslides or fire.This document covers
    only onshore wind turbines with a horizontal axis and a swept area greater than
    200 m2. Substations and other external structures are excluded.<br />\r\nThis
    document describes risks during operation of the wind turbine including maintenance,
    idling and standstill. It does not describe risks during construction, civil works,
    crane operations, assembly or decommissioning.<br />\r\nRisks according to this
    document are assessed by prescriptive and/or risk-based methods.<br />\r\nThis
    document covers risk reduction measures that might be necessary to reduce risk
    to a tolerable level."
