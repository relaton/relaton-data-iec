abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 60079-30-1:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 60079-30-1:2025
    specifies general and testing requirements for electrical resistance trace heaters
    for application in explosive atmospheres with the exclusion of those for Equipment
    Protection Levels (EPL) Ga, Da, Ma and Mb equipment. This document covers trace
    heaters that comprise either factory or field (worksite) assembled units, and
    which can be series trace heaters, parallel trace heaters, trace heater pads,
    or trace heater panels that have been assembled and/or terminated in accordance
    with the manufacturer's instructions.<br />\r\nThis document also includes requirements
    for termination assemblies and control methods used with trace heating systems.
    The explosive atmospheres referred to in this document are those defined in IEC
    60079-10-1 and IEC 60079-10-2.<br />\r\nAnnex F and Annex G outline the application
    of this document for those users applying the Division method of area classification<br
    />\r\nThis second edition of IEC/IEEE 60079-30-1 cancels and replaces the first
    edition of IEC/IEEE 60079-30-1 published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThe significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition can be found n the foreword of this publication."
