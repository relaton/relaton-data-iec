abstract:
- content: "IEC 60839-7-8:2019 specifies a protocol for point-to-point transmission
    of alarms and faults, as well as communications monitoring, between a supervised
    premises transceiver and a receiving centre transceiver using the Internet protocol
    (IP).<br />\r\nThe protocol is intended for use over any network that supports
    the transmission of IP data. These include Ethernet, xDSL, GPRS, WiFi, UMTS and
    WIMAX.<br />\r\nThe system performance characteristics for alarm transmission
    are specified in IEC 60839‑5‑1.<br />\r\nThe performance characteristics of the
    supervised premises equipment comply with the requirements of its associated alarm
    system standard and apply for transmission of all types of alarms including, but
    not limited to, fire, intrusion, access control and social alarms."
