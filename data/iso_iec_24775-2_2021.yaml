    and fault management - detecting failures through monitoring the state of storage
    components</li><li>General information about the object model</li><li>Names -
    how SMI-S uses names to allow applications to correlate across SMI-S and to other
    standards</li><li>Standard messages - how exceptions are presented to client applications</li><li>Service
