    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    24775-2:2021 Storage Management Technical Specification, Part 2 Common Architecture,
    1.8.0 Rev 4 defines the core architecture and protocols in SMI-S. The components
    of SMI-S architecture include:<br />\r\n- Transport - communicating management
    information between constituents of the management system<br />\r\n- Health and
    fault management - detecting failures through monitoring the state of storage
    components<br />\r\n- General information about the object model<br />\r\n- Names
    - how SMI-S uses names to allow applications to correlate across SMI-S and to
    other standards<br />\r\n- Standard messages - how exceptions are presented to
    client applications<br />\r\n- Service discovery - techniques clients use to discover
    SMI-S services<br />\r\n- Installation and upgrade - recommendations for implementations<br
    />\r\n- Compliance - requirement for compliance to the standard"
