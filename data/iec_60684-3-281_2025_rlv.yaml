abstract:
- content: "IEC 60684-3-281:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-281:2025
    gives the requirements for two types of heat-shrinkable, polyolefin sleeving,
    semiconductive, with a nominal shrink ratio of 3:1. This sleeving has been found
    suitable for use up to temperatures of 100 Â°C.<br />\r\n-Type A: Thin wall - Internal
    diameter up to 195,0 mm typically<br />\r\n-Type B: Medium wall - Internal diameter
    up to 120,0 mm typically<br />\r\nThis sleeving is normally supplied in the colour
    black.<br />\r\nSince these types of sleevings cover a significantly large range
    of sizes and wall thicknesses, Annex A provides guidance on the range of sizes
    available. The actual size will be agreed between the user and the supplier. Materials
    which conform to this specification meet established levels of performance. However,
    the selection of a material by a user for a specific application will be based
    on the actual requirements necessary for adequate performance in that application
    and not based on this specification alone. This sleeving is designed to be used
    in MV cable accessories and as such electrical performance will be proven as part
    of the assembly. Examples of this are described in HD 629 and IEC 60502 (all parts).<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) change in volume resistivity requirement to a maximum;<br />\r\nb) change
    in method to measure resistivity."
