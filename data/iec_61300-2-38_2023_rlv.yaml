abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-2-38:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-38:2023
    presents two methods for testing the sealing performance of a fibre optic sealed
    closure and hardened connector using air pressure. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2006. It constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of sealed hardened connectors;<br
    />\r\nb) recommended test severities from IEC 61753-1;<br />\r\nc) test configurations
    for hardened connectors and adaptors."
