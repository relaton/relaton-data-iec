abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61340-6-2:2023 applies to the interior design of public places,
    retail and office areas such as, but not limited to staircases, offices, meeting
    rooms, auditoriums, airports, train stations, shopping centres, restaurants and
    theatres. This document includes guidelines for architects, interior designers
    and facility managers.<br />\r\nHazards, nuisances and other problems associated
    with electrostatic phenomena and the principles of their control are outlined.
    This document includes requirements and recommendations for materials, and products
    used to control static electricity.<br />\r\nThe handling of electrostatic sensitive
    components is described in IEC 61340-5-1 and the avoidance of hazards due to static
    electricity in explosive atmospheres is presented in IEC TS 60079-32-1. The requirements
    for electrostatic control in healthcare facilities are specified in IEC 61340-6-1.
    The guidance in this document is not intended to replace or supersede the requirements
    of the aforementioned standards and technical specification, but can be used in
    association with them to establish appropriate electrostatic control measures.<br
    />\r\nThese guidelines do not replace or supersede any requirements for personnel
    safety specified in other standards or codes of practice."
