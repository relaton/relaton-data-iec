  content: "IEC 60335-2-3:2022+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of electric dry
    irons and steam irons, including those with a separate water reservoir or boiler
    having a capacity not exceeding 5 l, for household and similar purposes, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied
    appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use, but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances, which are
    encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does
    not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n–
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national authorities responsible
    for the safety of pressure vessels. and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n– ironers (IEC 60335-2-44);<br />\r\n– ironing boards;<br
    />\r\n– appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis
    seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2012 and Amendment
    1:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion or conversion of
    some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 21.101);<br />\r\nc) addition of
    external accessible surface temperature limits (3.6.103, 11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\nd)
    clarification of surfaces likely to be contacted when gripping a handle (22.13);<br
    />\r\ne) clarification of the applicability of 30.2.2 and 30.2.3 (30.2, 30.2.3).<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
