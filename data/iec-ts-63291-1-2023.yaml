  content: "IEC TS 63291-1:2023 contains guidelines on planning, specification, and
    execution of multi-vendor HVDC grid systems also referred to as HVDC grids. The
    terms \"HVDC grid systems\" or \"HVDC grids\" are used in this document to describe
    HVDC systems for power transmission having more than two HVDC stations connected
    to a common DC circuit. The DC circuit can be of radial or meshed topology or
    a combination thereof. In this document, the term \"HVDC grids\" is used.<br />\r\nWhile
    this document focuses on requirements specific for HVDC grids, some requirements
    are considered applicable to all HVDC systems in general, i.e., including point‑to‑point
    HVDC systems. Existing IEC (e.g. IEC TR 63363-1 [1]), Cigre or other relevant
    documents have been used for reference as far as possible.<br />\r\nCorresponding
    to electric power transmission applications, this document is applicable to high
    voltage systems, i.e. those having typically nominal DC voltages higher than 50
    kV with respect to earth are considered in this document.<br />\r\nNOTE While
    the physical principles of DC networks are basically voltage independent, the
    technical options for designing equipment get much wider with lower DC voltage
    levels, e.g. in case of converters or switchgear.<br />\r\nThis document covers
    technical aspects of:<br />\r\n- coordination of HVDC grid and AC systems,<br
    />\r\n- HVDC grid characteristics,<br />\r\n- HVDC grid control,<br />\r\n- HVDC
    grid protection,<br />\r\n- AC/DC converter stations,<br />\r\n- HVDC grid installations,
    including DC switching stations and HVDC transmission lines,<br />\r\n- studies
    and associated models,<br />\r\n- testing.<br />\r\nBeyond the scope of this document,
    the following content is proposed for future work:<br />\r\nDC/DC converter stations."
