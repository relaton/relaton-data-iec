    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62453-2:2022
    explains the common principles of the field device tool concept. These principles
    can be used in various industrial applications such as engineering systems, configuration
    programs and monitoring and diagnostic applications. This document specifies the
    general objects, general object behavior and general object interactions that
    provide the base of FDT."
