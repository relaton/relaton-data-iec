abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62541-2:2016(E) is a Technical Report and describes the OPC unified
    architecture (OPC UA) security model. It describes the security threats of the
    physical, hardware, and software environments in which OPC UA is expected to run.
    It describes how OPC UA relies upon other standards for security. It provides
    definition of common security terms that are used in this and other parts of the
    OPC UA specification. It gives an overview of the security features that are specified
    in other parts of the OPC UA specification. It references services, mappings,
    and Profiles that are specified normatively in other parts of this multi-part
    specification. It provides suggestions or best practice guidelines on implementing
    security. Any seeming ambiguity between this part of IEC 62541 and one of the
    normative parts of IEC 62541 does not remove or reduce the requirement specified
    in the normative part. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    of IEC TR 62541-2, published in 2010. This second edition includes no technical
    changes with respect to the first edition but a number of clarifications and additional
    text for completeness.
