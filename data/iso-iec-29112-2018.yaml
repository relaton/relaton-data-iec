    <p>This document defines methods for the objective measurement of the print quality characteristics that contribute to the perceived resolution of reflection mode monochrome printed pages produced by digital electro-photographic printers. The measurement methods of this document are derived from several existing techniques for the assessment of an imaging system's resolution characteristics. Each of these measurement methods is intended for the engineering evaluation of a printing system's perceived resolution and is not intended to be used for purposes of advertising claims.</p>
    <p>The methods of this document are applicable only to monochrome prints produced in reflection mode by electro-photographic printing technology. This document is intended for monochrome printers utilizing PostScript®[1] interpreters capable of accepting PostScript and encapsulated PostScript (EPS) jobs.</p>
