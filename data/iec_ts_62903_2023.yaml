abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TS 62903:2023 is available as IEC TS 62903:2023 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC TS 62903:2023:<br
    />\r\na ) establishes the free-field convergent spherical wave self-reciprocity
    method for ultrasonic transducer calibration,<br />\r\nb) establishes the measurement
    conditions and experimental procedure required to determine the transducer's electroacoustic
    parameters and acoustic output power using the self-reciprocity method,<br />\r\nc)
    establishes the criteria for checking the reciprocity of these transducers and
    the linear range of the focused field, and<br />\r\nd) provides guiding information
    for the assessment of the overall measurement uncertainties for radiation conductance.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to:<br />\r\n1) circular spherically curved
    concave focusing transducers without a centric hole working in the linear amplitude
    range,<br />\r\n2) measurements in the frequency range 0,5 MHz to 15 MHz, and<br
    />\r\n3) acoustic pressure amplitudes in the focused field within the linear amplitude
    range.<br />\r\nCharacterization and sensitivity calibration of hydrophones using
    the reciprocity method are not addressed in this document but covered in IEC 62127-2
    and IEC 60565-1.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62903:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Several quantities are recognized as complex-valued quantities
    in the definitions and in the main text.<br />\r\nb) Annex I was added to provide
    typical measurement ranges and to provide example calibration results."
