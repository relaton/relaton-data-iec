abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2011 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-3, but does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.<br /><br />\r\nThe test
    methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions
    which are implemented, be verified. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be
    supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are
    not available in the general case.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2011 includes
    the following interrogator and tag conformance parameters:<br />\r\n\tmode-specific
    conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;<br />\r\n\tparameters
    that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.<br /><br
    /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2011 does not include the following:<br
    />\r\n\tparameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;<br
    />\r\n\thigh-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified
    in ISO/IEC 15962).<br /><br /><br />"
