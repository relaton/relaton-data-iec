abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2011 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-3, but does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The test methods
    require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are
    implemented, be verified. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented
    by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available
    in the general case.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2011 includes the following interrogator
    and tag conformance parameters:</p><ul><li>mode-specific conformance parameters
    including nominal values and tolerances;</li><li>parameters that apply directly
    affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2011
    does not include the following:</p><ul><li>parameters that are already included
    in regulatory test requirements;</li><li>high-level data encoding conformance
    test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).</li></ul>"
