  content: "The development and delivery of smart cities involves many different systems,
    types of data, and sets of information. This complexity, and the dynamic interaction
    between the large numbers of stakeholders and city systems, makes planning and
    managing cities a great challenge. Without a tangible operational model to combine
    cross-sector data and information, the holistic, cross-boundary planning of cities,
    districts and neighbourhoods remains constrained. Therefore, new and effective
    tools are needed to enable the delivery of better city services and to make the
    urban environment more liveable, inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nCity information modelling (CIM) and urban digital twins (UDT)
    are two emerging technologies for smart cities that aim to provide such tools.
    Both offer solutions for data processing, urban analysis, design, simulation and
    modelling. They connect all involved stakeholders and actors to collaboratively
    deliver the vision of a smart city: a sustainable, inclusive, healthy, prosperous
    and participative city. They provide solutions for smart cities based on open
    standards and a multiscale and multitemporal database that integrates a wide variety
    of data sources presenting the full range of smart urban features, systems and
    processes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis report is an output of the international conference,
    <em>Conversation between City Information Modelling and Urban Digital Twins: 2021
    Virtual Forum</em>, organized by <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:186:::::FSP_ORG_ID:13073\">IEC
