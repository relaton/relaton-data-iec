abstract:
- content: "IEC 62047-27:2017(E) specifies a method for assessing the bond strength
    of glass frit bonded structures using micro-chevron-tests (MCT). It describes
    suitable sample geometry and provides guidance for the design of deviating sample
    geometries.<br />\r\nThe micro-chevron-test is an experimental method to determine
    the fracture toughness<em>K</em>IC of brittle materials or bond interfaces using
    specifically designed test chips (micro-chevron-samples) under defined load conditions
    (crack opening mode I). Owing to its high precision and low variance, it is suitable
    for analysing the influence of different process parameters on bond strength as
    well as for quality assurance."
