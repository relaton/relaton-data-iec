  content: IEC 62715-6-2:2017(E) specifies testing methods for evaluating the environmental
    endurance of flexible display panels and modules for use, storage and transport
    under assumed usage environment. This part of IEC 62715 is applicable to flexible
    display panels and modules such as liquid crystal display devices (LCDs), electric
    paper display devices (EPDs), and organic light emitting diode display devices
    (OLEDs). This part of IEC 62715 will also be suitable for flexible panel or module
    with mechanical operation.
