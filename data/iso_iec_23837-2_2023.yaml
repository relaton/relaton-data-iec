abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23837-2:2023 This document specifies test and evaluation methods
    for the security evaluation of quantum key distribution (QKD). It also describes
    evaluation activities that constitute the test and evaluation methods for the
    security functional requirements on the implementation of QKD protocols, the quantum
    optical components and conventional network components in QKD modules. Moreover,
    supplementary evaluation activities for security assurance requirements are provided
    to support the security evaluation of QKD with appropriate assurance levels.
