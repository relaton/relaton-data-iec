abstract:
- content: "IEC 60947-4-3:2020(E) applies to semiconductor controllers and semiconductor
    contactors for non-motor load intended to be connected to circuits, the rated
    voltage of which does not exceed 1 000 V AC.<br />\r\nIt covers their use:<br
    />\r\n– for operations of changing the state of AC electric circuits between the
    ON-state and the OFF-state;<br />\r\n– with or without bypass switching devices;<br
    />\r\n– as controller, for reducing the amplitude of the RMS AC voltage.<br />\r\nThis
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2014. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    scope exclusions;<br />\r\nb) editorial correction of notes and hanging paragraphs;<br
    />\r\nc) safety aspects related to:<br />\r\n- general aspects;<br />\r\n- limited
    energy circuits;<br />\r\n- electronic circuits;<br />\r\nd) mention of dedicated
    wiring accessories;<br />\r\ne) power consumption measurement;<br />\r\nf) alignment
    to IEC 60947-1:2020;<br />\r\ng) alignment with IEC 60947-4-2 when appropriate."
