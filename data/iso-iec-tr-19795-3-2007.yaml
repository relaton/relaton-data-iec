    <p>In biometric performance testing and reporting, careful consideration needs to be given to the characteristic differences of each modality (fingerprint, face, iris, etc.). These differences naturally require variations within the general methodology defined in ISO/IEC 19795-1.  </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 19795-3:2007 describes the methodologies relating to these modality-dependent variations. It presents and defines methods for determining, given a specific biometric modality, how to develop a technical performance test.</p>
