    This part of IEC 62258 has been developed to facilitate the production, supply and use of semiconductor die products, including
    - wafers
    - singulated bare die
    - die and wafers with attached connection structures
    - minimally or partially encapsulated die and wafers

    This standard defines the minimum requirements for the data which are needed to describe such die products and is intended as an aid in the design of and procurement of assemblies incorporating die products. It covers the requirements for data, including product identity, product data, die mechanical information, test, quality, assembly and reliability information, handling, shipping and storage information.
