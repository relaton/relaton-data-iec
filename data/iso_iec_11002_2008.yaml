    provides management interfaces as defined in ISO/IEC 14776-453 (Information technology
    - Small computer system interface (SCSI) - Part 453: Primary commands-3 (SPC-3))
    and  common vendor-specific extensions to the standard capabilities. ISO/IEC 11002
    relates to SCSI multipathing features and excludes multipathing between interconnect
    devices (such as Fibre Channel switches) and transport specific multipathing (such
    as iSCSI multiple connections per session).'
