  content: "IEC 61800-5-2:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61800-5-2:2016 specifies
    requirements and makes recommendations for the design and development, integration
    and validation of safety related power drive systems (PDS(SR)) in terms of their
    functional safety considerations. It applies to adjustable speed electrical power
    drive systems covered by the other parts of the IEC 61800 series of standards
    as referred in IEC 61800-2. IEC 61800-5-2, which is a product standard, sets out
    safety-related considerations of PDS(SR)s in terms of the framework of IEC 61508,
    and introduces requirements for PDS(SR)s as subsystems of a safety-related system.
    It is intended to facilitate the realisation of the electrical/electronic/programmable
    electronic (E/E/PE) parts of a PDS(SR) in relation to the safety performance of
    safety sub-function(s) of a PDS. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) rational added
    in the scope why low demand mode is not covered by this standard,<br />\r\nb)
    definition added for: \"category\" and \"safety function\",<br />\r\nc) \"Other
    sub-functions\" sorted into \"Monitoring sub-functions\" and \"Output functions\",<br
    />\r\nd) deleted \"proof test\" throughout the document because for PDS(SR) a
    proof test is not applicable,<br />\r\ne) replaced the term \"safety function\"
    by \"safety sub-function\" throughout the document,<br />\r\nf) Updated references
    to IEC 61508 series Ed.2010,<br />\r\ng) Added the principle rules of ISO 13849-1
    and reference to tables of ISO 13849-2,<br />\r\nh) 6.1.6 Text replaced by Table
    2,<br />\r\ni) 6.1.7 Integrated circuits with on-chip redundancy matched to changed
    requirement in IEC 61508-2: 2010, Annex E,<br />\r\nj) 6.2.8 Design requirements
    for thermal immunity of a PDS(SR),<br />\r\nk) 6.2.9 Design requirements for mechanical
    immunity of a PDS(SR),<br />\r\nl) 6.1.6 SIL for multiple safety sub-functions
    within one PDS(SR),<br />\r\nm) 6.1.7 Integrated circuits with on-chip redundancy,<br
    />\r\nn) 6.2.1 Basic and well-tried safety principles,<br />\r\no) 6.2.2.1.4 Diagnostic
    test interval when the hardware fault tolerance is greater than zero,<br />\r\np)
    6.2.5.2.7 PDS(SR) parameterization,<br />\r\nq) 9 Test requirements,<br />\r\nr)
    9.3 Electromagnetic (EM) immunity testing,<br />\r\ns) 9.4 Thermal immunity testing,<br
    />\r\nt) 9.5 Mechanical immunity testing,<br />\r\nu) Annex A Sequential task
    table,<br />\r\nv) Annex D, D.3.16, Motion and position feedback sensors updated,<br
    />\r\nw) Annex E Electromagnetic immunity (EM) requirement for PDS(SR),<br />\r\nx)
    Annex F Estimation of PFDavg value for low demand with given PFH value."
