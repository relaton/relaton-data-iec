abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines the mapping functions in exchanges
    of Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs)</p><p>required for the utilization
    of scenarios in which 64 kbit/s circuit mode connections are sub-multiplexed into
    4 x 16 kbit/s</p><p>channels for carrying inter-PINX signalling and user information.</p><p>NOTE
    1 - This International Standard has been prepared to meet the specific needs of
    an application for a particular user organisation.</p><p>However, it may also
    be applicable elsewhere. The requirements contained in this International Standard
    will be incorporated in any future</p><p>standard specifying a more generic approach
    to bearer conditioning.</p><p>In order to connect a Private Integrated Services
    Network Exchange (PINX) to another PINX, mapping functions are required</p><p>to
    adapt the specific interfaces at the C reference point to the application at the
    Q reference point. As such, mapping functions</p><p>provide for physical adaptation
    to the interface at the C reference point. Mapping functions also provide for
    the mapping of</p><p>user channels and signalling information at the Q reference
    point to the appropriate channels or timeslots at the C reference</p><p>point.</p><p>The
    C and Q reference points are defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>The type of interface
    at the C reference point covered by this International Standard is the 64 kbit/s
    Unrestricted Digital Leased</p><p>Line (D64U) Terminal Equipment Interface, in
    accordance with ITU-T Rec. G.703.</p><p>At the Q reference point the mapping provides
    a 16 kbit/s service for user channels to support the transfer of unrestricted</p><p>digital
    information and to support the transfer of speech, and a packet mode service for
    the signalling channel. The applied</p><p>mapping is a static mapping, i.e. there
    is a fixed relationship between user and signalling channels at the Q reference
    point and</p><p>the interface at the C reference point.</p><p>Management functions
    relating to failure management are outside the scope of this International Standard.</p><p>This
    International Standard is applicable to PINXs that can be interconnected to form
    a Private Integrated Services Network</p><p>(PISN) and that support signalling
    protocols at the Q reference point.</p>"
