abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard defines the mapping functions in exchanges of Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISNs) required for the utilization of scenarios in which 64
    kbit/s circuit mode connections are sub-multiplexed into 4 x 16 kbit/s channels
    for carrying inter-PINX signalling and user information.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 - This
    International Standard has been prepared to meet the specific needs of an application
    for a particular user organisation.<br />\r\nHowever, it may also be applicable
    elsewhere. The requirements contained in this International Standard will be incorporated
    in any future standard specifying a more generic approach to bearer conditioning.<br
    />\r\nIn order to connect a Private Integrated Services Network Exchange (PINX)
    to another PINX, mapping functions are required to adapt the specific interfaces
    at the C reference point to the application at the Q reference point. As such,
    mapping functions provide for physical adaptation to the interface at the C reference
    point. Mapping functions also provide for the mapping of user channels and signalling
    information at the Q reference point to the appropriate channels or timeslots
    at the C reference point.<br />\r\nThe C and Q reference points are defined in
    ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nThe type of interface at the C reference point covered
    by this International Standard is the 64 kbit/s Unrestricted Digital Leased Line
    (D64U) Terminal Equipment Interface, in accordance with ITU-T Rec. G.703.<br />\r\nAt
    the Q reference point the mapping provides a 16 kbit/s service for user channels
    to support the transfer of unrestricted digital information and to support the
    transfer of speech, and a packet mode service for the signalling channel. The
    applied mapping is a static mapping, i.e. there is a fixed relationship between
    user and signalling channels at the Q reference point and the interface at the
    C reference point.<br />\r\nManagement functions relating to failure management
    are outside the scope of this International Standard.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard is applicable to PINXs that can be interconnected to form a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN) and that support signalling protocols at the Q reference
    point."
