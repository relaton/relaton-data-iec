abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-10:2016(E) describes cables primarily intended for work area
    cords as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and in ISO/IEC TR 11801-9901 which is planned
    to be included in the next edition of ISO/IEC 11801-1. It covers overall screened
    cables with screened (X/FTP) or unscreened (X/UTP) pairs, where X stands for F,
    S or SF, as well as pair-screened cables without overall screen (U/FTP). The transmission
    characteristics of these cables are specified up to a frequency of 2 000 MHz and
    at a temperature of 20 Â°C. Two categories of cables are recognised:<br />\r\n-
    Category 8.1 for use in Class I according to ISO/IEC TR 11801-9901;<br />\r\n-
    Category 8.2 for use in Class II according to ISO/IEC TR 11801-9901."
