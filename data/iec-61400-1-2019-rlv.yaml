  content: "IEC 61400-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61400-1:2019 specifies
    essential design requirements to ensure the structural integrity of wind turbines.
    Its purpose is to provide an appropriate level of protection against damage from
    all hazards during the planned lifetime. This document is concerned with all subsystems
    of wind turbines such as control and protection functions, internal electrical
    systems, mechanical systems and support structures. This document applies to wind
    turbines of all sizes. For small wind turbines, IEC 61400-2 can be applied. IEC
    61400-3-1 provides additional requirements to offshore wind turbine installations.
    This document is intended to be used together with the appropriate IEC and ISO
    standards mentioned in Clause 2. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) general update
    and clarification of references and requirements;<br />\r\nb) extension of wind
    turbine classes to allow for tropical cyclones and high turbulence;<br />\r\nc)
    Weibull distribution of turbulence standard deviation for normal turbulence model
    (NTM);<br />\r\nd) updated design load cases (DLCs), in particular DLC 2.1 and
    2.2;<br />\r\ne) revision of partial safety factor specifications<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum 1 (2019-09) and Interpretation sheet 1 (2025-02) have
    been included in this copy.</p>"
