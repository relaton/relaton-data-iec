  content: "IEC TR 62271-307:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR
    62271-307:2024 refers to prefabricated metal-enclosed and solid-insulation enclosed
    (both hereinafter called enclosed) switchgear and controlgear assemblies for alternating
    current of rated voltages above 1 kV and up to and including 52 kV as specified
    in IEC 62271‑200 and IEC 62271‑201, and to other equipment included in the same
    enclosure with any possible mutual influence. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Structure of document updated.<br
    />\r\nb) Updated references to IEC 62271-200:2021 and IEC 62271-1:2017.<br />\r\nc)
    Addition of criteria for the extension of validity of type tests from functional
    unit(s) with a different insulating gas to the functional unit to be validated.<br
    />\r\nd) Figure 5 for the validation of a design modification was added.<br />\r\ne)
    Clause B.7 for the extension of validity of type test for a GIS with insulation
    gas A to insulation gas B was added."
