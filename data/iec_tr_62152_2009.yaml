abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62152:2009(E) lays the foundation for agreement on the fundamental
    terms and definitions to be used world wide in describing the transmission properties
    of a two-port or quadripole end and builds a bridge between the classical quadripole
    theory and the scattering matrix presentation which is based on incident and reflecting
    square root of power waves at the input and output of a two-port. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the previous one and introduces some technical improvements.
    Important terms and definitions have been added. Some of the terms are better
    described in the German language and therefore many countries have originally
    taken terms and definitions from German and translated them into their own language.
