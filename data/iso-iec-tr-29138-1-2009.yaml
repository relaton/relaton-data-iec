    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29138-1:2009 identifies a collection of user needs of people with disabilities for standards developers to take into consideration when developing or revising their standards. These user needs are also useful for developers of information technology products and services and for accessibility advocates to consider.</p>
    <p>In addition to identifying user needs, ISO/IEC TR 29138-1:2009 identifies problems that people with disabilities experience with information technologies that lead to these user needs and identifies the relationship of these user needs with the accessibility factors for standards developers to consider found in ISO/IEC Guide 71:<i> Guidelines to address the needs of older persons and people with disabilities</i> when developing standards.</p>
