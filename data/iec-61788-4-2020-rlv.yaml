  content: "IEC 61788-4:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61788-4:2020 specifies
    a test method for the determination of the residual resistance ratio (RRR) of
    Nb-Ti and Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn composite superconductors with Cu, Cu-Ni, Cu/Cu-Ni
    and Al matrix in a strain-free condition and zero external magnetic field. This
    method is intended for use with superconductor specimens that have a monolithic
    structure with rectangular or round cross-section, RRR value less than 350, and
    cross-sectional area less than 3 mm<sup>2</sup>. In the case of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn,
    the specimens have received a reaction heat-treatment. This fifth edition cancels
    and replaces the fourth edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) change in the suitable
    distance of voltage taps on the specimen for reliable measurement,<br />\r\nb)
    new report on the result of the round robin test of the residual resistance ratio
    of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn superconductors that proves the validity of the measurement
    method in this standard,<br />\r\nc) revision of the confusing definitions of
    the copper ratio and copper fraction.</p>"
