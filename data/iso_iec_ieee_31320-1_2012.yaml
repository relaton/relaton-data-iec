abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 31320-1:2012 identifies the basic components of Integration
    Definition 0 (IDEF0) syntax (the drawn, visual elements of the language and how
    they may be used together) and IDEF0 semantics (what it means when the visual
    elements are used together in specific, allowable ways), specifies the rules that
    govern the use of these modelling components, and describes the types of diagrams
    used in an IDEF0 model. ISO/IEC/IEEE 31320-1:2012 identifies and discusses the
    model pages with which each diagram in an IDEF0 model is associated and discusses
    specific features found in an IDEF0 diagram. It describes IDEF0 reference expressions
    and IDEF0 diagram feature references. It also presents an abstract formalization
    of the IDEF0 language.
