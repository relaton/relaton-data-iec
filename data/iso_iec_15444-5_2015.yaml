abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15444-5:2015 defines a set of lossless and lossy compression
    methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, greyscale or colour digital still
    images. This Recommendation | International Standard provides three independently
    created software reference implementations of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1,
    in order to assist implementers of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 in testing
    and understanding its content. The packages are JASPER, JJ2000 and OPENJPEG.</p><p>The
    reference software packages are informative only. This Recommendation | International
    Standard does not define any additional part of the JPEG 2000 image coding system.</p><p>Each
    version of the reference software contains source code, which may be compiled
    to provide the following functionality:</p><p>- transcoding from selected, widely
    available image formats into a JPEG 2000 codestream;</p><p>- transcoding from
    selected, widely available image formats into the JP2 file format;</p><p>- selection
    of a wide range of JPEG 2000 encoding options (as documented in each reference
    software);</p><p>- decoding from a JPEG 2000 codestream to a range of selected
    widely available image formats;</p><p>- Processing of a JP2 file to extract a
    JPEG 2000 codestream for decoding and conversion to a range of selected widely
    available image formats.</p><p>- The ability to extract metadata from a JP2 file,
    including the contents of the Image Header box and the colour space.</p><p>- The
    decoding of JP2 files that use the Three-Component Matrix-Based form of the Restricted
    ICC method for the specification of colour space and the conversion of the decoded
    image data to the sRGB colour space for display, including limited upsampling
    of all decoded components to the same resolution.</p><p>- The decoding of JP2
    files that use the Monochrome form of the Restricted ICC method for the specification
    of colour space and the conversion of the decoded image data to the sRGB based
    greyscale space as defined within the JP2 file format.</p><p>- The decoding of
    JP2 files that use the sYCC colour space and the conversion of the decoded image
    data to the sRGB colour space for display, including upsampling of all decoded
    components to the same resolution.</p><p>- some additional tools to help with
    evaluation and testing.</p><p>The reference software is intended for use as a
    testing and validation tool for other implementations of JPEG 2000, and to help
    in the understanding of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1. Although components
    of the reference software may find application in software intended for product
    development, this was not an objective of the development of this software, and
    prospective implementers are cautioned against making any estimations of performance
    or resource usage based on the reference software.</p>"
