abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 24748-1:2016 provides guidelines for the life cycle management
    of systems and software, complementing the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 and ISO/IEC 12207. This Technical Specification:<br />\r\n- addresses systems
    concepts and life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes, process application,
    key points of view, adaptation and use in various domains and by various disciplines;<br
    />\r\n- establishes a common framework for describing life cycles, including their
    individual stages, for the management of projects to provide, or acquire either
    products or services;<br />\r\n- defines the concept and terminology of a life
    cycle;<br />\r\n- supports the use of the life cycle processes within an organization
    or a project. Organizations and projects can use these life cycle concepts when
    acquiring and supplying either products or services;<br />\r\n- provides guidance
    on adapting a life cycle model and the content associated with a life cycle or
    a part of a life cycle;<br />\r\n- describes the relationship between life cycles
    and their use in applying the processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (systems aspects)
    and ISO/IEC 12207 (software aspects);<br />\r\n- shows the relationships of life
    cycle concepts to the hardware, human, services, process, procedure, facility
    and naturally occurring entity aspects of projects; and<br />\r\n- describes how
    its concepts relate to detailed process standards, for example, in the areas of
    measurement, project management and risk management."
