abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63099-3:2022 provides technical information about the methods for
    an antenna near-field measurement in the terahertz-wave band. The methods are
    applied to the frequency bands above 100 GHz, which has potential for use in terahertz
    wireless communication. The methods consist in measuring the amplitude and phase
    distributions of the electromagnetic field at the near-field range of on-chip
    antenna devices which integrate RF and IF components. This document also gives
    examples of the far-field pattern calculated from the measured near-field pattern.
