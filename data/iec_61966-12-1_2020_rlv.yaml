abstract:
- content: "IEC 61966-12-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61966-12-1:2020
    defines the colour gamut metadata scheme for video systems and similar applications.
    The metadata can be associated with wide-gamut video colour content or to a piece
    of equipment to display the content. When associated with content, the colour
    gamut metadata defines the gamut for which the content was created. It can be
    used by the display for controlled colour reproduction even if the displayâ€™s colour
    gamut is different from that of the content. When associated with a display, the
    colour gamut metadata defines the display colour gamut. It can be used during
    content creation to enable improved colour reproduction. The colour gamut metadata
    can cover associated colour encoding information, which includes all information
    required for a controlled colour reproduction, when such information is not provided
    by the colour encoding specification. The colour gamut metadata scheme provides
    scalable solutions. For example, more flexible solutions will be used for the
    professional use, while much simpler solutions will be used for consumer use with
    easier product implementation. This part of IEC 61966 only defines the colour
    gamut metadata scheme. Vendor-specific solutions for creation and end-use of this
    metadata are allowed. IEC 61966-12-1:2020 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) ITU-R BT.2020 colour spaces added in Clause 6;<br />\r\nb)
    ITU-R BT.2100 colour spaces added in Clause 6."
