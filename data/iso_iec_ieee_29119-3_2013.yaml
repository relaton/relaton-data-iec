abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards
    is to define an internationally-agreed set of standards for software testing that
    can be used by any organization when performing any form of software testing.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119-3:2013 includes templates and examples of test documentation. The templates
    are arranged within clauses reflecting the overall test process description structure
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2, i.e. by the test process in which they are being produced.
    Annex A contains outlines of the contents of each document. Annex B contains mappings
    of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2. Annex C contains an overview of the examples. Annexes
    D to S contain examples of the application of the templates. Annex T provides
    mappings to existing standards. The Bibliography for ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2013
    is at the end of the document. ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2013 supports dynamic testing,
    functional and non-functional testing, manual and automated testing, and scripted
    and unscripted testing. The documentation templates defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3:2013
    can be used in conjunction with any software development lifecycle model.</p>"
