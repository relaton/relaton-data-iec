  content: "IEC 62037-2:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV defines a procedure to measure levels of
    passive intermodulation generated by a coaxial cable assembly. This test method
    is applicable to jumper cables, i.e. cable assemblies intended to provide interface
    flexibility between rigid devices. It is also used to evaluate cable assemblies
    that are subjected to motion in operation. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2012.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    criteria for application of mechanical stress revised to be a function of advertised
    cable bend radius."
