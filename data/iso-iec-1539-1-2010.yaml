    <p>ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs expressed in the base Fortran language. Its purpose is to promote portability, reliability, maintainability, and efficient execution of Fortran programs for use on a variety of computing systems.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 specifies</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the forms that a program written in the Fortran language may take,</li>
    <li>the rules for interpreting the meaning of a program and its data,</li>
    <li>the form of the input data to be processed by such a program, and</li>
    <li>the form of the output data resulting from the use of such a program.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Except where stated otherwise, requirements and prohibitions specified by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 apply to programs rather than processors.</p>
