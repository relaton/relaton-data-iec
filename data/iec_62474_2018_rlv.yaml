abstract:
- content: "IEC 62474:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62474:2018
    specifies the procedure, content, and form relating to material declarations for
    products of companies operating in and supplying the electrotechnical industry.
    Process chemicals and emissions during product use are not in the scope of this
    International Standard. It provides data to downstream manufacturers that:<br
    />\r\n- allows them to assess products against substance restriction compliance
    requirements;<br />\r\n- they can use in their environmentally conscious design
    process and across all product life cycle phases. A database associated with this
    document is available at http://std.iec.ch/iec62474. It contains the list of:<br
    />\r\n- Declarable substance groups and declarable substances;<br />\r\n- Reference
    Substances;<br />\r\n- Material classes;<br />\r\n- XML schema for data format
    and exchange and the accompanying developer table.<br />\r\nIEC 62474:2018 cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nIEC 62474:2018 includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The material classes
    and exemption lists capabilities have been improved.<br />\r\nb) The introduction
    and scope have new diagrams and information to give a better overview of the standard
    and identify what information is mandatory, optional or conditionally mandatory.<br
    />\r\nc) Definitions have been added. Minimum requirements to be in conformance
    with the IEC 62474 standard are defined, including XML format as the officially
    accepted format. By defining an authority, list identity and list version, the
    standard format could be used for lists other than the IEC 62474 database.<br
    />\r\nd) Terms have been aligned for consistency throughout the document. For
    example, the “IEC 62474 database” was previously referred to as “IEC 62474 database”,
    “IEC 62474”, “IEC 62474 Database”, “IEC 62474 DB”.<br />\r\ne) The annexes have
    been removed as they are now contained within documents managed by the validation
    team 62474 (VT 62474). Annex A (Annex B in the previous edition) is provided for
    non-XML users as a reference only."
