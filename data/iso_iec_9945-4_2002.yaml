abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 9945 (parts 1 to 4):2002 defines a standard operating system
    interface and environment, including a command interpreter (or "shell"), and common
    utility programs to support applications portability at the source code level.
    It is the single common revision to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1996),
    ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992), and the Base Specifications of The
    Open Group Single UNIX® Specification, Version 2. This standard is intended to
    be used by both applications developers and system implementors and comprises
    four major components (each in an associated volume):</p><p>General terms, concepts,
    and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions
    and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume
    (ISO/IEC 9945-1:2002).</p><p>Definitions for system service functions and subroutines,
    language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues,
    including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the
    System Interfaces volume (ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002).</p><p>Definitions for a standard
    source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a "shell2) and
    common utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell and
    Utilities volume (ISO/IEC 9945-3:2002).</p><p>Extended rationale that did not
    fit well into the rest of the document structure, containing historical information
    concerning the contents of this standard and why features were included or discarded
    by the standard developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume
    (ISO/IEC 9945-4:2002).</p><p>The following areas are outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    9945 (parts 1 to 4):2002:</p><ul><li>Graphics interfaces</li><li>Database management
    system interfaces</li><li>Record I/O considerations</li><li>Object or binary code
    portability</li><li>System configuration and resource availability</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    9945 (parts 1 to 4):2002 describes the external characteristics and facilities
    that are of importance to applications developers, rather than the internal construction
    techniques employed to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed
    on those functions and facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial
    applications.</p>
