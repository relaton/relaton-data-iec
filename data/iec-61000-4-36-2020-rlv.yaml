  content: "IEC 61000-4-36:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-36:2020
    provides methods to determine test levels for the assessment of the immunity of
    equipment and systems to intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI) sources.
    It introduces the general IEMI problem, IEMI source parameters, derivation of
    test limits and summarises practical test methods. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of a hyperband and mesoband
    radiated transients immunity test method in<br />\r\n- Annex H;<br />\r\n- addition
    of a calibration method of sensors for radiated hyperband and mesoband transient
    fields and measurement uncertainty in Annex I."
