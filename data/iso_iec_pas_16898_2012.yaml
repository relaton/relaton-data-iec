abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 specifies a designation system as well as the shapes
    and dimensions for secondary lithium-ion cells for integration into battery packs
    and systems used in electrically propelled road vehicles including the position
    of the terminals and any over-pressure safety device (OPSD). It is related to
    cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cells.<br /><br />\r\nThe cell designation according
    to ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 is intended to be applied to the cells used for electrically
    propelled road vehicles. ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 does not apply to cells specifically
    used for mopeds, motorcycles and vehicles not primarily defined as road vehicles,
    i.e. material handling trucks or forklifts.<br /><br />\r\nThe cell dimensions
    listed in ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 are recommended but not restricted for use in
    passenger cars up to 3,5 t.<br /><br />\r\nThe inner design, the cell chemistry,
    the electrical characteristics and any further properties of the cells are not
    defined in ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012."
