    <p>ISO/IEC 27036-3:2013 provides product and service acquirers and suppliers in the information and communication technology (ICT) supply chain with guidance on:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>gaining visibility into and managing the information security risks caused by physically dispersed and multi-layered ICT supply chains;</li>
    <li>responding to risks stemming from the global ICT supply chain to ICT products and services that can have an information security impact on the organizations using these products and services. These risks can be related to organizational as well as technical aspects (e.g. insertion of malicious code or presence of the counterfeit information technology (IT) products);</li>
    <li>integrating information security processes and practices into the system and software lifecycle processes, described in ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207, while supporting information security controls, described in ISO/IEC 27002.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>ISO/IEC 27036-3:2013 does not include business continuity management/resiliency issues involved with the ICT supply chain. ISO/IEC 27031 addresses business continuity.</p>
