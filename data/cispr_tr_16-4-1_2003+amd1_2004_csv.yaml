abstract:
- content: 'This part of CISPR 16-4 gives guidance on the treatment of uncertainties
    to those who are involved in the development or modification of CISPR electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) standards. In addition, this part provides useful background
    information for those who apply the standards and the uncertainty aspects in practice.
    The objectives of this part are: a) to identify the parameters or sources governing
    the uncertainty associated with the statement that a given product complies with
    the requirement specified in a CISPR recommendation. This uncertainty will be
    called ''standards compliance uncertainty'' (abbreviated as SCU, see 3.16); b)
    to give guidance on the estimation of the magnitude of the standards compliance
    uncertainty; c) to give guidance for the implementation of the standards compliance
    uncertainty into the compliance criterion of a CISPR standardised compliance test.
    As such, this part can be considered as a handbook that can be used by standards
    writers to incorporate and harmonise uncertainty considerations in existing and
    future CISPR standards. This part also gives guidance to regulatory authorities,
    accreditation bodies and test engineers to judge the performance quality of an
    EMC test-laboratory carrying out CISPR standardised compliance tests. The uncertainty
    considerations given in this part can also be used as guidance when comparing
    test results (and its uncertainties) obtained by using different alternative test
    methods. The uncertainty of a compliance test also relates to the probability
    of occurrence of an electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem in practice. This
    aspect is recognized and introduced briefly in this part. However, the problem
    of relating uncertainties of a compliance test to the occurrence of EMI in practice
    is not considered within the scope of this part. This consolidated version consists
    of the first edition (2003) and its amendment 1 (2004). Therefore, no need to
    order amendment in addition to this publication.'
