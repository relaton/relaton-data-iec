abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 30130:2016 defines the framework to which capabilities of software
    testing tools are allocated in order to identify the capabilities of products
    being used by any project for software testing. Software testing processes are
    identified in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119â€‘2 and software verification processes are identified
    in ISO/IEC 12207. This International Standard is fully harmonized with these existing
    standards in terms of software testing processes.<p>ISO/IEC 30130:2016 focuses
    on the following areas that the existing ISO/IEC standards do not deal with the
    following:</p><p>- categorization of software test entities and software testing
    tools (Clauses 4 and 5);</p><p>- characterization of each software testing tool
    category (Clauses 5 and 6);</p><p>- mapping of software testing tool capabilities
    and characteristics (Clauses 6 and 7).</p>
