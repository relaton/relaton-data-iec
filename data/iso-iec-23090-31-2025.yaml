    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies technology that supports the efficient transmission and rendering of haptic signals for the playback of immersive experiences in a wide variety of scenarios. The document describes in detail a robust coded representation of haptic media covering the two most popular haptic perceptions leveraged by devices today: vibrotactile and kinaesthetic. Support for other haptic modalities has also been integrated.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The coded representation allows to encode both descriptive and quantized data in a human readable JSON format used for exchange purposes, and a compressed bitstream version, optimised for memory usage and distribution purposes. This approach also allows to meet the expectations for compatibility with both descriptive and quantized formats, as required by the market, as well as interoperability between devices for 3D immersive experiences, mobile applications and other distribution purposes.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Information provided in this document related to the decoder is normative, while information related to the encoder and renderer is informative.</span></p>
