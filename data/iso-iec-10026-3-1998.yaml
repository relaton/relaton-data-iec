    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10026 provides</p>
    <p>a) a statement (clauses 6 to 11) of the nature of the automaton giving the necessary behaviour of each of</p>
    <p>the participating entities which are providing the OSI TP Service, covering</p>
    <p>1) the actions to be taken on receiving request and response primitives issued by a TP Service user</p>
    <p>invocation;</p>
    <p>2) the actions to be taken on receiving indication and confirm primitives issued by the presentation</p>
    <p>service-provider;</p>
    <p>3) the actions to be taken as a result of certain events within the local system;</p>
    <p>4) the actions to be taken as a result of interactions with other ASEs;</p>
    <p>b) the definition (clause 12) of the abstract syntax required to convey the TP protocol control information;</p>
    <p>c) the conformance requirements to be met by implementations of this protocol (clause 13).</p>
    <p>The scope of this part of ISO/IEC 10026 is limited to the interconnection of systems; it does not specify or</p>
    <p>restrict the implementation of possible interfaces within a computer system.</p>
