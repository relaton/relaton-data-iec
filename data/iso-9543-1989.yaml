  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />Prescribes quality requirements for
    serial data transmission at the interface between synchronous transmission Data
    Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-terminating Equipment in conformance with
    the CCITT Recommendations V.24 (telephone networks), X.24 (data networks) as specified
    in DCEs of the corresponding CCITT-Recommendations. Takes into account the need
    to have performance cotegories of signal quality depending on the type of interchange
    circuits.
