abstract:
- content: "This document defines a set of environmental performance evaluation (EPE)
    data classes, including their properties.<br />\r\nIt is applicable to entire
    manufacturing facilities or to parts of a manufacturing facility.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to manufacturing systems including discrete, batch and continuous
    control, which are defined in IEC 62264-1.<br />\r\nThe following are outside
    the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- syntax of EPE data and data models;<br
    />\r\n- protocols to exchange EPE data;<br />\r\n- functions that can be enabled
    by the use of EPE data;<br />\r\n- product life cycle assessment;<br />\r\n- EPE
    data that are specific to a particular industry sector, manufacturer or machinery;<br
    />\r\n- acquisition of EPE data."
