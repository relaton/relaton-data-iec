abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63162:2025, which is a Technical Specification, provides failure
    rates at reference conditions for electric components, considering reference conditions
    defined in IEC 61709.<br />\r\nReference conditions are useful since they provide
    a known standard basis from which failure rates can be modified to account for
    differences in environment from the environments taken as reference conditions.<br
    />\r\nTo perform reliability prediction, which is described in IEC 61709:2017,
    Annex C, failure rates, together with assumptions and limitations, are used.<br
    />\r\nIEC 61709 does not provide failure rates for components, but only provides
    models that allow failure rates obtained by other means to be converted from one
    operating condition to another operating condition.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    generic failure rates considering those contained in the list of selected sources,
    calculated at reference conditions, as defined in IEC 61709. In fact, although
    models are different, calculated values at reference conditions do not appear
    to be so different, hence allowing a consistent converging process. See also IEC
    61709:2017, 4.6.<br />\r\nEach user can easily calculate failure rates at any
    condition using IEC 61709."
