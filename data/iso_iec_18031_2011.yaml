    for cryptographic purposes, together with the elements of this model.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    18031:2011</p><ul><li>specifies the characteristics of the main elements required
    for a non-deterministic random bit generator,</li><li>specifies the characteristics
    of the main elements required for a deterministic random bit generator,</li><li>establishes
    the security requirements for both the non-deterministic and the deterministic
    random bit generator.</li></ul><p>Where there is a requirement to produce sequences
    of random numbers from random bit strings, ISO/IEC 18031:2011 gives guidelines
    on how this can be performed.</p><p>Techniques for statistical testing of random
    bit generators for the purposes of independent verification or validation, and
    detailed designs for such generators, are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18031:2011.</p>"
