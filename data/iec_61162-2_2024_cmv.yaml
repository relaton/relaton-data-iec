abstract:
- content: "IEC 61162-2:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61162-2:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 61162-1:1998
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 80 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61162-2:2024 contains the requirements for data communication
    between maritime electronic instruments, navigation and radiocommunication equipment
    when interconnected via an appropriate interface. This document is intended to
    support one-way serial data transmission from a single talker to one or more listeners.
    This data is in printable ASCII form and can include any information as specified
    by approved sentences or information coded according to the rules for proprietary
    sentences. Typical messages can be from 11 to a maximum of 79 characters in length
    and generally require repetition rates up to once per 20 ms. The electrical definitions
    in this document are intended to accommodate higher data rates than are specified
    in IEC 61162-1. Since there is no provision for guaranteed delivery of messages
    and only limited error-checking capability, it is important this document is used
    with caution in all safety applications."
