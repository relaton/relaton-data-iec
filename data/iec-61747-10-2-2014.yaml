    IEC 61747-10-2:2014(E) lists test methods applicable to liquid crystal display devices. It takes into account, wherever possible, the environmental test methods outlined in IEC 60068. The object of this standard is to establish uniform preferred test methods with preferred values for stress levels for judging the environmental properties of liquid crystal display devices. This first edition of IEC 61747-10-2 cancels and replaces Clauses 1 and 3 of the first edition of IEC 61747-5 published in 1998. This edition constitutes a technical revision with the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    a) Examples of the test conditions have been added to each test method;<br />
    b) References cited have been updated.
