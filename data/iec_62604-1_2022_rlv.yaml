abstract:
- content: "IEC 62604-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62604-1:2022
    specifies the methods of test and general requirements for SAW and BAW duplexers
    of assessed quality using either capability approval or qualification approval
    procedures. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the term \"multiplexer\" has
    been added to Clause 3.<br />\r\nNOTE In this document, SAW and BAW duplexers
    are treated simultaneously because both duplexers are used in the same manner
    especially in mobile phones and have the same requirements of characteristics,
    test method and so on."
