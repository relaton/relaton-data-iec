  content: "IEC 60269-3:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60269-3:2024 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60269-3:2010+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2019
    CSV edition 4.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 32B experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60269-3:2024 is divided into four fuse systems,
    each dealing with a specific example of standardized fuses for use by unskilled
    persons. This part applies to “gG” fuses only. Unskilled persons do not have technical
    knowledge or sufficient experience. To avoid dangers, which electricity may create,
    the relevant part of the fuse standard shall provide requirements for maximum
    safety in service. IEC 60269-3 provides four systems for use by unskilled persons.
    Instructions for the safe operation of fuse-links are provided in the manufacturer’s
    literature. All systems provide their own mechanical solution to avoid the use
    of a fuse-link with higher current rating (non-interchangeability) whereas the
    protection of cables and lines is ensured. The applicant is required to take care
    to replace a fuse-link by the same type.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum
    1 (2025-11) has been included in this copy."
