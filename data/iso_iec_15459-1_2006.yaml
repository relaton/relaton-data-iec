abstract:
- content: 'Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as address, order number, contents of the item, weight, sender, batch or
    lot number, etc. The information is often held on computer systems, and may be
    exchanged between parties involved via EDI (Electronic Data Interchange) and XML
    (eXtensible Markup Language) messages.There are considerable benefits if the identity
    of the item is represented in bar code format, or other AIDC (Automatic Identification
    and Data Capture) media and attached to or made a constituent part of that which
    is being uniquely identified so thatit can be read electronically, thus minimising
    errors;one identifier can be used by all parties;each party can use the identifier
    to look up its computer files to find the data associated with the item;the identifier
    is unique within the class and cannot appear on any other item of the class during
    the lifetime of the item.The unique identifier for transport units defined in
    ISO/IEC 15459-1:2006 and represented in a bar code label, two-dimensional symbol,
    radio-frequency identification tag, or other AIDC media attached to the item meets
    these needs. All AIDC technologies have the potential to encode a unique identifier.
    It is expected that application standards for items, using various automatic identification
    technologies, will be developed based upon the unique identifier as a prime key.
    These application standards may be made available from the Issuing Agency.ISO/IEC
    15459-1:2006 specifies a unique, non-significant, string of characters for the
    identification of transport units. The character string is intended to be represented
    in a bar code label or other AIDC media attached to the item to meet item management
    needs. To address management needs different classes of items are recognized in
    the various parts of ISO/IEC 15459, which allows different requirements to be
    met by the unique identifiers associated with each class. The rules for the unique
    identifier for transport units, to identify physical logistical transfers, with
    the identity relevant for the duration of one or more items in the load being
    held or transported as part of that load, are defined and supported by an example.'
