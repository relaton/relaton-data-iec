  content: "IEC TR 63292:2020 continues the effort started with the availability technical
    specification (IEC TS 63019). Availability is closely related to PVPS operational
    capability, health and condition and to produce energy and is a real-time or historical
    measure. The availability of a system or component is impacted by contractual
    and non-contractual reliability specifications, maintenance metrics and a corresponding
    maintenance and repair strategy, and also external factors such as site environmental
    and grid conditions. The intention of this document is to be a precursor examination
    of the reliability issues for further address in a task to produce an IEC Technical
    Specification on this topic.<br />\r\nWhile this document identifies reliability
    tools, topics and procedures, there are commercial products available to perform
    analyses and there is no assessment of those tools or to provide recommendations
    for one tool over another in this document."
