    of safety publications in addition to ISO/IEC Guide 51, including the preparation
    and use of basic safety publications and group safety publications. Also describes
    the relationship between TCs with horizontal safety functions or group safety
    functions and product TCs. In the context of this guide, \"safety\" relates to
    the safety of persons, domestic animals, livestock and property.<br />\r\nThe
    main changes with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- alignment
    with terms and definitions of ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014;<br />\r\n- reference to IEC
    Guide 108 in the introduction;<br />\r\n- creation of BASIC SAFETY PUBLICATION
    and GROUP SAFETY PUBLICATION subcategories to clarify the different types of document
    (requirements, guidance, mandatory test procedures and reference data);<br />\r\n-
    improved structure: new titles and subclauses;<br />\r\n- addition to the responsibilities
    of the technical committees (TCs) with HORIZONTAL SAFETY FUNCTION: development
    of their publications in collaboration with customer TCs and monitoring the use
    of their SAFETY publications;<br />\r\n- replacement of Annex A and the associated
    text by reference to IEC Guide 116;<br />\r\n- shortened status statement for
