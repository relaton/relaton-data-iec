abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20248:2022 This document is an ISO/IEC 9594‑8 [public key infrastructure
    (PKI) digital signatures and certificates] application specification for automated
    identification services. It specifies a method whereby data stored within a barcode
    and/or RFID tag are structured, encoded and digitally signed. ISO/IEC 9594‑8 is
    used to provide a standard method for key and data description management and
    distribution. The data capacity and/or data transfer capacity of automated identification
    data carriers are restricted. This restricts the normal use of a digital signature
    as specified in ISO/IEC 9594‑8 within automated identification services.<br />\r\nThe
    purpose of this document is to provide an open and interoperable method, between
    automated identification services and data carriers, to read data, verify data
    originality and data integrity in an offline use case.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies<br />\r\n- the meta data structure, the DigSig, which contains the digital
    signature and encoded structured data,<br />\r\n- the public key certificate parameter
    and extension use, the DigSig certificate, which contains the certified associated
    public key, the structured data description, the read methods, and private containers,<br
    />\r\n- the method to specify, read, describe, sign, verify, encode, and decode
    the structured data, the DigSig Data Description,<br />\r\n- the DigSig EncoderGenerator
    which generates the relevant asymmetric key pairs, keeps the private key secret,
    and generates the DigSigs, and<br />\r\n- the DigSig DecoderVerifier which, by
    using to the DigSig certificate, reads the DigSig from the set of data carriers,
    verifies the DigSig and extracts the structured data from the DigSig.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not specify<br />\r\n- cryptographic methods, or<br />\r\n- key
    management methods."
