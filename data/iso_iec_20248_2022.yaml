abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an ISO/IEC 9594‑8 [public key infrastructure (PKI)
    digital signatures and certificates] application specification for automated identification
    services. It specifies a method whereby data stored within a barcode and/or RFID
    tag are structured, encoded and digitally signed. ISO/IEC 9594‑8 is used to provide
    a standard method for key and data description management and distribution. The
    data capacity and/or data transfer capacity of automated identification data carriers
    are restricted. This restricts the normal use of a digital signature as specified
    in ISO/IEC 9594‑8 within automated identification services.</p><p>The purpose
    of this document is to provide an open and interoperable method, between automated
    identification services and data carriers, to read data, verify data originality
    and data integrity in an offline use case.</p><p>This document specifies</p><p>—
    the meta data structure, the DigSig, which contains the digital signature and
    encoded structured data,</p><p>— the public key certificate parameter and extension
    use, the DigSig certificate, which contains the certified associated public key,
    the structured data description, the read methods, and private containers,</p><p>—
    the method to specify, read, describe, sign, verify, encode, and decode the structured
    data, the DigSig Data Description,</p><p>— the DigSig EncoderGenerator which generates
    the relevant asymmetric key pairs, keeps the private key secret, and generates
    the DigSigs, and</p><p>— the DigSig DecoderVerifier which, by using to the DigSig
    certificate, reads the DigSig from the set of data carriers, verifies the DigSig
    and extracts the structured data from the DigSig.</p><p>This document does not
    specify</p><p>— cryptographic methods, or</p><p>— key management methods.</p>"
