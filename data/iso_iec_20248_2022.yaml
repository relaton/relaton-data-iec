- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document is an ISO/IEC 9594‑8
    [public key infrastructure (PKI) digital signatures and certificates] application
    specification for automated identification services. It specifies a method whereby
    data stored within a barcode and/or RFID tag are structured, encoded and digitally
    signed. ISO/IEC 9594‑8 is used to provide a standard method for key and data description
    management and distribution. The data capacity and/or data transfer capacity of
    automated identification data carriers are restricted. This restricts the normal
    use of a digital signature as specified in ISO/IEC 9594‑8 within automated identification
    services.</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide an open and interoperable
    method, between automated identification services and data carriers, to read data,
    verify data originality and data integrity in an offline use case.</p><p>This
    document specifies</p><p>— the meta data structure, the DigSig, which contains
    the digital signature and encoded structured data,</p><p>— the public key certificate
    parameter and extension use, the DigSig certificate, which contains the certified
    associated public key, the structured data description, the read methods, and
    private containers,</p><p>— the method to specify, read, describe, sign, verify,
    encode, and decode the structured data, the DigSig Data Description,</p><p>— the
    DigSig EncoderGenerator which generates the relevant asymmetric key pairs, keeps
    the private key secret, and generates the DigSigs, and</p><p>— the DigSig DecoderVerifier
    which, by using to the DigSig certificate, reads the DigSig from the set of data
    carriers, verifies the DigSig and extracts the structured data from the DigSig.</p><p>This
    document does not specify</p><p>— cryptographic methods, or</p><p>— key management
    methods.</p>
