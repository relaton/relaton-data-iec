abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-24:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60749-24:2025
    specifies unbiased highly accelerated stress testing (HAST). HAST is performed
    for the purpose of evaluating the reliability of non-hermetically packaged solid-state
    devices in humid environments. It is a highly accelerated test which employs temperature
    and humidity under non-condensing conditions to accelerate the penetration of
    moisture through the external protective material (encapsulant or seal) or along
    the interface between the external protective material and the metallic conductors
    which pass through it. Bias is not applied in this test to ensure that the failure
    mechanisms potentially overshadowed by bias can be uncovered (e.g. galvanic corrosion).<br
    />\r\nThis test is used to identify failure mechanisms internal to the package
    and is destructive.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) rearrangement of clauses
    to reposition requirements;<br />\r\nb) addition of two notes to the post-test
    electrical procedures."
