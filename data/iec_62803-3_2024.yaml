abstract:
- content: "IEC 62803-3:2024 specifies the measurement method of the non-linear response
    of optical­to­electric converters in both optical signal transport systems and
    RoF systems. The method applies for the following:<br />\r\n- frequency range:
    up to 170 GHz;<br />\r\n- wavelength band: 0,8 µm to 2,0 µm."
