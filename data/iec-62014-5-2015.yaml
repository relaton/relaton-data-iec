  content: IEC 62014-5:2015(E) defines a standard XML format for representing electronic
    design intellectual property (IP) quality information, based on an information
    model for IP quality measurement. It includes a schema and the terms that are
    relevant for measuring IP quality, including the software that executes on the
    system. The schema and information model can be focused to represent particular
    categories of interest to IP users.
