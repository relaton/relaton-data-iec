abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-501:2013(E) specifies requirements for all electric propulsion
    plants and gives the specifications, system design, installation and testing of
    at least:<br />\r\n- generators and their prime movers;<br />\r\n- switchboards;<br
    />\r\n- transformers/reactors;<br />\r\n- semiconductor convertors;<br />\r\n-
    propulsion motors;<br />\r\n- excitation systems;<br />\r\n- control, monitoring
    and safety systems;<br />\r\n- wires, cables, busbars, trunking systems;<br />\r\n-
    harmonic filters.<br />\r\nBow and stern thrusters intended as auxiliary steering
    devices, booster and take-home devices, all auxiliary generating plants, and accumulator
    battery powered propulsion machinery and equipment are excluded. This fifth edition
    cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2007. It constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition included the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) requirements regarding system responsibility,
    electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), harmonic distortion and filtering, special
    requirements for ships with propulsion motor(s) and podded drives, and power management
    system (PMS);<br />\r\nb) overall technical review to update the standard according
    to general requirements and referenced equipment standards."
