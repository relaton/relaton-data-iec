abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-501:2013(E) specifies requirements for all electric propulsion
    plants and gives the specifications, system design, installation and testing of
    at least:<br /> \n- generators and their prime movers;<br />\n- switchboards;<br
    /> \n- transformers/reactors;<br /> \n- semiconductor convertors;<br />\n- propulsion
    motors;<br />\n- excitation systems;<br />\n- control, monitoring and safety systems;<br
    />\n- wires, cables, busbars, trunking systems;<br />\n- harmonic filters.<br
    />\nBow and stern thrusters intended as auxiliary steering devices, booster and
    take-home devices, all auxiliary generating plants, and accumulator battery powered
    propulsion machinery and equipment are excluded. This fifth edition cancels and
    replaces the fourth edition published in 2007. It constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition included the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\na) requirements regarding system responsibility,
    electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), harmonic distortion and filtering, special
    requirements for ships with propulsion motor(s) and podded drives, and power management
    system (PMS);<br /> \nb) overall technical review to update the standard according
    to general requirements and referenced equipment standards."
