abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoNormal">This document defines QuadBPT and TriBPT image components,
    collectively known as "breakpoint components", and specifies decoding and reconstruction
    procedures for recovering breakpoint component sample values from the codestream.
    This Recommendation | International Standard also specifies "breakpoint-dependent"
    spatial wavelet transforms that can be used in place of the transforms specified
    in Recommendation ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 for selected image components
    or tile-components. Extensions to the codestream syntax of Rec. ITUâ€‘T T.800 |
    ISO/IEC 15444-1 are specified to enable the identification of breakpoint components,
    of components that can use a breakpoint-dependent spatial wavelet transform, and
    the association of breakpoint components with such breakpoint-dependent wavelet
    transforms.</p>
