  content: ISO/IEC 11553-3:2013 describes the requirements to deal with noise hazards
    and specifies all the information necessary to carry out efficiently and under
    standardized conditions the determination, declaration and verification of airborne
    noise emission from laser processing machines and hand-held laser processing devices
    within the scope of ISO/IEC 11553-1 and ISO/IEC 11553-2. It specifies the safety
    requirements relating to noise hazards. It specifies noise measurement methods,
    installation and operating conditions to be used for the test, together with the
    information to be supplied by manufacturers of such equipment. ISO/IEC 11553-3:2013
    applies to those laser processing machines and hand-held laser processing devices
    included in the scope of ISO/IEC 11553-1 and ISO/IEC 11553-2. Noise emission characteristics
    include emission sound pressure levels at work stations and the sound power level.
    Declared noise emission values permit comparison of laser processing machines
    and hand-held laser processing devices on the market. The use of this noise test
    code (see Annex A) ensures the reproducibility of the determination of the characteristic
    noise emission values within specific limits. These limits are determined by the
    accuracy grade of the noise emission measuring method used. Noise emission measurements
    specified by ISO/IEC 11553-3:2013 meet the requirements of an engineering method
    (accuracy grade 2).
