  content: "IEC TR 60909-4:2021 which is a Technical Report, is intended to give help
    for the application of IEC 60909-0 for the calculation of short-circuit currents
    in 50 Hz or 60 Hz three-phase AC systems.<br />\r\nThis document does not include
    additional requirements but gives support for the modelling of electrical equipment
    in the positive-sequence, the negative-sequence and the zero-sequence system (Clause
    4), the practical execution of calculations in a low-voltage system (Clause 5),
    a medium-voltage system with asynchronous motors (Clause 6) and a power station
    unit with its auxiliary network feeding a large number of medium-voltage asynchronous
    motors and low-voltage motor groups (Clause 7).<br />\r\nThe three examples given
    in Clauses 5, 6 and 7 are similar to those given in IEC TR 60909-4:2000 but they
    are revised in accordance with IEC 60909-0, which replaces it. The example given
    in Clause 8 is new and mirrors the introduction of the new 6.8 of IEC 60909-0:2016.<br
    />\r\nClause 9 gives the circuit diagram and the data of a test network and the
    results for a calculation carried out in accordance with IEC 60909-0, to offer
    the possibility for a comparison between the results found with a digital program
    for the calculation of short-circuit currents and the given results for and in
    a high-voltage network with power station units, generators, asynchronous motors
    and lines in four different voltage levels 380 kV, 110 kV, 30 kV and 10 kV.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2000. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) adaption to IEC 60909-0:2016;<br />\r\nb) addition of an example for
    the calculation of short-circuit currents of wind power station units;<br />\r\nc)
    correction of errors."
