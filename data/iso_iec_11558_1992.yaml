abstract:
- content: Specifies a lossless compression algorithm (DCLZ - Data Compression according
    to Lempel and Ziv) to reduce the number of bits required to represent information
    coded by means of 8-bit bytes. This algorithm is particularly useful when information
    has to be recorded on an interchangeable medium. Its use is not limited to this
    application.
