    <p>ISO 7816-8:2016 specifies interindustry commands that may be used for security operations. This document also provides informative directives on how to construct security mechanisms with ISO/IEC 7816‑4 defined commands.</p>
    <p>The choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanism in security operations may affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of algorithms and protocols is outside the scope of this document. It does not cover the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside world.</p>
