    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 29107-1:2010 specifies the concept for a taxonomy of standards and
    other related specifications applicable to intelligent homes. It is intended for
    the classification of specifications from ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU and from
    organizations with liaison status with any of these. It is intended to the various
    standardisation bodies that are contributing to the intelligent home. With the
    help of the concept described in this report they should be able to classify their
    specifications. This will benefit the standardisation bodies to determine if there
    are overlapping specifications or areas for which specifications are missing."
