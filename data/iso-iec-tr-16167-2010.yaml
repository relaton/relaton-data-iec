    <p>ISO/IEC TR 16167:2010 discusses issues related to emergency calls from an enterprise user to a public or enterprise emergency response centre (ERC) using the Session Initiation Protocol within the Next Generation Corporate Network. It uses terminology and concepts developed in ISO/IEC TR 12860. It identifies a number of requirements impacting Next Generation Network standardization and concerning deployment of enterprise networks. </p>
    <p>The scope of ISO/IEC TR 16167:2010 is limited to calls from an enterprise user to an authority, where the authority is represented by a public or a private ERC. This includes the special case where a private ERC acts as an enterprise user in making an emergency call to a public ERC.</p>
