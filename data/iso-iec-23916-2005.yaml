    <p>ISO/IEC 23916:2005 specifies call transfer interworking between the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and "QSIG" within corporate telecommunication networks (CN), also known as enterprise networks.</p>
    <p>"QSIG" is a signalling protocol that operates between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users.</p>
    <p>SIP is an application layer protocol for establishing, terminating and modifying multimedia sessions. It is typically carried over IP. Telephone calls are considered as a type of multimedia session where just audio is exchanged. </p>
    <p>As the support of telephony within corporate networks evolves from circuit-switched technology to Internet technology, the two technologies will co-exist in many networks for a period, perhaps several years. Therefore, there is a need to be able to establish, modify, terminate and transfer sessions involving participants in the SIP network and participants in the QSIG network. Such calls are supported by gateways that perform interworking between SIP and QSIG.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23916:2005 specifies SIP-QSIG signalling interworking for transfer services between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP.</p>
