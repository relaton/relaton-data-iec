  content: IEC TR 63196:2020 is following the principles of IEC Guide 119. This document
    defines the energy efficiency aspects of switchgear and controlgear products complying
    with IEC 60947 (all parts), IEC 61095 and IEC 62626 (all parts), and associated
    assemblies complying with IEC 61439 (all parts), in the context of the overall
    system energy efficiency. This document references energy policy aspects, as well
    as product and system aspects.
