- content: ISO/IEC 24738:2006 defines a consistent set of icon symbols and related
    attributes that are presented on a computer screen and with which users interact
    to decide whether or not to take the associated link. These symbols represent
    attributes of the link and/or the destination of the link. Link attribute icon
    symbols enable users to decide on the suitability of following associated hyperlinks.
    Information provided by these icon symbols may also be made available via text.
    ISO/IEC 24738:2006 provides guidance on the graphics to be used by implementers
    of ISO 14915-2, Software ergonomics for multimedia user interfaces -- Multimedia
    navigation and control.The icon symbol graphics included in ISO/IEC 24738:2006
    have been selected on the basis of their ability to convey the desired information
    to a wide audience of users.ISO/IEC 24738:2006 applies to icons that are shown
    on a computer screen in conjunction with a link also shown on that screen. It
    describes user interaction with and the appearance of link attribute icons on
    the screen. Other forms of icons are covered in ISO/IEC 11581, Information technology
    -- User system interfaces and symbols -- Icon symbols and functions.
