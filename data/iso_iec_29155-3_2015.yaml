abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29155-3:2015 provides general requirements and guidance for reporting
    processes and contents of typical reports within benchmarking activities of \"the
    information technology (IT) project performance benchmarking framework\" by prescribing:<br
    />\r\n- requirements and guidance for the reporting processes within the benchmarking
    framework;<br />\r\n- requirements and guidance for the contents of reports.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 29155-3:2015 focuses on three major activities, i.e. \"conduct benchmarking\",
    \"maintain repository\", and \"issue benchmarks\" activities.<br />\r\nNOTE 1
    These activities are selected, not only because the importance of the outcomes
    of these activities, but also the outcomes of these activities are the direct
    input for benchmarking users who execute \"core benchmarking\" activities. In
    addition, benchmarking users are not usually so deeply involved to these activities
    even though they need in-deep information to understand the benchmarking results
    or to select appropriate data (i.e. benchmarking repository and benchmarks).<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 29155-3:2015 also focuses on two types of reports in the benchmarking
    framework:<br />\r\na) the benchmarking report, that describes the results of
    an instance of benchmarking;<br />\r\nb) the explanatory report, that provides
    complementary information about the released benchmarking repository or benchmark(s).<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 29155-3:2015 is intended for use by stakeholder(s) of IT project
    performance benchmarking (e.g. benchmarking user, benchmark provider, and benchmarking
    service provider).<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The following are examples of how this part
    of ISO/IEC 29155 can be used:<br />\r\n- by a systems and software acquirer (or
    a third-party agent), to define, order, obtain and evaluate an acceptable and
    creditable benchmarking report;<br />\r\n- by a benchmarking service provider,
    to produce a high-quality benchmarking report;<br />\r\n- by a benchmark provider,
    to provide complementary information about the released benchmarking repository
    or issued benchmarks.<br />\r\nIt is out of the scope of this part of ISO/IEC
    29115 to prescribe the particular names, formats, or explicit contents of the
    reports of the benchmarking activities."
