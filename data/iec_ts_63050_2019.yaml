abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63050:2019 applies to all types of dosemeters, irrespective of
    the type of radiation intended to be measured. Tests according to this document
    determine whether a single radiation pulse can be measured correctly even if the
    dosemeter is in the internal state relevant for measuring background or environmental
    radiation.<br />\r\nThe annex in the document gives some parameter values for
    typical workplaces where pulsed radiation occurs.<br />\r\nThis document considers
    the pulsation of the radiation field as an additional influence quantity like
    particle energy and direction of radiation incidence. Therefore, the tests described
    are additional to all the tests in the instrument specific standards. This document
    describes methods to determine the following characteristic parameters of the
    dosemeters:\r\n\r\n\tthe maximum measurable dose rate in the pulse, Hmeas,max\r\n\tthe
    maximum measurable dose in the pulse, Hmeas,max\r\n\tthe minimal pulse duration,
    tmeas,min and\r\n\tthe range for the pulse repetition frequency, fmeas,min to
    fmeas,max"
