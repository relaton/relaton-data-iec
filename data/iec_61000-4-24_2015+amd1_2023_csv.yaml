abstract:
- content: IEC 61000-4-24:2015+AMD1:2023 deals with methods for testing protective
    devices for HEMP conducted disturbance. It includes two-terminal elements, such
    as gas discharge tubes, varistors, and two-port SPDs, such as HEMP combination
    filters. It covers testing of voltage breakdown and voltage-limiting characteristics
    but also methods to measure the residual voltage and/or the residual current,
    peak rate of rise and root action for the case of very fast changes of voltage
    and current as a function of time. It has the status of a basic EMC publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 107. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
