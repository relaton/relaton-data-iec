    18025:2014 provides mechanisms to specify unambiguously objects used to model
    environmental concepts. To accomplish this, a collection of nine EDCS dictionaries
    of environmental concepts are specified:<br />\r\n1. classifications: specify
    the type of environmental objects;<br />\r\n2. attributes: specify the state of
    environmental objects;<br />\r\n3. attribute value characteristics: specify information
    concerning the values of attributes;<br />\r\n4. attribute enumerants: specify
    the allowable values for the state of an enumerated attribute;<br />\r\n5. units:
    specify quantitative measures of the state of some environmental objects;<br />\r\n6.
    unit scales: allow a wide range of numerical values to be stated;<br />\r\n7.
    unit equivalence classes: specify sets of units that are mutually comparable;<br
    />\r\n8. organizational schemas: useful for locating classifications and attributes
    sharing a common context; and<br />\r\n9. groups: into which concepts sharing
    a common context are collected.<br />\r\nA functional interface is also specified.
    As denoting and encoding a concept requires a standard way of identifying the
    concept, ISO/IEC 18025:2014 specifies labels and codes in the dictionaries. ISO/IEC
    18025:2014 specifies environmental phenomena in categories that include, but are
    not limited to, the following:<br />\r\n1. abstract concepts (e.g., absolute latitude
    accuracy, geodetic azimuth);<br />\r\n2. airborne particulates and aerosols (e.g.,
    cloud, dust, fog, snow);<br />\r\n3. animals (e.g., civilian, fish, human, whale
    pod);<br />\r\n4. atmosphere and atmospheric conditions (e.g., air temperature,
    humidity, rain rate, sensible and latent heat, wind speed and direction);<br />\r\n5.
    bathymetric physiography (e.g., bar, channel, continental shelf, guyot, reef,
    seamount, waterbody floor region);<br />\r\n6. electromagnetic and acoustic phenomena
    (e.g., acoustic noise, frequency, polarization, sound speed profile, surface reflectivity);<br
    />\r\n7. equipment (e.g., aircraft, spacecraft, tent, train, vessel);<br />\r\n8.
    extraterrestrial phenomena (e.g., asteroid, comet, planet);<br />\r\n9. hydrology
    (e.g., lake, rapids, river, swamp);<br />\r\n10. ice (e.g., iceberg, ice field,
    ice peak, ice shelf, glacier);<br />\r\n11. man-made structures and their interiors
    (e.g., bridge, building, hallway, road, room, tower);<br />\r\n12. ocean and littoral
    surface phenomena (e.g., beach profile, current, surf, tide, wave);<br />\r\n13.
    ocean floor (e.g., coral, rock, sand);<br />\r\n14. oceanographic conditions (e.g.,
    luminescence, salinity, specific gravity, turbidity, water current speed);<br
    />\r\n15. physiography (e.g., cliff, gorge, island, mountain, reef, strait, valley
    region);<br />\r\n16. space (e.g., charged particle species, ionospheric scintillation,
    magnetic field, particle density, solar flares);<br />\r\n17. surface materials
    (e.g., concrete, metal, paint, soil); and<br />\r\n18. vegetation (e.g., crop
    land, forest, grass land, kelp bed, tree)."
