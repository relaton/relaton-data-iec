  content: "IEC 60092-352:2025 provides the basic requirements for the selection,
    installation and operating conditions of electrical cables intended for fixed
    electrical systems on board ships at voltages (U) up to and including Um 18/30
    (36) kV, symmetrical category cables and fibre optic cables.<br />\r\nThe reference
    to fixed systems includes those that are subjected to vibration (due to the movement
    of the ship) or movement (due to motion of the ship) and not to those that are
    intended for frequent flexing.<br />\r\nCables subject to frequent or continual
    flexing use, which can withstand the mechanical stress and the environment they
    are exposed to, are detailed in other IEC specifications such as IEC 60227 and
    IEC 60245. Flexible cables are frequently used for retractable thrusters, elevators,
    moving decks, cranes, shore connections and other moving applications on board
    ships.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) modification of the part title;<br />\r\nb) complete review
    of the document and establishment of the match with all other standards from the
    group IEC 60092-350 to IEC 60092-379;<br />\r\nc) addition of terms and definitions;<br
    />\r\nd) addition of technical requirements for the installation of symmetrical
    category cables with transmission characteristics up to 1 000 MHz;<br />\r\ne)
    addition of the technical requirements for the installation of fibre optic cables;<br
    />\r\nf) addition of technical requirements for the installation of cables for
    installation between areas with and without explosive atmospheres"
