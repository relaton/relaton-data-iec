abstract:
- content: IEC 62891:2020 provides a procedure for the measurement of the efficiency
    of the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of inverters used in grid-connected
    photovoltaic (PV) systems. Both the static and dynamic MPPT efficiency are considered.
    Based on the static MPPT efficiency calculated in this document and steady state
    conversion efficiency determined in IEC 61683 the overall efficiency can be calculated.
    The dynamic MPPT efficiency is indicated separately.
