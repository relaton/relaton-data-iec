abstract:
- content: "IEC 62153-4-3:2013+AMD1:2024 CSV determines the screening effectiveness
    of a cable shield by applying a well-defined current and voltage to the screen
    of the cable and measuring the induced voltage in order to determine the surface
    transfer impedance. This test measures only the magnetic component of the transfer
    impedance. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- now three different test configurations are described;<br />\r\n- formulas
    to calculate the maximum frequency up to which the different test configurations
    can be used are included;<br />\r\n- the effect of ground loops is described."
