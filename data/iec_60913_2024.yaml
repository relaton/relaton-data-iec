abstract:
- content: "IEC 60913:2024 specifies the requirements and tests for the design of
    overhead contact line systems, requirements for structures and their structural
    calculations and verifications as well as the requirements and tests for the design
    of assemblies and individual parts. This document is applicable to electric traction
    overhead contact line systems in heavy railways, light railways, for trolley bus
    lines, electric road systems (Annex E) and industrial railways of public and private
    operators. This document is applicable to new installations of overhead contact
    line systems and for the complete renewal of existing overhead contact line systems.
    The European standard EN 50119 has served as a basis for the elaboration of this
    document. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) title modified;<br />\r\nb) requirements
    for urban rail systems are included;<br />\r\nc) requirements for rigid overhead
    contact line (ROCL) are included;<br />\r\nd) additional definitions for new terms
    are included (Clause 3);<br />\r\ne) clearances and geometry of overhead contact
    line are improved (Clause 5);<br />\r\nf) urban aspects are added, for example
    wall anchors (Clause 6);<br />\r\ng) requirements for monitoring devices, automatic
    earthing and short-circuiting equipment are included (Clause 7);<br />\r\nh) requirements
    for overhead contact line for electric vehicles with pantograph on electrified
    roads are added (Annex E)<br />\r\ni) improvements on the basis of EN 50119:2020
    and the questionnaire 9/2619A/Q"
