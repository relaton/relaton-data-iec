abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-17:2006 was developed in response to the need for a generic
    method for coding of text at very low bitrate as one of the multimedia components
    within an audiovisual presentation. ISO/IEC 14496-17:2006 allows for example subtitles
    and Karaoke song texts to be coded and transported as separate text streams at
    bitrates that are sufficently low for use in mobile services over IP. Target applications
    are in particular found in areas with severe transmission bandwidth constraints,
    such as mobile services over IP. However, services over broadband IP, over broadcast
    channels and over optical media may also benefit from the low bandwidth of ISO/IEC
    14496-17:2006 text streams.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14496-17:2006 specifies a text stream
    as a concatenation of text access units. A text access unit contains text information
    of a specific format. For each text stream, the format of the text information
    within the text access units is signalled. Each text access unit within a text
    stream is intended to be displayed at a specific instance in time. Note that ISO/IEC
    14496-17:2006 signals the format of the text contained in text access units, but
    that it does not contain any text format specification.</p><p>Within ISO/IEC 14496-17:2006,
    a particular instance of text streams are 3GPP text streams. Each text access
    unit contained in a 3GPP text stream carries 3GPP Timed Text data, as specified
    in 3GPP TS 26.245. For 3GPP text streams, ISO/IEC 14496-17:2006 defines a generic
    framing structure suitable for transport of 3GPP text streams across a variety
    of networks, such as RTP for transport over IP, and MPEG-2 Systems for use in
    media such as broadcast and optical discs.</p><p>The flexible framing structure
    for text streams, consisting of so-called TTUs (Timed Text Units), allows for
    easy and convenient adaptation to the various transport layers. By using TTUs,
    multiple small text access units can be aggregated into one transport packet,
    but TTUs can also be used to fragment large text access units across multiple
    transport packets, while providing a reasonable level of error resilience in case
    of packet loss or non-recoverable packet errors. For each transport layer, the
    most suitable TTU structure can be chosen. If so desired, the text access units
    can be re-partitioned into TTUs for most effective adaptation to other transport
    systems.</p>"
