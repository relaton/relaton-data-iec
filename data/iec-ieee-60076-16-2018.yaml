  content: "IEC/IEEE 60076-16:2018 applies to dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers
    for wind turbine step-up application having a winding with highest voltage for
    equipment up to and including 72,5 kV. This document applies to the transformer
    used to connect the wind turbine generator to the wind farm power collection system
    or adjacent distribution network and not the transformer used to connect several
    wind turbines to a distribution or transmission network. Transformers covered
    by this document comply with the relevant requirements prescribed in the IEC 60076
    standards or IEEE C57 standards. This second edition of IEC/IEEE 60076-16 cancels
    and replaces IEC 60076-16:2011, and constitutes a technical revision. The main
    changes with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n1) relationship
    between transformer rated power and the output current from the associated generator
    is introduced;<br />\r\n2) thermal correction of the effective cooling medium
    has been introduced;<br />\r\n3) testing regime has been strengthened to ensure
    transformers are suitable for the harsh electrical environment to which they are
    subjected.<br />\r\nKeywords: transformers for wind turbine applications"
