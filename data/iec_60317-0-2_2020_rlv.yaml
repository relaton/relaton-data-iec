    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60317-0-2:2020
    specifies the general requirements of enamelled rectangular copper winding wires.
    The range of nominal conductor dimensions is given in 4.1 and the relevant specification
    sheet. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- revision to Clause 2 to add new normative references for specifications
    for copper rods;<br />\r\n- revision to 3.1 to add a new definition for the term
    “bonding layer”;<br />\r\n- revision to 3.2.1 to the conditions specified for
    tests to be carried out;<br />\r\n- revision to 4.5 to add requirements for minimal,
    nomimal and maximal overall dimensions with a bonding layer;<br />\r\n- revision
    to Clause 5 to reference specifications for rectangular and square copper rod;<br
    />\r\n- revision to Clause 6 to take into account nominal proof strength;<br />\r\n-
    revision to 8.2 to the adherence test requirement;<br />\r\n- revision to Clause
    18 to make reference to the relevant specification sheet."
