    <p>ISO/IEC 24735:2009 provides a method for measuring digital copying productivity of digital copying devices and multifunctional devices with various copying modes. </p>
    <p>It is applicable to digital copying devices and multifunctional devices equipped with automatic document feeder and collating function. </p>
    <p>It is intended to be used for black and white (B&amp;W) as well as colour digital copying devices and multifunctional devices of any underlying marking technology. </p>
    <p>It allows comparison of the throughput copying rates for a machine operated in various available operating modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, 2-up, etc) and various available digital image processing configurations.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24735:2009 includes test files, test setup procedure, test procedure, and the reporting requirements for the digital copying productivity measurements.</p>
