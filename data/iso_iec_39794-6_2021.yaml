abstract:
- content: "This document specifies:<br />\r\n- generic extensible data interchange
    formats for the representation of iris image data: a tagged binary data format
    based on an extensible specification in ASN.1 and a textual data format based
    on an XML schema definition that are both capable of holding the same information,<br
    />\r\n- examples of data record contents,<br />\r\n- application specific requirements,
    recommendations, and best practices in data acquisition, and<br />\r\n- conformance
    test assertions and conformance test procedures applicable to this document.<br
    />\r\nThe iris image information is stored as:<br />\r\n- an array of intensity
    values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1, or<br />\r\n-
    an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC
    15444-1 that can be cropped around the iris, with the iris at the centre, and
    which can incorporate region-of-interest masking of non-iris regions.<br />\r\nThis
    document also specifies elements of conformance testing methodology, test assertions,
    and test procedures, as applicable to this document.<br />\r\nIt establishes:<br
    />\r\n- test assertions pertaining to the structure of the iris image data format,
    as specified in Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this document,<br />\r\n- test assertions
    pertaining to internal consistency by checking the types of values that may be
    contained within each field, and<br />\r\n- semantic test assertions.<br />\r\nThe
    conformance testing methodology specified in this document does not establish:<br
    />\r\n- tests of other characteristics of biometric products or other types of
    testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance, robustness, security),
    or<br />\r\n- tests of conformance of systems that do not produce data records
    conforming to the requirements of this document.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    establish:<br />\r\n- requirements on the optical specifications of cameras, or<br
    />\r\n- requirements on photometric properties of iris images, or<br />\r\n- requirements
    on enrolment processes, workflow and use of iris equipment."
