abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies:</p><p>— generic extensible data interchange
    formats for the representation of iris image data: a tagged binary data format
    based on an extensible specification in ASN.1 and a textual data format based
    on an XML schema definition that are both capable of holding the same information,</p><p>—
    examples of data record contents,</p><p>— application specific requirements, recommendations,
    and best practices in data acquisition, and</p><p>— conformance test assertions
    and conformance test procedures applicable to this document.</p><p>The iris image
    information is stored as:</p><p>— an array of intensity values optionally compressed
    with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1, or</p><p>— an array of intensity values
    optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1 that can be cropped
    around the iris, with the iris at the centre, and which can incorporate region-of-interest
    masking of non-iris regions.</p><p>This document also specifies elements of conformance
    testing methodology, test assertions, and test procedures, as applicable to this
    document.</p><p>It establishes:</p><p>— test assertions pertaining to the structure
    of the iris image data format, as specified in Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this document,</p><p>—
    test assertions pertaining to internal consistency by checking the types of values
    that may be contained within each field, and</p><p>— semantic test assertions.</p><p>The
    conformance testing methodology specified in this document does not establish:</p><p>—
    tests of other characteristics of biometric products or other types of testing
    of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance, robustness, security), or</p><p>—
    tests of conformance of systems that do not produce data records conforming to
    the requirements of this document.</p><p>This document does not establish:</p><p>—
    requirements on the optical specifications of cameras, or</p><p>— requirements
    on photometric properties of iris images, or</p><p>— requirements on enrolment
    processes, workflow and use of iris equipment.</p>"
