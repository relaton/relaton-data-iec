  content: "IEC PAS 63086-3-1:2023 specifies a method to evaluate the capability of
    portable household air cleaners to reduce the concentration and viability of key
    experimentally generated bioaerosols in a specified chamber.<br />\r\nIndoor air
    free of harmful microbes is important to the health of occupants. This is particularly
    relevant with regard to increased time spent indoors.<br />\r\nAir cleaners are
    used to reduce the concentrations of microorganisms in indoor air.<br />\r\nThe
    efficiency of such air cleaners to reduce airborne microorganisms can be assessed
    in test chambers at controlled air temperature and relative air humidity.<br />\r\nThe
    test is applicable to portable air cleaners commonly used in single room spaces
    such as those based on mechanical filtration, ultraviolet (UV), ionizers, photocatalytic
    oxidation, and ozone generators in-unit technology.<br />\r\nIf the air cleaner
    does not claim to have the function of reducing microorganisms, this document
    may not be applicable unless it is being used to simply evaluate the performance.<br
    />\r\nThis document deals with measurement procedures regarding the reduction
    of the microbial contamination related to electrical air cleaner appliances for
    household and similar use.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to appliances
    intended to be used in medical, veterinary, or pharmaceutical applications.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not address sanitization, disinfection, or sterilization
    measures.<br />\r\nThis document does not support, by itself any health-related
    claims or conclusions about prevention or treatment of a disease or health improvement."
