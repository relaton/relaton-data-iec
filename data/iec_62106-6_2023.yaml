abstract:
- content: "IEC 62106-6:2023 contains the technical specifications for Open Data Applications
    in the public domain. This document is maintained by the RDS Forum Office. The
    RDS Forum Office applies an easy procedure for registering new Open Data Applications,
    to ensure that they can be used without the need to change the RDS standard. The
    ODA feature permits defining new applications that can be decoded on a receiver.
    The receiver needs to the adequate software handler for the specific AID, which
    identifies the application. Receivers that have not implemented the software handler
    needed for decoding are not affected by ODA data received for any of the applications
    already defined and specified. The procedure for registering a new ODA is described
    in IEC 62106-3.<br />\r\nIEC 62106-6:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Annex E: coding of station logo;<br />\r\nb) Annex F: coding
    of slideshow;<br />\r\nc) Annex G: coding of internet connection;<br />\r\nd)
    Annex H: ODA tool â€“ RDS data stream NFM."
