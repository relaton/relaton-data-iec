  content: "IEC 62977-2-7:2024 specifies standard measuring conditions and measurement
    methods for determining the optical characteristics of tiled displays which consist
    of multiple display modules in order to form one screen. These methods apply to
    emissive and transmissive direct view flat displays that render real 2D images
    with all modules lying in the same plane. The methods are applicable in environments
    where the measuring conditions can be controlled, such as laboratory and production
    testing.<br />\r\nNOTE The measurement results are not specific values for the
    products. They can vary according to the measurement method and light measuring
    device (LMD) used in the calibration."
