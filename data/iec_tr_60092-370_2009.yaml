abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 60092-370:2009(E) Technical Report gives guidance and lays down
    the basic recommendations for the selection and installation of shipboard and
    offshore unit cables intended for electrical systems used in both essential and
    non-essential analogue or digital signal communication, transmission and control
    networks, including types suitable for high-frequency signals (i.e. signals with
    a frequency of more than 105 Hz). These cables are not suitable for direct connection
    to low impedance supplies. Where such cables are required, attention is drawn
    to IEC 60092-353.
