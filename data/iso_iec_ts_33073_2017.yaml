abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017:</p><p>- defines an integrated PRM and PAM that
    meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an
    assessment by providing indicators for guidance on the interpretation of the process
    purposes and outcomes and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020;</p><p>-
    provides guidance, by example, on the definition, selection and use of assessment
    indicators.</p><p>A PAM comprises a set of indicators of process performance and
    process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective
    evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings. The set of indicators included
    in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is not intended to be an all-inclusive set nor is it
    intended to be applicable in its entirety.</p><p>The PAM in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017
    is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select
    a model and associated documented process method for assessment (for either capability
    determination or process improvement). Additionally, it can be of use to developers
    of assessment models in the construction of their own model, by providing examples
    of good service management practices. It can be used by:</p><p>a) service providers
    to assess and improve a Quality Management System (QMS);</p><p>b) service providers
    to demonstrate their capability for the design, development, transition and delivery
    of services that fulfil Quality Management requirements.</p><p>Any PAM meeting
    the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning models for process assessment
    may be used for assessment. Different models and methods can be needed to address
    differing business needs. The assessment model in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is provided
    as an assessment model meeting all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC 33004.</p><p>NOTE<strong>Copyright
    release for the PAM:</strong> Users of ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 can freely reproduce
    the detailed descriptions contained in the assessment model as part of any tool
    or other material to support the performance of process assessments, so that it
    can be used for its intended purpose.</p>"
