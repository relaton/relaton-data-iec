abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017:<br />\r\n- defines an integrated PRM and PAM that
    meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an
    assessment by providing indicators for guidance on the interpretation of the process
    purposes and outcomes and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020;<br
    />\r\n- provides guidance, by example, on the definition, selection and use of
    assessment indicators.<br />\r\nA PAM comprises a set of indicators of process
    performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting
    the objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings. The set of
    indicators included in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is not intended to be an all-inclusive
    set nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety.<br />\r\nThe PAM in ISO/IEC
    TS 33073:2017 is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish
    to select a model and associated documented process method for assessment (for
    either capability determination or process improvement). Additionally, it can
    be of use to developers of assessment models in the construction of their own
    model, by providing examples of good service management practices. It can be used
    by:<br />\r\na) service providers to assess and improve a Quality Management System
    (QMS);<br />\r\nb) service providers to demonstrate their capability for the design,
    development, transition and delivery of services that fulfil Quality Management
    requirements.<br />\r\nAny PAM meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004
    concerning models for process assessment may be used for assessment. Different
    models and methods can be needed to address differing business needs. The assessment
    model in ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 is provided as an assessment model meeting all
    the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC 33004.<br />\r\nNOTE Copyright release for
    the PAM: Users of ISO/IEC TS 33073:2017 can freely reproduce the detailed descriptions
    contained in the assessment model as part of any tool or other material to support
    the performance of process assessments, so that it can be used for its intended
    purpose."
