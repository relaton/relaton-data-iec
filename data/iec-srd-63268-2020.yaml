  content: "IEC SRD 63268:2020(E) depicts a comprehensive standardization landscape
    of the interfaces between the main grid stakeholders and the grid users, grid
    users comprising DERs and Customer Premises.<br />\r\nThis document considers
    the main \"physical\" and \"logical\" interactions (i.e. through wires/functions
    – power and/or communication) between grid users and grid stakeholders, both from
    an electrical standpoint and from a data standpoint. Then for each interaction
    type, the document presents the standardization landscape.<br />\r\nThis document
    depicts, as well, the interactions between the grid stakeholders manipulating
    grid user related data, themselves. Effectively it appears that considering the
    sole landscape of the interfaces between the grid users and the grid would be
    very limited without considering the way the data attached to grid users are manipulated/managed
    within and between the different stakeholders holding these data. Providing a
    seamless vision of the management of these data is becoming of highest priority.<br
    />\r\nThe document focuses exclusively on Distribution grid users, excluding as
    such \"bulk generation\" grid users and \"transmission connected grid users\",
    the main reason being that the main breakthrough resulting from the introduction
    of distributed energy resources affects mostly the Distribution grid users.<br
    />\r\nThis document mostly focuses on establishing the standardization landscape
    for the considered domain, including the IEC entities involved in producing reports,
    technical specifications and standards related to it. From this assessment a first
    set of recommendations is issued related to the way IEC addresses this scope."
