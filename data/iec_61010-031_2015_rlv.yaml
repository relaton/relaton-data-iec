abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-031:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61010-031:2015 specifies
    safety requirements for hand-held and hand-manipulated probe assemblies of the
    types described below, and their related accessories. These probe assemblies are
    for direct electrical connection between a part and electrical test and measurement
    equipment. They may be fixed to the equipment or be detachable accessories for
    the equipment. It has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with
    IEC GUIDE 104. IEC 61010-031 is a stand-alone standard. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2002 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    changes from the first edition, as well as numerous other changes:<br />\r\na)
    Voltages above the levels of 30 V r.m.s., 42,4 V peak, or 60 V d.c. are deemed
    to be HAZARDOUS LIVE instead of 33 V r.m.s., 46,7 V peak, or 70 V d.c.<br />\r\nb)
    Servicing is now included within the scope.<br />\r\nc) Extended environmental
    conditions are included within the scope.<br />\r\nd) New terms have been defined.<br
    />\r\ne) Tests for REASONABLY FORESEEABLE MISUSE have been added, in particular
    for fuses.<br />\r\nf) Additional instruction requirements for probe assembly
    operation have been specified.<br />\r\ng) Limit values for ACCESSIBLE parts and
    for measurement of voltage and touch current have been modified.<br />\r\nh) SPACINGS
    requirements for mating of CONNECTORS have been modified.<br />\r\ni) PROBE TIPS
    and SPRING-LOADED CLIPS requirements have been modified. The PROTECTIVE FINGERGUARD
    replace the BARRIER with new requirements.<br />\r\nj) Insulation requirements
    (6.5) and test procedures (6.6.5) have been rewritten and aligned when relevant
    with Part 1. Specific requirements have been added for solid insulation and thin-film
    insulation.<br />\r\nk) The terminology for MEASUREMENT CATEGORY I has been replaced
    with the designation \"not RATED for measurements within MEASUREMENT CATEGORIES
    II, III, or IV\".<br />\r\nl) The flexing/pull test (6.7.4.3) has been partially
    rewritten.<br />\r\nm) Surface temperature limits (Clause 10) have been modified
    to conform to the limits of IEC Guide 117.<br />\r\nn) Requirements for resistance
    of PROBE WIRES to mechanical stresses have been added in Clause 12 and a new Annex
    D.<br />\r\no) Requirements have been added regarding the prevention of HAZARD
    from arc flash and short-circuits for SPRING-LOADED CLIPS.<br />\r\np) A new informative
    Annex E defines the dimension of the 4 mm banana CONNECTORS."
