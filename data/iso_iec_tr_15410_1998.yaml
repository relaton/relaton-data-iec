abstract:
- content: "<p>This Technical Report (TR) analyses the requirements for the standardization
    of networking functions to support</p><p>mobility within one or more Private Integrated
    Network Exchanges (PINXs) of a Private Integrated Services Network</p><p>(PISN).It
    covers both Wireless Terminal Mobility (WTM) and Private Personal Mobility (PPM).</p><p>WTM
    is a function that allows users of Wireless Terminals (WT) to make and receive
    calls at any compatible radio</p><p>access within the network. Standards for WTM
    should be independent of the access technology used to support the</p><p>WTs.</p><p>PPM
    enables users of a PISN to register at any suitable terminal (wired or wireless)
    within the network for the</p><p>making and/or receiving of calls.</p><p>This
    Technical Report covers the following subjects for both WTM and PPM:</p><p>- Registration
    procedures;</p><p>- Procedures for incoming and outgoing calls;</p><p>- Access
    security procedures (identification and authentication);</p><p>- Requirements
    for numbering, addressing and signalling;</p><p>- Requirements for management,
    administration and operation.</p>"
