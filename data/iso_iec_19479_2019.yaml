abstract:
- content: "This document defines a model for the recording and exchange of learner
    achievement information among student information systems (SIS) (also known as
    student management information systems), as well as the aggregation of information
    by third party suppliers.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document defines refinements
    to the learner mobility achievement award (LMAI) model for representing the digital
    diploma supplement (DDS).<br />\r\nNOTE The proposed model proposed is not intended
    to define the representation of the entire spectrum of learner mobility information
    but to define the formally structured representation of official, institutionally
    attested achievement information for learners engaged in formal learning processes,
    in order to facilitate its recording and subsequent exchange within any international
    area within which learner mobility is possible. Achievement information structured
    and presented in compliance with this document could, of course, be used for other
    purposes, for instance, to provide descriptions of achievement to enrich a learner-owned
    report in an e-portfolio. However, guidance on the document and the organisation
    of information for purposes other than the representation of formal achievement
    reports is outside the scope of this document."
