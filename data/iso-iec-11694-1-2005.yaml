    <p>ISO/IEC 11694-1:2005 is one of a series of International Standards defining the parameters for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage and interchange of digital data.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11694 recognizes the existence of different methods of recording and reading information on optical memory cards, the characteristics of which are specific to the recording method employed. ISO/IEC 11694-1:2005 is specific to optical memory cards using the linear recording method. It defines the physical characteristics and the extent of compliance with, addition to and/or deviation from the relevant base document ISO/IEC 11693.</p>
