  content: "<p>The purpose of this technical report is to describe a set of procedures
    for the consistent registration of value domains and their attributes in a registry.
    This technical report is not a data entry manual, but a user's guide for conceptualizing
    a value domain and its components for the purpose of consistently establishing
    good quality metadata. An organization may adapt and/or add to these procedures
    as necessary.</p>"
