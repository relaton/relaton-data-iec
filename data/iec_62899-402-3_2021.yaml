abstract:
- content: "IEC 62899-402-3:2021(E) specifies the optical measurement method for acquiring
    two-dimensional images of voids and obtaining the void-related attributes in the
    dried or cured printed patterns which are part of the electronic products in the
    field of printed electronics. The measurable voids using this document are limited
    to those that are distinguishable by the optical image measurement.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒIn
    this document, void means an imperfection of pattern observed from a two-dimensional
    (2D) top-view."
