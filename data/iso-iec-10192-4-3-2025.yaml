  content: "ISO/IEC 10192-4-3:2025 specifies messaging among user, interface and service
    objects in the HES gateway to enable interworking among home cluster systems and
    interoperability among the applications supported by these cluster systems, as
    well as a common user interface to these cluster-system applications. This common
    user interface provides input and output methods for user information exchange
    to access, monitor and control applications running on home cluster systems.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies messaging among the required service and interface
    modules from the interoperability standard necessary for interworking and incorporation
    of these modules in the HES gateway (ISO/IEC 15045 series)."
