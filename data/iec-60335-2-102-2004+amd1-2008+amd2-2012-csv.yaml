  content: "IEC 60335-2-102:2004+A1:2008+A2:2012 Deals with the safety of gas, oil
    and solid-fuel burning appliances having electrical connections, for household
    and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    appliances and 480 V for other appliances. The electrical safety and some other
    safety aspects of these appliances are also covered. All safety aspects are covered
    when the appliance also complies with the relevant standard for the fuel-burning
    appliance. If the appliance incorporates electric-heating sources, it also has
    to comply with the relevant part 2 of IEC 60335. Examples of appliances within
    the scope of this standard are: central heating boilers; commercial catering equipment;
    cooking appliances; laundry and cleaning appliances; room heaters; warm air heaters;
    water heaters. This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2004),
    its amendment 1 (2008) and its amendment 2 (2012). Therefore, no need to order
    amendments in addition to this publication.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/44013\">IEC
    60335-1:2010</a>."
