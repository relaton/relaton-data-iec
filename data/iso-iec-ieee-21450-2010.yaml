  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 21450:2010 provides a common basis for members of the
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 series of International Standards to be interoperable. It defines
    the functions that are to be performed by a transducer interface module (TIM)
    and the common characteristics for all devices that implement the TIM. It specifies
    the formats for Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS). It defines a set of
    commands to facilitate the setup and control of the TIM as well as reading and
    writing the data used by the system. Application programming interfaces (APIs)
    are defined to facilitate communications with the TIM and with applications.</p>"
