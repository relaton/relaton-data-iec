abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-58:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-58:2017
    deals with the safety of electrically operated dishwashing machines for washing
    plates, dishes, glassware, cutlery and similar articles, with or without means
    for water heating or drying, not intended for household use, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase
    and neutral and 480 V for other appliances. These appliances are used for example
    in restaurants, canteens, hospitals, and commercial enterprises such as bakeries,
    butcheries, etc. Examples of such appliances are conveyor dishwashers; batch dishwashers
    and brush machines. Requirements to avoid backsiphonage of non-potable water into
    the water mains are specified in Annex BB. The electrical part of appliances making
    use of other forms of energy is also within the scope of this standard. As far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by these
    types of appliances. Attention is drawn to the fact that for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    may be necessary. This standard does not apply to the following: appliances designed
    exclusively for industrial purposes, for example machines used in the food industry
    for cleaning receptacles that serve as packaging for final products (e.g. bottle-cleaning
    machines), and machines used in manufacturing processes; sterilizers and washer-disinfectors
    used to treat medical materials (IEC 61010-2-040); dishwashers that do not form
    one functional unit, for example where a transportation device transfers the load
    from one separate unit to another; separately driven transport devices not confined
    in the appliance; appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions
    prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour
    or gas). This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2002 including its Amendment 1 (2008) and its Amendment 2 (2015). This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: The text has been aligned
    with Edition 5.2 of Part 1; Requirements and tests for vertical-lift doors with
    and without a counterbalance system are clarified (20.103, 20.104); Some notes
    have been converted to normative text or deleted (7.15, 9, 10.1, 11.7, 15.3, 19.4,
    20.1, 20.102, 22.106, 22.107, 23.3). This part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established
    on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard The attention of National
    Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations
    may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of
    its publication.<br /><br />\r\nKey words: Dishwashing Machine, Safety, Commercial"
