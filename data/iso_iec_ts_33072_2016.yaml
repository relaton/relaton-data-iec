abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 33072:2016:<br />\r\n- defines a process assessment model (PA
    M) that meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance
    of an assessment of process capability by providing indicators for guidance on
    the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes as defined in ISO/IEC
    TS 33052 and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020;<br />\r\n- provides
    guidance, by example, on the definition, selection and use of assessment indicators.<br
    />\r\nA PAM comprises a set of indicators of process performance and process capability.
    The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective evidence that
    enables an assessor to assign ratings. The set of indicators included in ISO/IEC
    TS 33072:2016 is not intended to be an all-inclusive set nor is it intended to
    be applicable in its entirety.<br />\r\nThe PAM in ISO/IEC TS 33072:2016 is directed
    at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select a model, and
    associated documented process method, for assessment (for either capability determination
    or process improvement). Additionally it may be of use to developers of assessment
    models in the construction of their own model, by providing examples of good information
    security management practices. It can be used by:<br />\r\na) service providers
    to assess and improve an Information Security Management System (ISMS);<br />\r\nb)
    service providers to demonstrate their capability for the design, development,
    transition and delivery of services that fulfil information security management
    requirements.<br />\r\nAny PAM meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004
    concerning models for process assessment can be used for assessment. Different
    models and methods might be needed to address differing business needs. The assessment
    model in ISO/IEC TS 33072:2016 meets all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC
    33004.<br />\r\nNOTE Copyright release for the PAM: Users of ISO/IEC TS 33072:2016
    may reproduce subclauses 5.2 to 5.27, 6.2, B.2 and B.3 as part of any tool or
    other material to support the performance of process assessments so that it can
    be used for its intended purpose."
