abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 16963:2017 specifies an accelerated ageing test method for estimating
    the lifetime of the retrievability of information stored on recordable or rewritable
    optical disks.<br />\r\nThe method is based on the theoretical assumption that
    the lifetime of data recorded on an optical disk has a lognormal distribution.<br
    />\r\nDetailed testing is specified for the following formats: DVD-R/RW/RAM disks,
    +R/+RW disks, CD-R/RW disks and BD recordable/rewritable disks. The testing can
    be applied to additional optical-disk formats with substitution of the appropriate
    specifications and can also be updated by the committee in the future as required.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 16963:2017 includes:<br />\r\n- stress conditions:<br />\r\n    -
    Basic and Rigorous stress-conditions for testing and subsequent analysis using
    both the Eyring and Arrhenius methods;<br />\r\n- ambient storage conditions in
    which the lifetime of data stored on optical disk is estimated:<br />\r\n    -
    a Controlled storage-condition, Temp = 25 °C and RH = 50 %, representing full-time
    air conditioning. The Eyring method is used to estimate the lifetime under this
    storage condition;<br />\r\n    - a Harsh storage-condition, Temp = 30 °C and
    RH = 80 %, representing the most severe conditions in which users handle and store
    optical disks. The Arrhenius method is used to estimate the lifetime under this
    storage condition;<br />\r\n- a description of the evaluation system;<br />\r\n-
    procedures for specimen preparation and data acquisition;<br />\r\n- definitions
    and methods used in testing specific disk types;<br />\r\n- analysis of test results
    to determine the lifetime of stored data;<br />\r\n- a format for reporting the
    estimated lifetime of stored data.<br />\r\nThe methodology includes only the
    effects of temperature and relative humidity. It does not attempt to model degradation
    due to complex failure mechanism kinetics, nor does it test for exposure to light,
    corrosive gases, contaminants, handling, or variations in playback subsystems.
    Disks exposed to these additional sources of stress or higher levels of temperature
    and relative humidity are expected to experience shorter usable lifetime."
