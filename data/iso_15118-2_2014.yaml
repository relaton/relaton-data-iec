abstract:
- content: ISO 15118-2:2014 specifies the communication between battery electric vehicles
    (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV) and the Electric Vehicle Supply
    Equipment. The application layer message set defined in ISO 15118-2:2014 is designed
    to support the energy transfer from an EVSE to an EV. ISO 15118-1 contains additional
    use case elements describing the bidirectional energy transfer. The implementation
    of these use cases requires enhancements of the application layer message set
    defined herein. The purpose of ISO 15118-2:2014 is to detail the communication
    between an EV (BEV or a PHEV) and an EVSE. Aspects are specified to detect a vehicle
    in a communication network and enable an Internet Protocol (IP) based communication
    between EVCC and SECC. ISO 15118-2:2014 defines messages, data model, XML/EXI
    based data representation format, usage of V2GTP, TLS, TCP and IPv6. In addition,
    it describes how data link layer services can be accessed from a layer 3 perspective.
    The Data Link Layer and Physical Layer functionality is described in ISO 15118-3.
