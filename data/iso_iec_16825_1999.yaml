abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a case
    for use with 120 mm DVD-RAM disks as specified in</p><p>ISO/IEC 16824. This International
    Standard specifies three related, but different implementations of such cases,
    viz.</p><p><strong>Type 1</strong>Provides a case for a one-sided (Type 1S) or
    a two-sided (Type 2S) DVD-RAM disk such that the disk can</p><p>not be removed
    from the case. This case is reversible.</p><p><strong>Type 2</strong>Provides
    a case for a one-sided DVD-RAM disk (Type 1S) such that the disk may be removed
    from the</p><p>case. This case is not reversible.</p><p><strong>Type 3</strong>Provides
    a case into which a one-sided DVD-RAM disk (Type 1S) may be inserted, then used
    as a</p><p>cartridge. This case is not reversible.</p><p>This International Standard
    specifies</p><p>- the environments in which the cases are to be operated and stored;</p><p>-
    the dimensional and mechanical characteristics of the case, so as to provide mechanical
    interchangeability between data</p><p>processing systems;</p><p>This International
    Standard provides for mechanical interchange between optical disk drives. Together
    with 120 mm</p><p>DVD-RAM disks according to ISO/IEC 16824 and a standard for
    volume and file structure, it provides for full data</p><p>interchange between
    data processing systems.</p>"
