abstract:
- content: "IEC 61215-2:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61215-2:2021
    lays down requirements for the design qualification of terrestrial photovoltaic
    modules suitable for long-term operation in open-air climates. This document is
    intended to apply to all terrestrial flat plate module materials such as crystalline
    silicon module types as well as thin-film modules. The objective of this test
    sequence is to determine the electrical characteristics of the module and to show,
    as far as possible within reasonable constraints of cost and time, that the module
    is capable of withstanding prolonged exposure outdoors. This second edition of
    IEC 61215-2 cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61215-2 issued in 2016.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. Addition of cyclic (dynamic) mechanical load
    testing (MQT 20).<br />\r\nb. Addition of a test for detection of potential-induced
    degradation (MQT 21).<br />\r\nc. Addition of test methods required for bifacial
    PV modules.<br />\r\nd. Addition of test methods required for flexible modules.
    This includes the addition of the bending test (MQT 22).<br />\r\ne. Revision
    of simulator requirements to ensure uncertainty is both well-defined and minimized.<br
    />\r\nf. Correction to the hot spot endurance test, where the procedure for monolithically
    integrated (MLI) thin film technologies (MQT 09.2) previously included two sections
    describing a procedure only appropriate for silicon modules.<br />\r\ng. Selection
    of three diodes, rather than all, for testing in the bypass diode thermal test
    (MQT 18).<br />\r\nh. Removal of the nominal module operating test (NMOT), and
    associated test of performance at NMOT, from the IEC 61215 series."
