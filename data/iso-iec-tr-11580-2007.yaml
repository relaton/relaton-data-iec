    <p>ISO/IEC TR 11580:2007 defines a format for describing user interface objects, actions and attributes. It provides a basis for standardizing the names and properties of user interface objects, actions and attributes across multiple applications and platforms.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 11580:2007 contains guidance both on the standardization of user interface objects, actions and attributes and on the implementation of these objects, actions and attributes in any or all modalities. It is primarily intended for developers of standards, style guides and architectures involving user interface objects, actions and attributes. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 11580:2007 also provides software developers with a range of functionalities to be considered in the design of objects, actions and attributes within user interfaces.</p>
