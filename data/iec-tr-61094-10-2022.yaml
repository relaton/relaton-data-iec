  content: "IEC TR 61904-10:2022<br />\r\n- is applicable to laboratory standard microphones
    meeting the requirements of IEC 61094-1 and other types of measurement microphones,<br
    />\r\n- describes one possible absolute method for determining the complex pressure
    sensitivity, based on a device capable of generating a known sound pressure, especially
    at low frequencies, and<br />\r\n- provides a reproducible and accurate basis
    for the measurement of sound pressure at low frequencies.<br />\r\nAll quantities
    are expressed in SI units."
