abstract:
- content: "This document supports the interest of information developers and associated
    roles responsible for producing information for users of software and systems
    developed within an agile environment. This document takes a process standard
    approach to specify the way in which information for users can be developed in
    agile development projects.<br />\r\nThis document provides requirements of information
    management and information development processes appropriate for software projects
    that are using agile development methods.<br />\r\nClause 5 covers the overall
    requirements for information in agile software development.<br />\r\nClause 6
    covers requirements for the information development lead or project manager to
    plan an agile information development project and manage the information development
    activities in an agile environment.<br />\r\nClause 7 covers requirements for
    designing, developing, and providing information for users in an agile environment.<br
    />\r\nAnnex A describes agile development practices and methods.<br />\r\nThis
    document is intended neither to encourage nor to discourage the use of any particular
    agile development tools or methods.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance on
    processes appropriate for information developers of information for users in software
    and systems projects that are using agile development methodologies. It is not
    limited to the development phase of the life cycle of information for users, but
    includes activities throughout the whole life cycle.<br />\r\nThis document is
    intended for use in all organizations that are using agile development or are
    considering implementing their projects using these techniques. It is assumed
    that users of this document have experience or general knowledge of information
    for users (traditionally called \"user documentation\") and agile processes."
