abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document supports the interest
    of information developers and associated roles responsible for producing information
    for users of software and systems developed within an agile environment. This
    document takes a process standard approach to specify the way in which information
    for users can be developed in agile development projects.</p><p>This document
    provides requirements of information management and information development processes
    appropriate for software projects that are using agile development methods.</p><p>Clause
    5 covers the overall requirements for information in agile software development.</p><p>Clause
    6 covers requirements for the information development lead or project manager
    to plan an agile information development project and manage the information development
    activities in an agile environment.</p><p>Clause 7 covers requirements for designing,
    developing, and providing information for users in an agile environment.</p><p>Annex
    A describes agile development practices and methods.</p><p>This document is intended
    neither to encourage nor to discourage the use of any particular agile development
    tools or methods.</p><p>This document provides guidance on processes appropriate
    for information developers of information for users in software and systems projects
    that are using agile development methodologies. It is not limited to the development
    phase of the life cycle of information for users, but includes activities throughout
    the whole life cycle.</p><p>This document is intended for use in all organizations
    that are using agile development or are considering implementing their projects
    using these techniques. It is assumed that users of this document have experience
    or general knowledge of information for users (traditionally called "user documentation")
    and agile processes.</p>
