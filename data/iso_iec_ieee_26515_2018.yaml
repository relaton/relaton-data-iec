abstract:
- content: <p>This document supports the interest of information developers and associated
    roles responsible for producing information for users of software and systems
    developed within an agile environment. This document takes a process standard
    approach to specify the way in which information for users can be developed in
    agile development projects.</p><p>This document provides requirements of information
    management and information development processes appropriate for software projects
    that are using agile development methods.</p><p>Clause 5 covers the overall requirements
    for information in agile software development.</p><p>Clause 6 covers requirements
    for the information development lead or project manager to plan an agile information
    development project and manage the information development activities in an agile
    environment.</p><p>Clause 7 covers requirements for designing, developing, and
    providing information for users in an agile environment.</p><p>Annex A describes
    agile development practices and methods.</p><p>This document is intended neither
    to encourage nor to discourage the use of any particular agile development tools
    or methods.</p><p>This document provides guidance on processes appropriate for
    information developers of information for users in software and systems projects
    that are using agile development methodologies. It is not limited to the development
    phase of the life cycle of information for users, but includes activities throughout
    the whole life cycle.</p><p>This document is intended for use in all organizations
    that are using agile development or are considering implementing their projects
    using these techniques. It is assumed that users of this document have experience
    or general knowledge of information for users (traditionally called "user documentation")
    and agile processes.</p>
