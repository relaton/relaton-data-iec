abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document describes the history and purpose
    of biometrics, the various biometric technologies in general use today (for example,
    fingerprint recognition, face recognition and iris recognition) and the architecture
    of the systems and the system processes that allow automated recognition using
    those technologies. It provides information on the application of biometrics in
    various business domains, such as border management, law enforcement and driver
    licencing. It also provides information on the societal and jurisdictional considerations
    that are typically taken into account in biometric systems.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Additionally,
    this document provides guidance on the use of the International Standards that
    underpin the use of biometric recognition systems.</p>
