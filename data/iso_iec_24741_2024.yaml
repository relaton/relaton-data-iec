abstract:
- content: "This document describes the history and purpose of biometrics, the various
    biometric technologies in general use today (for example, fingerprint recognition,
    face recognition and iris recognition) and the architecture of the systems and
    the system processes that allow automated recognition using those technologies.
    It provides information on the application of biometrics in various business domains,
    such as border management, law enforcement and driver licencing. It also provides
    information on the societal and jurisdictional considerations that are typically
    taken into account in biometric systems.<br />\r\nAdditionally, this document
    provides guidance on the use of the International Standards that underpin the
    use of biometric recognition systems."
