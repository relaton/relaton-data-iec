- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29794-1:2016, for any or all biometric sample types as necessary,
    establishes the following:</p><p>- terms and definitions that are useful in the
    specification and use of quality metrics;</p><p>- purpose and interpretation of
    biometric quality scores;</p><p>- encoding of quality data fields in biometric
    data interchange formats;</p><p>- methods for developing biometric sample datasets
    for the purpose of quality score normalisation;</p><p>- format for exchange of
    quality algorithm results;</p><p>- methods for aggregation of quality scores.</p><p>The
