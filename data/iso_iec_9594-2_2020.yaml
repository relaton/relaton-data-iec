abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a conceptual and terminological framework for
    the other ITU-T X.500-series Recommendations | parts of ISO/IEC 9594 which define
    various aspects of the Directory.</p><p>The functional and administrative authority
    models define ways in which the Directory can be distributed, both functionally
    and administratively. Generic Directory System Agent (DSA) and DSA information
    models and an Operational Framework are also provided to support Directory distribution.</p><p>The
    generic Directory Information Models describe the logical structure of the Directory
    Information Base (DIB) from the perspective of Directory and Administrative Users.
    In these models, the fact that the Directory is distributed, rather than centralized,
    is not visible.</p><p>This Recommendation | International Standard provides a
    specialization of the generic Directory Information Models to support Directory
    Schema administration.</p><p>The other ITU-T Recommendations in the X.500 series
    | parts of ISO/IEC 9594 make use of the concepts defined in this Recommendation
    | International Standard to define specializations of the generic information
    and DSA models to provide specific information, DSA and operational models supporting
    particular directory capabilities (e.g., Replication):</p><p>a) the service provided
    by the Directory is described (in Rec. ITU-T X.511 | ISO/IEC 9594-3) in terms
    of the concepts of the information framework: this allows the service provided
    to be somewhat independent of the physical distribution of the DIB;</p><p>b) the
    distributed operation of the Directory is specified (in Rec. ITU-T X.518 | ISO/IEC
    9594-4) so as to provide that service, and therefore maintain that logical information
    structure, given that the DIB is in fact highly distributed;</p><p>c) replication
    capabilities offered by the component parts of the Directory to improve overall
    Directory performance are specified (in Rec. ITU-T X.525 | ISO/IEC 9594-9).</p><p>The
    security model establishes a framework for the specification of access control
    mechanisms. It provides a mechanism for identifying the access control scheme
    in effect in a particular portion of the Directory Information Tree (DIT), and
    it defines three flexible, specific access control schemes which are suitable
    for a wide variety of applications and styles of use. The security model also
    provides a framework for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of directory
    operations using mechanisms such as encryption and digital signatures. This makes
    use of the framework for authentication defined in Rec. ITU-T X.509 | ISO/IEC
    9594-8 as well as generic upper layers security tools defined in Rec. ITU-T X.830
    | ISO/IEC 11586-1.</p><p>DSA models establish a framework for the specification
    of the operation of the components of the Directory. Specifically:</p><p>a) the
    Directory functional model describes how the Directory is manifested as a set
    of one or more components, each being a DSA;</p><p>b) the Directory distribution
    model describes the principals according to which the DIB entries and entryâ€‘copies
    may be distributed among DSAs;</p><p>c) the DSA information model describes the
    structure of the Directory user and operational information held in a DSA;</p><p>d)
    the DSA operational framework describes the means by which the definition of specific
    forms of cooperation between DSAs to achieve particular objectives (e.g., shadowing)
    is structured.</p>"
