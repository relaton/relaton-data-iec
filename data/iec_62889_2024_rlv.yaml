    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62889:2024
    describes two serial digital interfaces, Gigabit Video InterFace (GVIF) and Gigabit
    Video InterFace2 (GVIF2), for the interconnection of digital video equipment.
    GVIF and GVIF2 are primarily intended to carry high-speed digital video data for
    general usage and are well suited for multimedia entertainment systems in a vehicle.
    This document specifies the physical layer of the interface, including transmission
    line characteristics and electrical characteristics of transmitters and receivers.
    Mechanical and physical specifications of connectors are not included. IEC 62889:2024
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Addition of
    a new technology interface, GVIF2."
