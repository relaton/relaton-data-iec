  content: "IEC 60364-4-44:2024 provides requirements for the safety of electrical
    installations in the event of voltage disturbances and electromagnetic disturbances
    generated for different specified reasons. The requirements of this document are
    not intended to apply to systems for distribution of energy to the public, or
    power generation and transmission for such systems (see the scope of IEC 60364-1)
    although such disturbances can be conducted into or between electrical installations
    via these supply systems. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2007, Amendment 1:2015 and Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the structure
    of the document has been updated in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part
    2:2021: the terms, definitions and symbols have been regrouped under a new Subclause
    440.3, the tables and figures have been renumbered;<br />\r\nb) Clause 443 has
    been amended to better introduce the DC SPD and to improve some of the wording."
