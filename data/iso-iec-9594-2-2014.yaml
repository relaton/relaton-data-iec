    <p>ISO/IEC 9594 has been produced to facilitate the interconnection of information processing systems to provide directory services. A set of such systems, together with the directory information that they hold, can be viewed as an integrated whole, called the Directory. The information held by the Directory, collectively known as the Directory Information Base (DIB), is typically used to facilitate communication between, with or about objects such as application entities, people, terminals and distribution lists.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9594-2:2014 provides a number of different models for the Directory as a framework for the other parts of ISO/IEC 9594. The models are the overall (functional) model; the administrative authority model, generic Directory Information Models providing Directory User and Administrative User views on Directory information, generic DSA (Directory System Agent) and DSA information models, an Operational Framework and a security model.</p>
