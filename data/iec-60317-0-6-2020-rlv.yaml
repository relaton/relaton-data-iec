  content: "IEC 60317-0-6:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60317-0-6:2020
    specifies the general requirements of glass-fibre wound resin or varnish impregnated,
    bare or enamelled, round copper winding wires. The range of nominal conductor
    diameters is given in the relevant specification sheet. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2001 and Amendment 1:2006. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision to
    3.3, Appearance;<br />\r\n- revision to Table 1, maximum overall diameter of grade
    1 wire over single-glass fibre covering for nominal conductor diameters 1,600
    mm - 5,000 mm;<br />\r\n- revision to Table 2, maximum overall diameter of grade
    1 wire over double-glass fibre covering for nominal conductor diameters 1,600
    mm - 5,000 mm;<br />\r\nclarification in Table 3 measurement of elongation as
    “minimum elongation %”."
