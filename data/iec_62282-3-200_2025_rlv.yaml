abstract:
- content: "IEC 62282-3-200:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62282-3-200:2025
    covers operational and environmental aspects of the stationary fuel cell power
    systems performance. The test methods apply as follows:<br />\r\n- power output
    under specified operating and transient conditions;<br />\r\n- electrical and
    heat recovery efficiency under specified operating conditions;<br />\r\n- environmental
    characteristics, for example, exhaust gas emissions, noise, under specified operating
    and transient conditions.<br />\r\nThis document applies to all kinds of stationary
    fuel cell technologies, such as:<br />\r\n- alkaline fuel cells (AFC);<br />\r\n-
    phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFC);<br />\r\n- polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFC);<br
    />\r\n- molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC);<br />\r\n- solid oxide fuel cells
    (SOFC).<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2015. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of the Introduction, Scope
    and Clause 3;<br />\r\n- revision of the symbols in Table 1;<br />\r\n- revision
    of Figure 2 (symbol diagram);<br />\r\n- revision of measurement methods (8.3);<br
    />\r\n- revision of the efficiency test (10.2);<br />\r\n- revision of the electric
    power and thermal power response characteristics test (10.3);<br />\r\n- revision
    of the start-up and shutdown characteristics test (10.4);<br />\r\n- revision
    of Annex C."
