abstract:
- content: '<p>This Recommendation | International Standard describes the Open Distributed
    Management Architecture (ODMA). ODMA provides an architecture for the specification
    and development both of systems management as an open distributed application
    and of the management of open distributed applications. ODMA also provides the
    architectural framework for the development of the standards needed within the
    architecture. The management will be of a distributed nature; this implies:</p><p
    style="padding-left: 40px;">– distribution of the managing activity;<br />– management
    of distributed applications; and<br />– management of resources that may be distributed.</p><p>ODMA
    is compliant with the ODP-RM, so that in a distributed environment OSI Systems
    Management can be used in combination with other techniques that are engineered
    and implemented according to ODP principles.</p><p>This Recommendation | International
    Standard is the base document of a (potential) range of standards and Recommendations
    to be developed within ODMA. Figure 1 provides an overview of the relationship
    between this Recommendation | International Standard and other standards.</p><p>Other
    standards that may be developed within ODMA are:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">−
    ODMA supports: Based on the General Framework of ODMA, these standards give descriptions
    of specific systems support of ODMA. For example, the OSI Systems Management and
    CORBA support of ODMA have been identified.<br />− ODMA viewpoint notations: These
    component standards provide standardised notations for describing the ODP viewpoints
    for ODMA (see for example Annex D). These notations are described in separate
    documents for the ODMA viewpoint notations.<br />− ODMA functions: These component
    standards describe functions that are necessary for the construction of an Open
    Distributed Management System. Some example functions like the operation dispatcher
    function or the notification dispatcher function are outlined in this Recommendation
    | International Standard.<br />− ODMA inter-domain functions: These component
    standards describe the interworking between different paradigms providing support
    for ODMA, for example, between OSI Systems Management and CORBA.</p><p>As illustrated
    in Figure 1 this Recommendation | International Standard only elaborates a subset
    of supporting ODMA systems but allows for developments of other clauses. As a
    consequence, this Recommendation | International Standard consists of two sections:</p><p
    style="padding-left: 40px;">1) General Framework</p><p style="padding-left: 80px;">This
    clause describes ODMA as a specific interpretation of the Reference Model of Open
    Distributed Processing for the purpose of management. It introduces general terms
    that are needed for open distributed management. It may also identify tools for
    the description of the open distributed management applications.</p><p style="padding-left:
    40px;">2) OSI management support for ODMA</p><p style="padding-left: 80px;">This
    clause describes the OSI management support for ODMA. It relates the current OSI
    systems management concepts to ODMA concepts. However, it extends the current
    systems management standards to support the distribution of the management activities
    and the distribution of resources to be managed. As this specific interpretation
    reflects the current OSI standards, limitations may be imposed. For instance,
    only a number of distribution transparencies may be supported by the (extended)
    OSI management mechanisms.</p>'
