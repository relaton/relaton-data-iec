abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29167-10:2017 specifies the crypto suite for AES-128 for the ISO/IEC
    18000 air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices.
    Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices
    that might be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and application
    standards.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29167-10:2017 specifies a crypto suite for AES-128
    for an air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite is defined in alignment
    with existing air interfaces.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29167-10:2017 specifies various
    authentication methods and methods of use for the encryption algorithm. A Tag
    and an Interrogator can support one, a subset, or all of the specified options,
    clearly stating what is supported."
