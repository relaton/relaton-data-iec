abstract:
- content: "The purpose of the ISO&#x2F;IEC 29182 series is to\r\n- provide guidance
    to facilitate the design and development of sensor networks,\r\n- improve interoperability
    of sensor networks, and\r\n- make sensor network components plug-and-play, so
    that it becomes fairly easy to add&#x2F;remove sensor nodes to&#x2F;from an existing
    sensor network.\r\nISO&#x2F;IEC 29182-4 presents models for the entities that
    enable sensor network applications and services according to the Sensor Network
    Reference Architecture (SNRA)."
