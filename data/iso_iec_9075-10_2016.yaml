abstract:
- content: '<p>ISO/IEC 9075-2 speciﬁes embedded SQL for the programming languages:
    Ada, C, COBOL, Fortran, MUMPS, Pascal, and PL/I. ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016 deﬁnes similar
    features of Database language SQL that support embedding of SQL-statements into
    programs written in the Java? programming language (Java is a registered trademark
    of Sun Microsystems, Inc.). The embedding of SQL into Java is commonly known as
    "SQLJ". This part of ISO/IEC 9075 speciﬁes the syntax and semantics of SQLJ, as
    well as mechanisms to ensure binary portability of resulting SQLJ applications.
    In addition, it speciﬁes a number of Java packages and their contained classes
    (including methods).</p><p>Throughout ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016, the terms "SQLJ" and
    "SQL/OLB" are used synonymously.</p><p>NOTE Additional explanatory material (non-normative)
    about certain facilities defined in ISO/IEC 9075-2 can be found in ISO/IEC TR
    19075-3.</p>'
