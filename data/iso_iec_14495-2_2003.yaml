abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14495-2:2003 defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and nearly
    lossless (where the error for each reconstructed sample is bounded by a predefined
    value) compression methods for coding continuous-tone (including bi-level), gray-scale,
    or colour digital still images.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 14495-2:2003:<br />\r\nspecifies
    extensions (including arithmetic coding, extension of near lossless coding, extension
    of prediction and extension of Golomb coding) to processes for converting source
    image data to compressed image data;<br />\r\nspecifies extensions to processes
    for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data including an
    extension for sample tranformation for inverse colour transforms;<br />\r\nspecifies
    coded representations for compressed image data;<br />\r\nprovides guidance on
    how to implement these processes in practice."
