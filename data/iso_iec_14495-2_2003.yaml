abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 14495-2:2003 defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and nearly
    lossless (where the error for each reconstructed sample is bounded by a predefined
    value) compression methods for coding continuous-tone (including bi-level), gray-scale,
    or colour digital still images.   ISO/IEC 14495-2:2003:    specifies extensions
    (including arithmetic coding, extension of near lossless coding, extension of
    prediction and extension of Golomb coding) to processes for converting source
    image data to compressed image data;  specifies extensions to processes for converting
    compressed image data to reconstructed image data including an extension for sample
    tranformation for inverse colour transforms;  specifies coded representations
    for compressed image data;  provides guidance on how to implement these processes
    in practice.'
