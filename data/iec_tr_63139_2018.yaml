abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63139:2018(E) is related to the insulation coordination in TC 34
    standards and provides explanations on mathematical addition of working voltages,
    insulation between circuits, use of protective extra low voltage (PELV) and insulation
    between LV supply and control line conductors in order to cover new technologies
    associated with the use of LED light sources and controllable products.<br />\r\nIt
    describes in which way the addition of supply voltages and working voltages can
    be arranged for an assessment of the electrical insulation requirements (e.g.
    creepage distances and clearances) in a system if a first failure occurs."
