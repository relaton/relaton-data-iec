    <p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of a magnetic tape cartridge, using a magnetic</p>
    <p>tape 12,7 mm wide, so as to provide physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the</p>
    <p>recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format known as Parallel Serpentine, thereby allowing data</p>
    <p>interchange between drives by means of such cartridges. The format supports variable length Logical Records, high speed</p>
    <p>search, and the use of the algorithm for data compression specified in International Standard ISO/IEC 15200.</p>
    <p>Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the</p>
    <p>interchange code(s) and the specification of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p>
    <p>Together with a standard for volume and file structure, e.g. International Standard ISO 1001, this International Standard</p>
    <p>provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
