abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24759:2008 specifies the methods to be used by testing laboratories
    to test whether a cryptographic module conforms to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 19790:2006. The methods are developed to provide a high degree of objectivity
    during the testing process and to ensure consistency across the testing laboratories.
    Within each subclause of the security requirements clause of ISO/IEC 24759:2008,
    the corresponding security requirements from ISO/IEC 19790:2006 are divided into
    a set of assertions (i.e. statements that have to be true for the module to satisfy
    the requirement of a given area at a given level). All of the assertions are direct
    quotations from ISO/IEC 19790:2006.</p><p>Following each assertion is a set of
    requirements levied on the vendor. These specify the types of documentation or
    explicit information that the vendor is required to provide in order for the tester
    to verify conformance to the given assertion.</p><p>Also following each assertion
    and the requirements levied on the vendor is a set of requirements levied on the
    tester of the cryptographic module. These specify what the tester needs to do
    in order to test the cryptographic module with respect to the given assertion.</p><p>Vendors
    can use ISO/IEC 24759:2008 as guidance in trying to verify whether their cryptographic
    modules satisfy the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2006 before they apply
    to the testing laboratory for testing.</p>"
