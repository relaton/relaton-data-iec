  content: "IEC 62047-38:2021(E) specifies a test method for measuring the adhesion
    strength of metal powder paste in the electrical interconnection between micro-electromechanical
    systems (MEMS) and a circuit board. The typical examples of metal powder paste
    are anisotropic conductive paste, solder paste, and nanoscale metallic inks. This
    testing method is valid for metal powder diameters from 10 µm and 500 µm.<br />\r\nIn
    this test method, a uniaxial compression load is applied to metal powder paste
    using a glass lens simulating an actual MEMS device; then, the adhesion strength
    is measured by retracting the lens. This test method is proper when the adhesion
    strength should be analyzed by considering the actual contact area between the
    MEMS device and metal powder particles."
