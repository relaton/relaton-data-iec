abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-106:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-106:2021
    deals with the safety of<br />\r\n- portable heated carpets;<br />\r\n- heated
    carpets and similar appliances;<br />\r\n- heating units to heat the room in which
    they are located and that are intended to be installed directly under materials
    used as a removable floor covering such as carpet, cushion vinyl, or loose laid
    laminate,<br />\r\ntheir rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    installations and 480 V for other installations, including direct current (DC)
    supplied appliances.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- in
    many countries different wiring rules apply;<br />\r\n- for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national authorities for fire protection, the national authorities for
    building regulations, the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- blankets, pads and similar flexible heating
    appliances (IEC 60335-2-17);<br />\r\n- heated mats and foot warmers with an area
    not exceeding 0,5 m2 (IEC 60335-2-81);<br />\r\n- flexible sheet heating systems
    permanently incorporated in the floor of the building structure (IEC 60335-2-96);<br
    />\r\n- flexible heating elements incorporated in other appliances;<br />\r\n-
    battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 5.3,
    5.6, 7.12.1, 7.101, 10.1, 18.101.1, 18.101.2, 18.102.5, 19.1, 19.103, 21.1, 21.104,
    21.105, 30.102);<br />\r\nc) requirements for portable heated carpets have been
    added (Clause 1, 5.2, 5.5, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.14, 7.101, 11.8, 15.1,
    15.101, 16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 19.101, 19.102. 19.103, 21.105, 21.106, 24.1.5, 24.2,
    29.3);<br />\r\nd) requirements for washable portable heated carpets have been
    added (5.3, 7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.14);<br />\r\ne) the test of 30.102 has been updated.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
