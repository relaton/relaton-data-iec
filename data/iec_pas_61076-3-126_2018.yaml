    uses the general function principles of the push-pull connector housing system
    described in IEC 61076-3-117 with IP65/IP67 degree of protection according to
    IEC 60529 for harsh applications.<br />\r\nMale connectors have 5 square 1 mm
    electric contacts, with 16 A rated current. Connectors according this document
    are without breaking capacity COC according to IEC 61984, therefore they are not
    intended to be engaged or disengaged in normal use when live or under load, if
    not otherwise specified by the manufacturer."
