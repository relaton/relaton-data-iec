  content: IEC TR 62689-100:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, was prepared jointly
    with TC 57 with the scope to prepare requirements and proposals for the IEC 61850
    series data model extensions to support fault passage indicators (all classes
    and extended functions) applications to be introduced in the future IEC 61850-90-6
    and that, in turn, will be needed for the preparation of the future IEC 62689-3.
