  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-18:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">functional
    groups</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nfor functionalized graphene-based material and graphene
    oxide by\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">thermogravimetry analysis
    (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), referred to
    as TGA-FTIR.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe content of functional groups is derived by changes
    in mass of the sample as a function of temperature using TGA. Materials evolved
    during these mass changes are then analysed using coupled FTIR to identify functional
    groups.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">The functional groups
    determined according to this document will be listed as a key control characteristic
    in the blank detail specification for graphene IEC 62565-3-1 for graphene powder.</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">The method is applicable for functionalized graphene
    powder and graphene oxide that can be <span style=\"background-color:white\">pyrolysed</span>
    and gasified with elevated temperature during TGA.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Typical
    application areas are quality control for graphene manufacturers, and product
    selection for downstream users.</li>\r\n</ul>"
