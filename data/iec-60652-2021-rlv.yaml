  content: "IEC 60652:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and

    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60652:2021
    specifies the methods and procedures of testing supports for overhead lines. It
    applies to the testing of supports and structures of overhead lines. There is
    no restriction on the type of material used in the fabrication of the supports
    which may include, but not be limited to, metallic alloys, concrete, timber, laminated
    wood and composite materials. If required by the client, this document can also
    be applied to the testing of telecommunication supports, railway/tramway overhead
    electrification supports, electrical substation gantries, street lighting columns,
    wind turbine towers, ski-lift supports, etc. Tests on reduced scale models of
    supports are not covered by this document. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2002. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Title modified;<br />\r\nb) Added reference
    to CIGRE Brochure 399;<br />\r\nc) In Clause 7, added test limitation for wind
    speed and direction during testing;<br />\r\nd) In paragraph 10.5, added load
    increments for destruction tests;<br />\r\ne) In paragraph 10.7, added a requirement
    for an agreement between client and testing station when testing supports made
    of creep-sensitive materials;<br />\r\nf) In Clause 17, added requirements for
    sampling procedure to be provided in the test report."
