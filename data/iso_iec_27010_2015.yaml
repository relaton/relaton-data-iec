- content: ISO/IEC 27010:2015 provides guidelines in addition to the guidance given
    in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards for implementing information security
    management within information sharing communities.<p>This International Standard
    provides controls and guidance specifically relating to initiating, implementing,
    maintaining, and improving information security in inter-organizational and inter-sector
    communications. It provides guidelines and general principles on how the specified
    requirements can be met using established messaging and other technical methods.</p><p>This
    International Standard is applicable to all forms of exchange and sharing of sensitive
    information, both public and private, nationally and internationally, within the
    same industry or market sector or between sectors. In particular, it may be applicable
    to information exchanges and sharing relating to the provision, maintenance and
    protection of an organization's or nation state's critical infrastructure. It
    is designed to support the creation of trust when exchanging and sharing sensitive
    information, thereby encouraging the international growth of information sharing
    communities.</p>
