abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29172:2011 describes a reference architecture for Mobile AIDC
    (automatic identification and data capture) services. For example, a radio frequency
    identification (RFID) tag or a linear bar code or two-dimensional symbol called
    a \"data carrier\" is affixed to a movie poster; a Mobile RFID interrogator or
    a symbol capturing camera, i.e. a Mobile ORM reader, is built into a cell phone;
    an end-user aims or touches the cell phone to the data carrier on the movie poster;
    and the corresponding information content is retrieved via the network. This reference
    architecture does not restrict exploitation of other service architectures and
    aims at supporting the Mobile AIDC service models described in ISO/IEC TR 29172:2011.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29172:2011 includes<br />\r\n\tdescriptions of Mobile AIDC
    services,<br />\r\n\treference architecture and service components,<br />\r\n\tservice
    operation procedures, and<br />\r\n\trelationship among relevant standards to
    enable the reference architecture.<br /><br /><br />"
