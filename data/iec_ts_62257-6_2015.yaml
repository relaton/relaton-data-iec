abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-6:2015(E) describes the various rules to be applied for acceptance,
    operation, maintenance and replacement of decentralized rural electrification
    systems which are designed to supply electric power for sites which are not connected
    to a large interconnected system, or a national grid, in order to meet basic needs.
    This technical specification proposes a methodology to achieve the best technical
    and economic conditions for acceptance, operation, maintenance and replacement
    of equipment and complete system life cycle. The main technical changes with regard
    to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- redefine the maximum AC voltage
    from 500 V to 1 000 V, the maximum DC voltage from 750 V to 1 500 V;<br />\r\n-
    removal of the limitation of 100 kVA system size.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62257 series."
