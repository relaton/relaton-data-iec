    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62236-3-2:2018
    applies to emission and immunity aspects of EMC for electrical and electronic
    apparatus intended for use on railway rolling stock. IEC 62236‑3‑2 applies for
    the integration of apparatus on rolling stock. The objective of this document
    is to define limits and test methods for electromagnetic emissions and immunity
    test requirements in relation to conducted and radiated disturbances. This new
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition: clarification of certain parts of the standard; extension of
    emission and immunity requirements."
