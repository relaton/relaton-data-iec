  content: "IEC 62541-13:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62541-13:2020
    is part of the overall OPC Unified Architecture specification series and defines
    the information model associated with Aggregates. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition of IEC 62541-13, published in 2015. No technical
    changes but numerous clarifications. Also some corrections to the examples."
