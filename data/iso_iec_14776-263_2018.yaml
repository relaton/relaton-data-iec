abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-263:2018 The SCSI family of standards provides for many
    different transport protocols that define the rules for exchanging information
    between different SCSI devices. This document defines the rules for exchanging
    information between SCSI devices using a serial interconnect. Other SCSI transport
    protocol standards define the rules for exchanging information between SCSI devices
    using other interconnects.
