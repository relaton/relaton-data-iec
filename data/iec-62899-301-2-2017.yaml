  content: "IEC 62899-301-2:2017(E) defines measurement terms and methods related
    to the critical dimension of features and the registration accuracy of features
    on rigid plate masters.<br />\r\nGeneral critical dimensions are defined to evaluate
    the shape accuracy of features on the plate master. To evaluate the registration
    accuracy of features on the plate master, the specification for the registration
    mark for the plate master is specified. Then, common metrology procedures to measure
    the critical dimensions and the registration accuracy of the plate master are
    established for device manufacturers, printing master manufacturers and printing
    master manufacturing equipment vendors. The measurement terms which are measured
    by agreement between the user and the supplier are measured using the measurement
    methods given in this document."
