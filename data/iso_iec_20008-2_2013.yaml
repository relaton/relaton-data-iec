- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 20008-2:2013 specifies anonymous digital signature mechanisms, in which a verifier makes use of a group public key to verify a digital signature.
    It provides
    - a general description of an anonymous digital signature mechanism using a group public key;
    - a variety of mechanisms that provide such anonymous digital signatures.
    For each mechanism, ISO/IEC 20008-2:2013 specifies
    - the process for generating group member signature keys and a group public key;
    - the process for producing signatures;
    - the process for verifying signatures;
    - the process for opening signatures (if the mechanism supports opening);
    - the process for linking signatures (if the mechanism supports linking);
    - the process for revoking group members.
