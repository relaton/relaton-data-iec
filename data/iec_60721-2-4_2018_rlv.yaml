abstract:
- content: "IEC 60721-2-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60721-2-4:2018 presents
    a broad division into types of solar radiation areas. It is intended to be used
    as part of the background material when selecting appropriate severities of solar
    radiation for product applications. All types of geographical areas are covered,
    except areas with altitudes above 5 000 m. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 1987 and Amendment 1:1988. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Figures updated including
    the addition of global irradiation information<br />\r\n- Format updated.</p>"
