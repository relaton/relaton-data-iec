    <p>ISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to human-readable features (ISO/IEC 18013-1), machine-readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013‑2), and access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3). It creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL without impeding individual countries/states to apply their privacy rules and national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their specific needs.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18013-3:2009</p>
    <ul>
    <li>is based on the machine-readable data content specified in ISO/IEC 18013-2;</li>
    <li>specifies mechanisms and rules available to issuing authorities (IAs) for
    <ul>
    <li>access control (i.e. limiting access to the machine-readable data recorded on the IDL),</li>
    <li>document authentication (i.e. confirming that the document was issued by the claimed IA),</li>
    <li>data integrity validation (i.e. confirming that the data has not been changed since issuing).</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18013-3:2009 does not address issues related to the subsequent use of data obtained from the IDL, e.g. privacy issues.</p>
