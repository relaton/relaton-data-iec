  content: "IEC 60335-2-110:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-110:2024
    deals with the safety of microwave appliances intended for commercial use, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected
    between one phase and neutral and 480 V for other appliances.<br />\r\nAs far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by these
    types of appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances covered by this standard incorporate
    an open-ended applicator for treatment of the load. They are divided into three
    types:<br />\r\n- with insertion applicator, typically for moisture removal by
    insertion into holes in floors, walls or ceilings;<br />\r\n- with large area
    contacting applicator, typically for drying of floors, walls or ceilings;<br />\r\n-
    with small area contacting applicator, typically for paint removal and spot-heating.<br
    />\r\nMicrowave appliances with insertion applicator, large area contacting applicator
    or small area contacting applicator are using electromagnetic energy in one or
    several of the ISM frequency bands between 300 MHz and 30 GHz, for supplying energy
    to an external load which is heated so that a resulting process of drying, moisture
    transport which can result in forces due to formation of steam, decomposition
    or chemical modification, melting, or termination of organisms such as bacteria
    or fungus occurs.<br />\r\nAppliances with insertion applicator and with large
    area contacting applicator are portable appliances. Appliances with small area
    contacting applicator are handheld appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances that use non-electrical
    energy are within the scope of this standard. The microwave-related portion is
    considered motor-operated.<br />\r\nThe rationales for the microwave barrier and
    associated leakage tests are described in informative Annex AA.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- these appliances can radiate microwave energy
    outside a restricted area where they are used. The additional requirements specified
    by national authorities responsible for the protection for non-ionising radiation
    that the limit of power flux density is 10 W/m2, averaged over any time period
    of 6 min, outside this restricted area is taken into consideration in this standard;<br
    />\r\n- these appliances are intended to exclusively treat the load in normal
    operation, i.e. this standard does not apply to appliances or systems employing
    free space microwave propagation;<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used
    in tropical countries, special requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many
    countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    and national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and for non-ionising
    radiation protection.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- household
    microwave ovens, including combination microwave ovens (IEC 60335-2-25);<br />\r\n-
    commercial microwave ovens with a cavity door, commercial combination microwave
    ovens with a cavity door and commercial microwave ovens without a cavity door
    and with transportation means (IEC 60335-2-90);<br />\r\n- industrial microwave
    heating equipment (IEC 60519-6);<br />\r\n- appliances for medical purposes (IEC
    60601-1);<br />\r\n- appliances and equipment for laboratory use (IEC 61010 series);<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\nSome of the specifications and tests in this standard are not applicable
    for other than 2 450 MHz appliances.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2013 and Amendment 1:2019. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Subclause 7.1 has been improved in clarity.<br />\r\n- Subclauses 19.11.2 and
    19.103 have been improved in clarity.<br />\r\n- Clause 28 has been modified to
    add screw requirements.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
