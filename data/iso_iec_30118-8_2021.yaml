abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    30118-8:2021 This document provides detailed mapping information to provide equivalency
    between oneM2M defined Module Classes and OCF defined Resources.<br />\r\nA oneM2M
    Bridge is Asymmetric Client Bridge, therefore this document provides unidirectional
    mapping for Device Types (oneM2M Devices to OCF Devices), identifies equivalent
    OCF Resources for specific oneM2M Module Classes, and defines the detailed Property
    by Property mapping using OCF defined extensions to JSON schema to programmatically
    define the mappings."
