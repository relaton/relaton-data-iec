abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62862-1-2:2017(E) defines the procedures for the creation of annual
    solar radiation data sets (ASR) for solar thermal electricity (STE) plant simulation.
    This document defines procedures needed for the ASR construction as well as its
    components and parameters. The scope of application of this document refers to
    the needs associated with solar thermal power plant projects and mainly related
    to the simulation of an annual period with a solar radiation sum close to a normal
    annual value (from among an estimation of all possible annual values).
