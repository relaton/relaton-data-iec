abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-10:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60404-10:2016(E)
    is applicable to grain-oriented and non-oriented electrical steel strip and sheet
    for measurements of a.c. magnetic properties in the frequency range 400 Hz to
    10 000 Hz. The object of this document is to define the general principles and
    the technical details of the measurement of magnetic properties of electrical
    steel strip and sheet by means of an Epstein frame. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) adaption to modern measurement and evaluation methods, in particular
    the introduction of the widely spread digital sampling method for the acquisition
    and evaluation of the measured data;<br />\r\nb) introduction of formal changes
    which adapt this standard to other standards of the 60404 series;<br />\r\nc)
    revision of the problem of the air flux compensation taking account of the condition
    of the higher frequencies;<br />\r\nd) revision of the capacitive coupling of
    mutual inductor windings together with the consideration of the alternative method
    of numerical air flux compensation.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of
    March 2018 have been included in this copy."
