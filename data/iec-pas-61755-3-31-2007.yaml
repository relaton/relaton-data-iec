  content: This Publicly Available Specification is part of IEC 61755 and defines
    certain dimensional limits that an angled PC end-face multi-fibre rectangular
    ferrule having two guide-holes for positioning two alignment pins and using polyphenylene
    sulphide (PPS) material with a Young's modulus of less than 20 GPa has to meet
    in order to comply with specific requirements for interconnections.  Ferrules
    made from the material specified in this document are suitable for use in category
    C as defined in IEC 61753-1-1.
