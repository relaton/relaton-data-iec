abstract:
- content: "IEC 60445:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60445:2017
    applies to the identification and marking of terminals of electrical equipment
    such as resistors, fuses, relays, contactors, transformers, rotating machines
    and, wherever applicable, to combinations of such equipment (e.g. assemblies),
    and also applies to the identification of terminations of certain designated conductors.
    It also provides general rules for the use of certain colours or alphanumeric
    notations to identify conductors with the aim of avoiding ambiguity and ensuring
    safe operation. These conductor colours or alphanumeric notations are intended
    to be applied in cables or cores, busbars, electrical equipment and installations.
    This basic safety publication is primarily intended for use by technical committees
    in the preparation of standards in accordance with the principles laid down in
    IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a basic safety
    publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104. This sixth edition cancels and replaces
    the fifth edition of IEC 60445, published in 2010. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text of the introduction has been moved into the scope in accordance with
    IEC Guide 104;<br />\r\nb) colour codes for the identification of line conductors
    of DC systems;<br />\r\nc) colour code for the identification of functional earthing
    conductor;<br />\r\nd) update of Table A.1with colour codes for DC line conductors;<br
    />\r\ne) conversion of notes containing non-mandatory requirements to normative
    text;<br />\r\nf) the terminology is aligned with IEC 60050-195.<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of November 2017 have been included in this copy."
