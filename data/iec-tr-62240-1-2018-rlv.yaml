  content: "IEC TR 62240-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 62240-1:2018
    is a technical report, which provides information when using semiconductor devices
    in wider temperature ranges than those specified by the device manufacturer. The
    uprating solutions described herein are considered exceptions, when no reasonable
    alternatives are available; otherwise devices are utilized within the manufacturers’
    specifications. This document describes the methods and processes for implementing
    this special case of thermal uprating. All of the elements of these methods and
    processes employ existing, commonly used best engineering practices. No new or
    unique engineering knowledge is needed to follow these processes, only a rigorous
    application of the overall approach. The terms “uprating” and “thermal uprating”
    are being used increasingly in avionics industry discussions and meetings, and
    clear definitions are included in the present IEC Technical Report. They were
    coined as shorthand references to a special case of methods commonly used in selecting
    electronic components for circuit design. This new edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2013 and includes a revised wording for subclause
    4.1 (Introduction to selection provisions) and the associated flowchart."
