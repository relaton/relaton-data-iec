    IEC TS 62607-4-1:2014(E) provides a standardized method for the determination of electrochemical properties of lithium ion battery cathode nanomaterials to enable customers to decide whether or not a cathode nanomaterial is usable; and select a cathode nanomaterial suitable for their application. This technical specification includes<br />
    - definitions of terminology used in this document;<br />
    - recommendations for sample preparation;<br />
    - outlines of the experimental procedures used to measure cathode nanomaterial properties;<br />
    - methods of interpretation of results and discussion of data analysis;<br />
    - case studies; and<br />
    - references.<br />
    The future utilisation of renewable energy technologies depends significantly on the development of efficient systems for energy storage. Conventional approaches exist for the storage of electrical energy from stationary power plants, currently fuelled by many new ideas in conjunction with the emerging "smart grid". For future e-mobility for individual transportation there is only one attractive solution: a battery that can store enough energy to allow all-electric driving with a range of several hundred kilometres. The current solutions already on the market can only be regarded as temporary solutions. From today's perspective, lithium-ion batteries and their derivative innovative concepts must be regarded as the most promising candidates. Electrodes made from nanoscale composites will play a key role in the future. Innovative materials will be developed and systematically optimized, which implies testing of a large number of different materials. Characterization of the electrochemical properties of cathode nanomaterials used in lithium ion batteries is important for their customized development. This IEC technical specification provides a standard methodology which can be used to characterize the electrochemical properties of new cathode nanomaterials that will be employed in lithium ion batteries. Following this method will allow comparison of different types of cathode nanomaterial and comparison of the results of different research groups.
