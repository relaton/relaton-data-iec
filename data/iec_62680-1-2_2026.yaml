abstract:
- content: "IEC 62680-1-2:2026, the USB Power Delivery specification defines a power
    delivery system covering all elements of a USB system including USB Hosts, USB
    Devices, Hubs, Chargers and cable assemblies. This specification describes the
    architecture, protocols, power supply behavior, connectors and cabling necessary
    for managing power delivery over USB at up to 100W in SPR Mode and 240W in EPR
    Mode. This specification is intended to be fully compatible with and extend the
    existing USB infrastructure. It is intended that this specification will allow
    system OEMs, power supply and Peripheral developers adequate flexibility for product
    versatility and market differentiation without losing backwards compatibility.<br
    />\r\nIEC 62680-1-2:2026 cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in
    2024 and constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nExtended Power Range (EPR)
    including Adjustable Voltage Supply (AVS) has been added. This document is the
    USB-IF publication Universal Serial Bus Power Delivery Specification Revision
    3.2, Version 1.1."
