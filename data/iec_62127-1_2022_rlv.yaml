abstract:
- content: "IEC 62127-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62127-1:2022
    specifies methods of use of calibrated hydrophones for the measurement in liquids
    of acoustic fields generated by ultrasonic medical equipment including bandwidth
    criteria and calibration frequency range requirements in dependence on the spectral
    content of the fields to be characterized.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n-
    defines a group of acoustic parameters that can be measured on a physically sound
    basis;<br />\r\n- defines a second group of parameters that can be derived under
    certain assumptions from these measurements, and called derived intensity parameters;<br
    />\r\n- defines a measurement procedure that can be used for the determination
    of acoustic pressure parameters;<br />\r\n- defines the conditions under which
    the measurements of acoustic parameters can be made using calibrated hydrophones;<br
    />\r\n- defines procedures for correcting for limitations caused by the use of
    hydrophones with finite bandwidth and finite active element size, and for estimating
    the corresponding uncertainties.<br />\r\nIEC 62127-1:2022 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2007 and Amendment 1:2013. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) The upper
    frequency limit of 40 MHz has been removed.<br />\r\nb) Hydrophone sensitivity
    definitions have been changed to recognize sensitivities as complex-valued quantities.<br
    />\r\nc) Procedures and requirements for narrow-band approximation and broadband
    measurements have been modified; details on waveform deconvolution have been added.<br
    />\r\nd) Procedures for spatial averaging correction have been amended.<br />\r\ne)
    Annex D, Annex E and bibliography have been updated to support the changes of
    the normative parts."
