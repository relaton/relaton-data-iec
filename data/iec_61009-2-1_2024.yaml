abstract:
- content: "IEC 61009-2-1:2024 applies to residual current operated circuit-breakers
    with integral overcurrent protection for household and similar uses (hereafter
    referred to as RCBOs), classified according to IEC 61009-1:2024, 4.1.1. RCBOs
    according to this document are intended for voltages not exceeding 440 V AC with
    frequencies of 50 Hz, 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz and currents not exceeding 125 A and rated
    shortâ€‘circuit capacities not exceeding 25 000 A for operation at 50 Hz or 60 Hz.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    1991. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) harmonization of all clauses between the IEC 61008, IEC 61009 and IEC
    60755 series using blocks and modules approach;<br />\r\nb) harmonization of all
    tables and figures between the IEC 61008, IEC 61009 and IEC 60755 series;<br />\r\nc)
    terms and definitions are now referred to IEC 62873-2;<br />\r\nd) modification
    of Subclause 4.1 for classification according to supply conditions;<br />\r\ne)
    specific tests for operating characteristics (9.9) of RCBO according to classification
    4.1.1;<br />\r\nf) specific test conditions for temperature-rise (9.8), verification
    of trip-free (9.15), surge current tests (9.19), reliability (9.20) and ageing
    (9.21)."
