abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 13157-2:2010 specifies mechanisms for the Shared Secret Service
    (SSE) and the Secure Channel Service (SCH) in ISO/IEC 13157-1. It specifies cryptographic
    mechanisms that use the Elliptic Curves Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) protocol for key
    agreement and the AES algorithm for data encryption and integrity.ISO/IEC 13157-2:2010
    addresses secure communication of two NFC devices that do not share any common
    secret data ("keys") before they start communicating with each other.
