abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15444-3:2007 specifies the use of the wavelet-based JPEG 2000 codec
    for the coding and display of timed sequences of images (motion sequences), possibly
    combined with audio, and composed into an overall presentation. In this specification,
    a file format is defined, and guidelines for the use of the JPEG 2000 codec for
    motion sequences are supplied. ISO/IEC 15444-3:2007 also specifies profiles and
    the framework, concepts, methodology for testing and the criteria to be achieved
    to claim compliance to ISO/IEC 15444-3:2007.
