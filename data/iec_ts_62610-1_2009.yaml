abstract:
- content: "IEC/TS 62610-1:2009(E) provides guidelines for the installation of thermoelectrical
    cooling systems (Peltier effect) within cabinets ofthe IEC 60297 (19 inch) and
    IEC 60917 (25 mm) series. The cooling performance is in direct relation with the
    mounting location within a cabinet. Three typical mounting locations are identified:<br
    />\r\n1) cabinet with inside or outside mounted thermoelectrical cooling system
    for the cooling of a whole cabinet;<br />\r\n2) cabinet with top mounted thermoelectrical
    cooling system for the cooling of a whole cabinet;<br />\r\n3) cabinet with inbuilt
    thermoelectrical cooling system in form of a subrack for hot spot cooling."
