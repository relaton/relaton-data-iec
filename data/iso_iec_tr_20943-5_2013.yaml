- content: |-
    The purpose of ISO/IEC/TR 20943-5:2013 is to describe a procedure for establishing metadata crosswalks based on the ISO/IEC 11179 series, subsequently improving mapping quality between metadata.

    Therefore, ISO/IEC/TR 20943-5:2013 describes a metadata mapping procedure (MMP), which can maximize the interoperability among ISO/IEC 11179-based registries through achieving metadata registry content consistency.
