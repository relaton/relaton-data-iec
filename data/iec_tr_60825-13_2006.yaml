    This Technical Report provides manufacturers, test houses, safety personnel, and others with practical guidance on methods to perform radiometric measurements or analyses to establish the emission level of laser energy in accordance with IEC 60825-1 (herein referred to as "the standard"). The measurement procedures described in this technical report are intended as guidance for classification of laser products in accordance with, that standard. Other procedures are acceptable if they are better or more appropriate.

    Information is provided for calculating accessible emission limits (AELs) and maximum permissible exposures (MPEs), since some parameters used in calculating the limits are dependent upon other measured quantities.

    This document is intended to apply to lasers, including extended sources and laser arrays. Users of this document should be aware that the procedures described herein for extended source viewing conditions may yield more conservative results than when using more rigorous methods.
