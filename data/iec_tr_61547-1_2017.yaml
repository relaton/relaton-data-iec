abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61547-1:2017(E) describes an objective light flickermeter, which
    can be applied for, amongst others, the following purposes:<br />\r\n- testing
    the intrinsic performance of all lighting equipment without voltage fluctuations;<br
    />\r\n- testing the immunity performance of lighting equipment against (unintentional)
    voltage fluctuation disturbance on the AC power port;<br />\r\n- testing the immunity
    performance of lighting equipment against intentional voltage fluctuation on the
    AC power port arising for example from ripple control systems.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na.
    the title of Part 1 has been changed to reflect the more general application of
    the objective flickermeter;<br />\r\nb. the specific voltage fluctuation immunity
    test method has been extended for lighting equipment rated for 120 V AC and 230
    V AC, 50 Hz and 60 Hz."
