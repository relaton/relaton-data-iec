abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63200:2021(E), which is a Systems Reference Deliverable, defines
    the framework elements, associated ontology, and modelling methodology for designing
    the Smart energy Grid Reference Architecture using the Smart Grid Architecture
    Model (SGAM), with potential expansion to describe the interaction between the
    grid and heat/gas systems, and including easily understandable examples.<br />\r\nThis
    document also provides a machine level representation of the concepts associated
    with the SGAM in the form of an ontology provided in the form of diagrams in Annex
    A, as well as in the form of a code component. Thus, this document is associated
    with a code component presented as a ZIP file package."
