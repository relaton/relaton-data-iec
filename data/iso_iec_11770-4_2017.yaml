abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11770-4:2017 defines key establishment mechanisms based on weak
    secrets, i.e. secrets that can be readily memorized by a human, and hence, secrets
    that will be chosen from a relatively small set of possibilities. It specifies
    cryptographic techniques specifically designed to establish one or more secret
    keys based on a weak secret derived from a memorized password, while preventing
    offline brute-force attacks associated with the weak secret. ISO/IEC 11770-4:2017
    is not applicable to the following aspects of key management:<br />\r\n- life-cycle
    management of weak secrets, strong secrets, and established secret keys;<br />\r\n-
    mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy, etc. weak secrets, strong secrets,
    and established secret keys."
