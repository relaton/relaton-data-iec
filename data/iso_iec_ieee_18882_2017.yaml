abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 18882:2017 is based on the protocol defined in IEEE Std 1888?1,
    IEEE Standard for Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol, this standard
    extends component and data type definitions, message formats, and communication
    procedures for heterogeneous network convergence and scalability. This standard
    also describes heterogeneous networks interconnection issues and requirements.
    Also, this standard specifies system architecture and solutions to improve heterogeneous
    networks convergence and scalability while offering system robustness and supplying
    better performance in system operation and management.
