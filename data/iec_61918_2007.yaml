abstract:
- content: IEC 61918:2007 It specifies basic requirements for the installation of
    media for communication networks in industrial premises and within and between
    the automation islands, of industrial sites. This standard covers balanced and
    optical fibre cabling. It also covers the cabling infrastructure for wireless
    media, but not the wireless media itself. Additional media are covered in IEC
    61784-5 series. It provides guidelines that cope with the critical aspects of
    the industrial automation area (topologies, climatic conditions, vibrations, chemical
    pollution, EMC, functional safety, security, etc.). It deals with the roles of
    planner, installer, verifier, and acceptance test personnel, administration and
    maintenance personnel and specifies the relevant responsibilities and/or gives
    guidance. The contents of the corrigendum of February 2009 have been included
    in this copy.
