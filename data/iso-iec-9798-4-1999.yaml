    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 9798 specifies entity authentication mechanisms using a cryptographic check function. Two</p>
    <p>mechanisms are concerned with the authentication of a single entity (unilateral authentication), while the remaining</p>
    <p>are mechanisms for mutual authentication of two entities.</p>
    <p>The mechanisms specified in this part of ISO/IEC 9798 use time variant parameters such as time stamps,</p>
    <p>sequence numbers, or random numbers, to prevent valid authentication information from being accepted at a later</p>
    <p>time or more than once.</p>
    <p>If a time stamp or sequence number is used, one pass is needed for unilateral authentication, while two passes are</p>
    <p>needed to achieve mutual authentication. If a challenge and response method employing random numbers is</p>
    <p>used, two passes are needed for unilateral authentication, while three passes are required to achieve mutual</p>
    <p>authentication.</p>
    <p>Examples of cryptographic check functions are given in ISO/IEC 9797.</p>
