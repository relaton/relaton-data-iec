abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15944-20:2015 specifies the properties of Base Functional Specification
    View (FSV) Standards in order to best meet the requirements of the Business Operational
    View (BOV) with interoperable implementations. Base FSV standards exhibiting these
    properties support business transactions beyond those that are in compliance with
    Open-edi scenarios (OeS). Additional beneficial business transactions may also
    be supported between a given IT system and IT system(s) outside of the Open-edi
    scenarios for which they were designed.</p><p>These base FSV standards address
    those aspects of interoperability between IT systems used among Parties of the
    Open-edi Community participating in the scenario. Examples of such standards include
    the choreography of interchanges among systems, and the foundational structure
    and syntax used to express Information Bundles (IB) in the interchanges.</p>"
