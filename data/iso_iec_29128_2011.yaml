abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29128:2011 establishes a technical base for the security proof
    of the specification of cryptographic protocols. It specifies design evaluation
    criteria for these protocols, as well as methods to be applied in a verification
    process for such protocols. It also provides definitions of different protocol
    assurance levels consistent with evaluation assurance components in ISO/IEC 15408.
