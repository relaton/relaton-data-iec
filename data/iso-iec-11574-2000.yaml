    <p>This International Standard specifies the service description and control aspects, including functional capabilities and</p>
    <p>information flows, of standardised circuit-mode bearer services which may be supported by a Private Integrated Services</p>
    <p>Network (PISN).</p>
    <p>This International Standard includes the following basic services:</p>
    <p>_ Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s unrestricted 8 kHz structured bearer service category;</p>
    <p>_ Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s 8 kHz structured bearer service category usable for speech information transfer;</p>
    <p>_ Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s 8 kHz structured bearer service category usable for 3,1 kHz audio information transfer.</p>
    <p>A PISN shall support at least one of the above three bearer services to conform with this International Standard.</p>
    <p>The scope of this International Standard does not include:</p>
    <p>_ the negotiation of service at call establishment time,</p>
    <p>_ the change of service during a call, and</p>
    <p>_ unidirectional services.</p>
    <p>This International Standard includes optional procedures for the provision of functions equivalent to the following public ISDN</p>
    <p>supplementary services: Subaddress and Multiple Subscriber Number.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1 - Supplementary services and other bearer services which can be used in conjunction with 64 kbit/s circuit switched bearer services</p>
    <p>specified in this International Standard are dealt with in other standards.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2 - Service specifications are based on information concerning the corresponding public ISDN service available at the time of</p>
    <p>publication of this International Standard.</p>
    <p>NOTE 3 - ITU-T treat Subaddressing and Multiple Subscriber Number as supplementary services.</p>
    <p>NOTE 4 - The use of the Direct Dial In supplementary service of a public ISDN for calls incoming to a PISN from a public ISDN is regarded</p>
    <p>as part of the basic services in a PISN.</p>
    <p>NOTE 5 - The use of the Calling Line Identification Presentation and Connected Line Identification Presentation supplementary services of a</p>
    <p>public ISDN for obtaining the Originating Number or the Connected Number of a call from or to a public ISDN is regarded as part of the</p>
    <p>basic services in a PISN.</p>
    <p>NOTE 6 - The provision (either explicitly or implicitly) by the user to the network, of its own number (Originating Number or Connected</p>
    <p>Number), and the provision of an Originating Number or a Connected Number by a PISN to another network is a part of the basic services in</p>
    <p>a PISN and not a part of the Calling Line Identification Presentation and Connected Line Identification Presentation supplementary services.</p>
    <p>Those supplementary services are concerned only with the presentation of the number from the network to the served PISN user.</p>
