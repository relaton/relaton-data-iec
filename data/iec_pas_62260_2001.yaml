abstract:
- content: The test determines the regularity of impedance of RF-cables by measuring
    the return loss in the frequency domain using a vector network analyser equipped
    with a reflection test set (bridge) and transfer them into the time domain by
    using the Inverse Discrete Fourier Transformation (IDFT).
