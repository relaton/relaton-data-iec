abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-90-27:2023, which is a Technical Report, is to provide basic
    aspects that need to be considered when using IEC 61850 for information exchange
    between systems and components to support applications for thermal systems connected
    to electric power networks. Thermal systems isolated from electric power networks
    are outside the scope of this document.<br />\r\nFrom the perspective of category,
    this document considers thermal systems that provide thermal energy services for
    residential and/or commercial buildings and districts. In other words, industrial
    thermal systems are outside the scope of this document.<br />\r\nFrom the perspective
    of energy transformation, this document deals with ones between electricity and
    thermal energy. Other types of energy such as gas will be documented in a future
    report.<br />\r\nFrom the perspective of resource, this document considers generic
    aspects of thermal energy generators, storage, and loads that may contribute to
    the operations and management of electric power networks. It also deals with specific
    types of resources that have electric parts such as power to heat (P2H) that is
    a kind of electric load, and combined heat and power (CHP) that is an electric
    generator. This document models the characteristics for such specific units of
    resources including alarms and ratings. On the other hand, it does not deal with
    other types of specific units according to the scope of this document. For example,
    gas boilers, thermal energy tanks, heat exchangers, HVAC, auxiliary devices for
    thermal systems are not modelled as logical nodes in this document.<br />\r\nAs
    a summary, this document<br />\r\n- gives an overview of thermal energy resources
    connected to electric power networks.<br />\r\n- provides use cases for typical
    operations of thermal system and deducts exchanged information necessary for information
    modelling.<br />\r\n- provides mapping of requirements on LNs based on the use
    cases.<br />\r\n- defines generic logical nodes for resources in thermal systems.<br
    />\r\n- defines logical nodes for specific unit types of P2H and CHP.<br />\r\n-
    defines logical nodes for operations that may contribute to the operations of
    electric power networks."
