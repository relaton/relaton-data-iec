  content: "IEC 61914:2021 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61914:2021 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61914:2015
    edition 2.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 23A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61914:2021 specifies
    requirements and tests for cable cleats used for securing cables in electrical
    installations and for intermediate restraints used for holding cables together
    in formation in electrical installations. Cable cleats provide resistance to electromechanical
    forces where declared. This document includes cable cleats that rely on a mounting
    surface specified by the manufacturer for axial and/or lateral retention of cables.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\nrequirements for mandrels used in testing rationalised and detailed in the
    general test requirements (Clause 5);<br />\r\ndefinition of liner added and test
    requirements where liners and other optional parts are used;<br />\r\ndefinitions
    for LV, MV and HV cables added and test requirements where MV & HV cable are used
    ;<br />\r\nnew corrosion resistance classes for plated products added;<br />\r\nnew
    requirements and test for durability and legibility of markings added;<br />\r\nnew
    test requirements for axial load testing of cleats for more than one cable added;<br
    />\r\nlateral load test requirements for intermediate restraints added."
