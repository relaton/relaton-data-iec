  content: 'IEC TR 62690:2014 which is a technical report provides information concerning
    the behaviour of fibres and cables when exposed to hydrogen effects. The application
    of multimode fibres is very rarely subject to hydrogen effects. For that reason,
    this technical report only highlights the effects of hydrogen to single-mode fibres.
    Keywords: hydrogen effects, single-mode fibres'
