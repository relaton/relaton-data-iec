abstract:
- content: "IEC 60599:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60599:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60599:2015
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 10 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60599:2022 describes how the concentrations of dissolved gases
    or free gases can be interpreted to diagnose the condition of oil-filled electrical
    equipment in service and suggest future action. This document is applicable to
    electrical equipment filled with mineral insulating oil and insulated with cellulosic
    paper or pressboard-based solid insulation. Information about specific types of
    equipment such as transformers (power, instrument, industrial, railways, distribution),
    reactors, bushings, switchgear and oil-filled cables is given only as an indication
    in the application notes. This document can be applied, but only with caution,
    to other liquid-solid insulating systems. In any case, the indications obtained
    are given only as guidance with resulting action undertaken only with proper engineering
    judgment."
