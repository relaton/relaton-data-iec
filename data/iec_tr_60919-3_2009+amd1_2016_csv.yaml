abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60919-3:2009+A1:2016 provides general guidance on the dynamic performance
    of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. Dynamic performance is meant to
    include those events and phenomena whose characteristic frequencies or time domain
    cover the range between transient conditions and steady state. Diode valves are
    not considered in this specification. This report (IEC 60919-3) which covers dynamic
    performance, is accompanied by publications for steady-state (IEC 60919-1) and
    transient (IEC 60919-2) performance. All three aspects should be considered when
    preparing two-terminal HVDC system specifications. This report should not be used
    directly as a specification for a specific project, but rather to provide the
    basis for an appropriate specification tailored to fit actual system requirements
    for a particular electric power transmission scheme. This report does not intend
    to discriminate between the responsibility of users and manufacturers for the
    work specified. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, which
    was issued as a technical specification in 1999. It constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) this report concerns only line-commutated
    converters;<br />\r\nb) significant changes have been made to the control system
    technology;<br />\r\nc) some environmental constraints, for example audible noise
    limits, have been added;<br />\r\nd) the capacitor coupled converters (CCC) and
    controlled series capacitor converters (CSCC) have been included.<strong>This
    consolidated version consists of the second edition (2009) and its amendment 1
    (2016). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>"
