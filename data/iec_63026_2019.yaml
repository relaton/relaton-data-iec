abstract:
- content: "IEC 63026:2019 specifies test methods and requirements for power cable
    systems, cables with extruded insulation and their accessories for fixed submarine
    installations, for rated voltages from 6 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 7,2 kV)
    up to 60 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 72,5 kV).<br />\r\nThis document includes
    the electrical tests and the physical tests on materials and components as well
    as the specific mechanical tests that are applicable to submarine cable systems.<br
    />\r\nThe requirements apply to armoured single-core cables and three-core cables
    in combination with their accessories, terminations and joints for usual conditions
    of installation and operation, but not to special cables and their accessories,
    such as submarine cables for dynamic applications (i.e. for direct connection
    to a floating structure), for which modifications to the standard tests can be
    necessary or special test conditions be devised.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to submarine cables installed in permanently submerged conditions with water depths
    up to 250 m.<br />\r\nThis document does not include accessories having a mechanical
    function only, such as hang-offs or armour clamps."
