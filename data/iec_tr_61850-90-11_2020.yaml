abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-90-11:2020(E), which is a Technical Report, describes the
    methodologies for the modelling of logics for IEC 61850 based applications in
    power utility automation. In particular, it describes the functional view of logic
    based on existing logical nodes for generic process automation and the operational
    modes of the logic. Furthermore it includes the specification of the standard
    language to be applied to specific the logic as well as the related data exchange
    format between engineering tools and their application as well as the mapping
    of logic elements to IEC 61850 data types.<br />\r\nThe examples or use cases
    given in this document are based on the class model introduced in IEC 61850-7-1
    and defined in IEC 61850-7-3. The logical node and data names used in this document
    are defined in IEC 61850-7-4, the services applied in IEC 61850-7-2. The naming
    conventions of IEC 61850-7-2 are applied in this document also.<br />\r\nIf extensions
    are needed in the application examples, the normative naming rules for multiple
    instances and private, compatible extensions of Logical Node (LN) Classes and
    Data Object Names defined in IEC 61850-7-1 are considered.<br />\r\nThis document
    describes the use of IEC 61850 extensions for modelling logics, therefore it implies
    some tutorial material. However it is advisable to read IEC 61850-6 and IEC 61850-7-1
    in conjunction with IEC 61850-7-3 and IEC 61850-7-2 first and IEC 61131-3 as reference
    for the programming language of logic.<br />\r\nThe different logics included
    in any IED in an IEC 61850 based system can be classified into two groups:<br
    />\r\n• Fixed Logic: These logics are predefined mostly for critical and complex
    functions. They are typically included in the IED´s defined application, potentially
    implemented in software, firmware or hardware, and are not modifiable with IEC
    61850 tools and services. These logics are implementation specific. Fixed logic
    is out of the scope of this document.<br />\r\n• Editable Logic: These are user
    configurable / programmable logics which shall be modelled through IEC 61850 configuration
    tools and be accessible by IEC 61850 services. These logics can be application
    specific.<br />\r\nThe major goal of this document is to adopt the given functionality
    of an IED to fit to specific application function demands. This is to provide
    a definition of the methodology for describing and exchanging logics using an
    IEC 61850 compatible solution. As a benefit the same logic description will be
    valid and vendor-independent, so it could be used for different IEDs. It is up
    to the tools to understand this standard description in order to be able to manipulate
    the logics and to properly configure the IEDs.<br />\r\nGraphical representation
    of logic is currently out-of-scope of the IEC 61850 series, even if it is part
    of the PLCopen XML specification. The representation is subject to the engineering
    tools.<br />\r\nModelling logics requires some extension of the currently defined
    data model and / or an extension of the content in the SCL files which is described
    and which needs to be considered in later editions of IEC 61850-6 and IEC 61850-7-4."
