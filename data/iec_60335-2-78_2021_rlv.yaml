abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-78:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-78:2021
    deals with the safety of outdoor barbecues for household and similar use, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, restaurants, hotels,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used on board ships, additional
    requirements may be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- barbecues for indoor use (IEC 60335-2-9);<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended to burn charcoal or similar combustible fuels;<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to
    be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of
    a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2002, Amendment 1: 2008 and Amendment 2:2019. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text is
    aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative
    text (Clause 1, 5.2, 15.101, 22.102);<br />\r\nc) requirements for communal use
    barbecues have been added (Clause 3, 7.1, 22.103, 22.104);<br />\r\nd) exclusion
    of battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\ne) clarification of the need
    for an RCD is added (7.12).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
