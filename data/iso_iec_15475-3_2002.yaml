abstract:
- content: "<p>The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a
    description of a mechanism for transferring</p><p>information between modelling
    tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing
    and</p><p>exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform
    to CDIF. The language that is defined for</p><p>the transfer format also has applicability
    as a general language for Import/Export from repositories. The CDIF</p><p>semantic
    metamodel defined for modelling tools also has applicability as the basis of standard
    definitions for use in</p><p>repositories.</p><p>The standards, which form the
    complete family of CDIF Standards, are documented in ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002,</p><p><em>Information
    technology — CDIF framework — Part 1: Overview.</em>These standards cover the
    overall framework,</p><p>the transfer format and the CDIF semantic metamodel.</p><p/><p><strong>Figure
    1</strong>−<strong>Position in the CDIF family of standards</strong></p><p>The
    diagram in Figure 1 depicts the various standards that comprise the CDIF family
    of standards. The shaded box</p><p>depicts this Standard and its position in the
    CDIF family of standards.</p><p>This document describes the standard CDIF Transfer
    Encoding for the standard CDIF Transfer Syntax as defined</p><p>in ISO/IEC 15475-2:2002,<em>Information
    technology —CDIF transfer format — Part 2: Syntax SYNTAX.1</em>.</p><p>This document
    is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document
    provides</p><p>an introduction to the entire CDIF family of standards. It is suitable
    for:</p><p>— Those evaluating CDIF,</p><p>— Those who wish to understand the principles
    and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and</p><p>— Those developing importers and exporters.</p><p>The
    documents ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002,<em>Information technology — CDIF framework — Part
    1: Overview</em>and</p><p>ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002,<em>Information technology — CDIF
    framework — Part 2: Modelling and extensibility</em>should be</p><p>read first
    when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read other documents in
    the CDIF family of</p><p>standards.</p><p>This document should be read in conjunction
    with ISO/IEC 15475-1:2002,<em>Information technology — CDIF transfer</em></p><p><em>format
    — Part 1: General rules for syntaxes and encodings</em>and ISO/IEC 15475-2:2002,<em>Information
    technology —</em></p><p><em>CDIF transfer format — Part 2: Syntax SYNTAX.1.</em></p><p>While
    there are no specific prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful
    for the reader to have familiarity</p><p>with the following:</p><p>— Entity-Relationship-Attribute
    modelling;</p><p>— Modelling (CASE) tools;</p><p>— Information repositories;</p><p>—
    Data dictionaries;</p><p>— Multiple meta-layer modelling;</p><p>— Formal grammars;</p><p>—
    Transfer formats.</p>"
