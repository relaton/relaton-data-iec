abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61340-5-6:2025 establishes a set of methodologies, techniques, and
    instruments to characterize a process where electrostatic discharge (ESD) sensitive
    items (ESDS) are handled. ESD risk assessment covers risks by charged personnel,
    ungrounded conductors, charged ESDS, charged insulators, and ESDS in an electrostatic
    field. This document applies to activities that manufacture, process, assemble,
    install, package, label, service, test, inspect, transport, or otherwise handle
    electrical or electronic parts, assemblies, and equipment susceptible to damage
    by electrostatic discharges. This document does not apply to electrically initiated
    explosive items, flammable gases and liquids or powders. The document does not
    address program management, compliance verification or program manager/coordinator
    certification. Risks due to electromagnetic sources that produce AC fields are
    not considered. This document cancels and replaces IEC PAS 61340-5-6 published
    in 2022. This first edition constitutes a technical revision.
