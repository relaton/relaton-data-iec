  content: "CISPR/TR 30-1:2012(E), which is a technical report, details, with the
    aid of reference luminaires, an independent method by which the radio disturbance
    characteristics of electronic control gear for fluorescent lamp luminaires with
    protection classes I and/or II may be compared against the requirements of CISPR
    15. This technical report covers electronic control gear for double-capped fluorescent
    lamps fitted with G5 or G13 lamp caps and to single-capped fluorescent lamps fitted
    with lamp caps: 2GX7, 2G8, 2G10, 2G11, 2GX13, G23, GX23, G24q, GX24q, GR8, and
    GR10q. It is specifically applicable for equipment to be connected to 230 V -
    50 Hz mains power networks. For other power systems, modifications may be necessary.
    This first edition of CISPR/TR 30-1 cancels and replaces the first edition of
    CISPR/TR 30 published in 2001. It is a technical revision which includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    minor correction of wiring distances of reference luminaire in Figure A.1;<br
    />\r\n- addition of reference luminaires for electronic control gear with output
    terminals on both ends;<br />\r\n- addition of reference luminaires for electronic
    control gear for circular-shaped fluorescent lamps; and<br />\r\n- introduction
    of control gear marking indicating suitability for application in protection class
    I and/or class II luminaires."
