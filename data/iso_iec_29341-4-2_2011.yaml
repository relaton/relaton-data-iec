    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-4-2:2011 The MediaRenderer specification defines a general-purpose device
    template that can be used to instantiate any Consumer Electronics (CE) device
    that is capable of rendering AV content from the home network. It exposes a set
    of rendering controls in which a control point can control how the specified AV
    content is rendered. This includes controlling various rendering features such
    as brightness, contrast, volume, etc. This device specification is compliant with
    the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device
    type referred to herein as MediaRenderer. This International Standard replaces
    ISO/IEC 29341-4-2, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical
    revision."
