    <p>ISO/IEC 15476-6:2006 defines the State/event subject area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. The CDIF semantic metamodel is used to ensure that the information transferred by tools communicating using CDIF is expressed with an agreed meaning. This subject area contains meta-objects that describe the entities of state transition diagrams and state transition tables, and also meta-relationships and meta-attributes that are necessary for available state transition. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15476-6:2006 is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. It provides a definition of a single subject area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. It is suitable for:</p>
    <ul><li>Those evaluating CDIF;</li><li>Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer; and</li><li>Those developing importers and exporters.</li></ul>
