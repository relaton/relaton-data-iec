abstract:
- content: Thin flexible cards, the subject of this International Standard, are used
    to automate the controls for access to goods or services such as mass transit,
    highway toll systems, car parks, vouchers, stored value, etc.  For these applications,
    data can be written and/or read by machines using various recording techniques
    such as magnetic stripe, optical character recognition (OCR), bar code, etc.  ISO/IEC
    15457-3:2008 specifies the test methods and procedures required to carry out measurements
    of the magnetic stripe and encoding characteristics of thin flexible cards.  Many
    of the standard methods available for checking physical properties of base materials
    are intended to be applied to samples cut from continuous material or large sheets.
    However, all test methods given herein, unless explicitly stated otherwise, apply
    to finished cards.  The test methods described are to be performed on separate
    samples. It is not intended that any individual card should pass through more
    than one test procedure, unless explicitly stated.  Acceptance criteria do not
    form part of ISO/IEC 15457-3:2008.
