  content: IEC/TR 61000-3-15:2011(E) is concerned with the critical assessment of
    existing and emerging national and international standards for single and multi-phase
    dispersed generation systems up to 75 A per phase, particularly converters connected
    to the public supply low voltage network. This Technical Report intends to serve
    as a starting point and to ultimately pave the way for the definition of appropriate
    EMC requirements and test conditions. This Technical Report is limited to EMC
    issues (immunity and emission) up to 9 kHz and does not include other aspects
    of connection of generators to the grid. This Technical Report focuses on emission
    caused by distributed generation (mainly harmonics and inter-harmonics, DC emissions
    flicker, rapid voltage changes and fluctuations), as well as immunity aspects
    to normally occurring events in the public supply network (voltage dips and short
    interruptions, frequency variations, harmonics and interharmonics). Every effort
    has been made to utilize already existing emission and immunity standards, including
    the test set-up and existing test equipment in use.
