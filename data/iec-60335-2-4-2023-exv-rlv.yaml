  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-4:2023 EXV and IEC 60355-2-4:2023 RLV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-4:2023 deals with the safety of:<br />\r\n- stand-alone
    electric spin extractors, and<br />\r\n- spin extractors incorporated in washing
    machines that have separate containers for washing and spin extraction<br />\r\nfor
    household and similar purposes that have a capacity not exceeding 10 kg of dry
    cloth and a drum peripheral speed not exceeding 50 m/s, their rated voltages being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as spin extractors intended to be
    used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms and spin extractors for
    communal use in blocks of flats or in launderettes, are within the scope of this
    standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the reasonably
    foreseeable hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons.
    However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons (including
    children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience
    and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision
    or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis eighth edition cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in
    2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes
    to normative text (20.103, 20.104, 22.101);<br />\r\nc) addition of test probe
    19 for accessibility of live parts and moving parts (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nd)
    addition of accessible surface temperature limits (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ne) specified
    operating conditions for battery operated appliances (B.11.1).<br />\r\nThis part
    2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its
    amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
