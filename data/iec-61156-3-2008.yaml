  content: "IEC 61156-3:2008(E) defines individually screened, common overall core
    screen and unscreened pairs or quads in cables for work area wiring. These cables
    are suitable for the various communication systems for which the reference is
    given in the relevant detail specification. The cables covered by this sectional
    specification are intended to operate with voltages and currents normally adopted
    for communication systems. These cables should not be connected to low impedance
    sources, for example, the public mains electricity supply. The cables are specifically
    intended for work area wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision and includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) new requirements for new cables
    Cat3, and Cat5 applications;<br />\r\nb) a better numbering in order to take into
    account the generic specification."
