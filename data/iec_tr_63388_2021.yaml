abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63388:2021 introduces the widely used technical scheme of cogeneration
    (also known as combined heat and power (CHP)), and gives the corresponding cases.
    The technical schemes of cogeneration covered in this technical report can be
    divided into two categories. One is cogeneration based on steam turbine, which
    is generally applied in thermal power plants; The other is cogeneration based
    on other prime movers, such as fuel cell, micro gas turbine, internal combustion
    engine, Stirling engine, ORC, etc.<br />\r\nThis document gives some cases of
    cogeneration, mainly including:<br />\r\n• CHP based on extraction turbine;<br
    />\r\n• CHP based on back pressure turbine;<br />\r\n• Low-vacuum heating mode;<br
    />\r\n• LP cylinder steam bypassed heating mode;<br />\r\n• CHP based on steam
    turbine with synchro-self-shift clutches;<br />\r\n• Gas-steam combined cycle
    CHP;<br />\r\n• Micro gas turbine CHP;<br />\r\n• Stirling engine CHP;<br />\r\n•
    Fuel cell CHP; and<br />\r\n• ORC CHP.<br />\r\nThe characteristics, components
    and technical requirements of these technical schemes are introduced in this document.<br
    />\r\nBy collecting existing standards of CHP, this document also identifies the
    gaps of CHP standardization and put forward a roadmap for future CHP standards.<br
    />\r\nThis document is prepared based on limited expert resources. Thus, some
    cogeneration cases could not be covered in this document, such as:<br />\r\n•
    Solar cogeneration; and<br />\r\n• Internal combustion engine cogeneration."
