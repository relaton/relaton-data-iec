  content: "IEC 62037-3:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62037-3:2021
    defines the impact test on coaxial connectors to evaluate their robustness against
    weak connections and particles inside the connector, as independently as possible
    from the effects of cable PIM (passive intermodulation). For other connectors
    (e.g. panel mounted connectors), the cable can be replaced by an adequate transmission-line
    (e.g. airline, stripline). In order to evaluate the effects of mechanical stresses
    on the connectors, a series of impacts is applied to the connectors while measuring
    the PIM. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2012. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. impact method changed to utilize
    a steel ball rather than a brass rod;<br />\r\nb. impact energy required to test
    each connector type added;<br />\r\nc. method added to calculate impact energy
    for connector types not listed in the document.\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">
