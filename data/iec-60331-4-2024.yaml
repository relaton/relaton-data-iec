  content: "IEC 60331-4:2024 specifies the test apparatus and procedure, and gives
    the performance requirements, including recommended flame application times and
    flame temperatures, for power cables of rated voltage higher than 0,6/1,0 kV up
    to and including 18/30 kV for maintaining circuit integrity when subject to fire
    and mechanical shock under specified conditions.<br />\r\nThe test method in this
    document is restricted to conductor sizes up to and including 120 mm2. The test
    results for 120 mm2 size conductors constructions qualify larger cross-sections
    of the same cable construction.<br />\r\nIn the case of preassembled three-core
    cables, then the complete cable is considered as tested when a complete single-core
    of the cable has been tested.<br />\r\nThis document includes details for the
    specific point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample, test
    procedure and test report relevant to electric power cables with a rated voltage
    higher than 0,6/1,0 kV up to and including 18/30 kV.<br />\r\nAnnex A provides
    the method of verification of the burner and control system used for the test.<br
    />\r\nAnnex B provides a choice of the recommended test apparatus.<br />\r\nAnnex
    C provides, as an option, guidance for using either water spray or water jet protocols.<br
    />\r\nAnnex D provides, as an option, the flame temperature of 1 000 °C, which
    is applicable for special applications.<br />\r\nRequirements are stated for an
    identification that can optionally be marked on the cable to signify compliance
    with this document.<br />\r\nThis group safety publication focusing on the test
    method for circuit integrity safety for power cables of rated voltage higher than
    1 kV up to and including 30 kV under fire conditions, is primarily intended to
    be used as a product safety standard for the products mentioned in the scope,
    but is also intended to be used by TCs in the preparation of publications for
    products similar to those mentioned in the scope of this group safety publication,
    in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide
    51.<br />\r\nOne of the responsibilities of a TC is, wherever applicable, to make
    use of either BSPs or GSPs, or both, in the preparation of its publications.<br
    />\r\nWARNING – The test given in this document can involve the use of dangerous
    voltages and temperatures. Suitable precautions should be taken against the risk
    of shock, burning, fire and explosion that can arise, and against any noxious
    fumes that can be produced."
