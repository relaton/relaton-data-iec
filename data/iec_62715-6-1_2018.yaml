abstract:
- content: "IEC 62715-6-1:2018 defines the standard test methods to evaluate the mechanical
    stability of flexible display modules, specifically mechanical stability against
    deformation, such as bending, rolling, twisting, and stretching. Display modules
    include displays such as LCD, e-paper, and OLED. This document takes into account,
    wherever possible, the mechanical test methods outlined under mechanical stress.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    changed the part title to differentiate it from other parts;<br />\r\nb) added
    new bending testing methods;<br />\r\nc) added detailed testing procedures."
