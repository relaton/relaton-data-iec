abstract:
- content: IEC 63150-2:2025 specifies terms and definitions, and test methods that
    can be used to evaluate and determine the performance characteristics of kinetic
    energy harvesting devices for human arm swing motion. Such kinetic energy harvesting
    devices often have a rotor with eccentric mass to efficiently capture kinetic
    energy at very low frequency range, but this document is not limited to rotational
    energy harvesters. These have different power generation mechanisms (such as electromagnetic,
    piezoelectric, electrostatic, triboelectric, etc.) with different working principles,
    and their performance is evaluated with motions relevant to human arm swing, in
    which large-amplitude low-frequency external mechanical excitations prevail.
