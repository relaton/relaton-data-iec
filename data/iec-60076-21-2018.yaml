  content: "IEC 60076-21:2018 describes electrical, mechanical and test requirements
    of liquid-immersed, single- and three-phase, 50 Hz and 60 Hz, self and forced-air
    cooled, distribution, overhead and substation, step-voltage regulators, 1 000
    kVA (single-phase units) or 3 000 kVA (three-phase units) and smaller, 34 500
    volts and below (2 400 V minimum) and their associated controls. Requirements,
    references and definitions relevant to either IEC or IEEE contexts are given and
    their use is described in Clause 4. This publication is published as an IEC/IEEE
    Dual Logo standard. This second edition cancels and replaces IEC 60076-21, published
    in 2011, and IEEE Std C57.15-2009. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to IEC 60076­21:2011/IEEE Std C57.15-2009:<br />\r\na)
    updated list of normative and bibliography IEC and IEEE references and their associated
    text;<br />\r\nb) updated tables of preferred ratings for inclusion of  maximum
    system voltage (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub>), nominal system voltage and rated voltage
    (<em>U</em><sub>r</sub>);<br />\r\nc) inclusion of tables for optional fan-cooled
    ratings, external dielectric clearances and sound pressure levels;<br />\r\nd)
    revision of short-circuit requirements for distribution and substation voltage
    regulators;<br />\r\ne) inclusion of an universal interface between control enclosure
    and apparatus;<br />\r\nf) inclusion of  tap-changer routine and type tests;<br
    />\r\ng) inclusion of audible sound pressure emissions test procedures;<br />\r\nh)
    inclusion of tank enclosure integrity type test procedures;<br />\r\ni) update
    of control environmental IEC reference test standard.<br />\r\nKeywords: step-voltage
