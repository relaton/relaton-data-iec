    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices operating below 135 kHz. The purpose of ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 is to provide a common technical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products in the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the physical layer used for communication between the interrogator and the tag and further defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.</p>
    <p>Two types of tag are defined by ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009: Type A and Type B, which differ only by their physical layer. Both support the same inventory (anti-collision) and protocol.</p>
    <p>Type A tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, including during the tag-to-interrogator transmission, and operate at 125 kHz. </p>
    <p>Type B tags are powered by the interrogator, except during the tag-to-interrogator transmission, and operate at 125 kHz or 134,2 kHz.</p>
