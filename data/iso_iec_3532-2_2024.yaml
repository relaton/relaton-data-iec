abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 3552-2:2024 This document specifies how augmented reality (AR)
    and virtual reality (VR) devices are to be set up and used in the enterprise workplace
    in a manner that ensures health and safety (H&S) is maintained, H&S consequences
    are understood, and additional risks are not introduced. Within this concept of
    safe usage, there is particular focus on guidance around safe immersion (time)
    and safety in the workplace.<br />\r\nThis document defines the concepts of AR,
    VR, the virtuality continuum and other associated terms such as augmented virtuality
    and mixed reality. This document provides guidance on:<br />\r\na) setting up
    AR systems;<br />\r\nb) setting up VR systems;<br />\r\nc) safe usage and immersion
    in AR systems both in the consumer and enterprise domains;<br />\r\nd) safe usage
    and immersion in VR systems both in the consumer and enterprise domains.<br />\r\nThis
    document focuses on visual aspects of AR and VR. Other modes such as haptics and
    olfactory are not addressed within this document.<br />\r\nThis document covers
    both the hardware (the physical AR/VR head mounted displays) and areas of visual
    stimulus (the environments and graphics displayed in those headsets). This document
    does not cover all possible visual stimulus scenarios; focus is directed toward
    those areas that are known to have implications on safe use. This specifically
    includes the source vection (visual illusion of self-motion in physically stationary
    AR/VR users) and/or motion (physical movement of AR/VR users) and associated safe
    use considerations.<br />\r\nNOTE AR/VR have some shared safety concerns, but
    many are distinct to AR or VR and a consumer or enterprise environment. As such
    all of these are in scope, and this document is structured to account for these
    differences."
