    IEC/TR 62296:2009(E) contains a series of recommendations developed by an expert working group of IEC subcommittee 62A in response to questions of interpretation of the second edition of IEC 60601-1. IEC/TR 62296:2009(E) is primarily intended to be used by:<br />

    - test houses and others responsible for assessment of compliance with IEC 60601-1:1988, and<br />
    - those developing subsequent editions of IEC 60601-1.<br />
    The recommendations in the first edition of IEC/TR 62296 were considered in preparing the third edition of IEC 60601-1. As the third edition of IEC 60601-1 has been published, some of the recommendations in the second edition of IEC/TR 62296 have been changed to align with requirements in IEC 60601-1:2005. Seven additional recommendations have been developed by IEC/SC 62A/WG 14 and are included in this edition of IEC/TR 62296. They are recommendations 57 through 63. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes seven new recommendations: Recommendations 57 through 63. As the third edition of IEC 60601-1 has been published, some of the recommendations in this edition have been changed to align with requirements in IEC 60601-1:2005.
