abstract:
- content: "ISO 81346-10:2022 This document provides rules for structuring of systems
    in the domain of power supply systems, being supplementary to the general principles
    for the structuring of systems including structuring of information about systems
    specified in IEC 81346-1.<br />\r\nBased on these principles, rules and guidance
    are given for the formulation of unambiguous reference designations for objects
    in any system.<br />\r\nThe reference designation identifies objects for the purpose
    of creation and retrieval of information about an object and, where realized,
    about its corresponding component.<br />\r\nA reference designation labelled at
    a component is the key to finding information about that object among different
    kinds of documents.<br />\r\nThe principles are general and are applicable to
    all technical areas (e.g. mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, construction
    engineering, process engineering). They can be used for systems based on different
    technologies or for systems combining several technologies.<br />\r\nThis document
    also defines classes for systems and spaces in the field of power supply systems."
