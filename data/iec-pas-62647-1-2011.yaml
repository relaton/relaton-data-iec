  content: IEC/PAS 62647-1:2011(E) defines the objectives of, and requirements for,
    documenting processes that assure customers and regulatory agencies that aerospace
    and high performance electronic systems containing Pb-free solder, piece parts,
    and boards will satisfy the applicable requirements for performance, reliability,
    airworthiness, safety, and certifiability throughout the specified life of performance.
    The goal is to communicate requirements for a Lead-free Control Plan (LFCP) and
    to assist suppliers in the development of their own plans.
