abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 11770-4:2006 defines key establishment mechanisms based on
    weak secrets, i.e., secrets that can be readily memorized by a human, and hence
    secrets that will be chosen from a relatively small set of possibilities. It specifies
    cryptographic techniques specifically designed to establish one or more secret
    keys based on a weak secret derived from a memorized password, while preventing
    off-line brute-force attacks associated with the weak secret. More specifically,
    these mechanisms are designed to achieve one of the following three goals.</p><strong>Balanced
    password-authenticated key agreement:</strong>Establish one or more shared secret
    keys between two entities that share a common weak secret. In a balanced password-authenticated
    key agreement mechanism, the shared secret keys are the result of a data exchange
    between the two entities, the shared secret keys are established if and only if
    the two entities have used the same weak secret, and neither of the two entities
    can predetermine the values of the shared secret keys.<strong>Augmented password-authenticated
    key agreement:</strong> Establish one or more shared secret keys between two entities<em>A</em>
    and<em>B</em>, where<em>A</em> has a weak secret and<em>B</em> has verification
    data derived from a one-way function of<em>A</em>'s weak secret. In an augmented
    password-authenticated key agreement mechanism, the shared secret keys are the
    result of a data exchange between the two entities, the shared secret keys are
    established if and only if the two entities have used the weak secret and the
    corresponding verification data, and neither of the two entities can predetermine
    the values of the shared secret keys.<strong>Password-authenticated key retrieval:</strong>
    Establish one or more secret keys for an entity,<em>A</em>, associated with another
    entity,<em>B</em>, where<em>A</em> has a weak secret and<em>B</em> has a strong
    secret associated with<em>A</em>'s weak secret. In an authenticated key retrieval
    mechanism, the secret keys, retrievable by<em>A</em>(not necessarily derivable
    by<em>B</em>), are the result of a data exchange between the two entities, and
    the secret keys are established if and only if the two entities have used the
    weak secret and the associated strong secret. However, although<em>B</em>'s strong
    secret is associated with<em>A</em>'s weak secret, the strong secret does not
    (in itself) contain sufficient information to permit either the weak secret or
    the secret keys established in the mechanism to be determined."
