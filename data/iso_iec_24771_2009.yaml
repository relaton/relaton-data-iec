abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24771:2009 defines a protocol for the physical layer (PHY) and
    the data link layer in order to construct a reliable and high-speed data transmission
    network between devices on industrial sites such as factories and plants. This
    network specification provides a standardized protocol to provide a framework
    for various industrial devices to establish a simple, low-cost, energy-efficient,
    and high-speed network between them. In order to fulfil the service requirements
    of the factories and large plants, this network specification is designed to enable
    devices to establish a network by themselves without the help of any infrastructure
    and to reliably exchange various kinds of data, including real-time audio and
    video data, between them. In addition to high transmission rates, Quality of Service
    (QoS) for multimedia data - such as video - is also provided.The devices mentioned
    in ISO/IEC 24771:2009 refer to equipment that can be used on industrial sites
    such as factories and automated assembly lines. Devices include PLC (Programmable
    Logic Controller), and CNC (Computerized Numerical Controller) and manufacturing
    robots. However, beyond such conventional devices, devices mentioned in this document
    include personal IT devices that workers may carry and use while working, including
    cellular phones, personal industrial digital assistants (PDA), and laptop PCs.
