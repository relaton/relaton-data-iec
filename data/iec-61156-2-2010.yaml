  content: "IEC 61156-2:2010(E) defines individually screened or unscreened pair/quad
    cables, with or without overall common screen for horizontal floor wiring. These
    cables are suitable for the various communication systems for which the reference
    is given in the relevant detail specification. The cables covered by this sectional
    specification are intended to operate with voltages and currents normally adopted
    for communication systems. These cables should not be connected to low impedance
    sources, for example, the public mains electricity supply. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2003 and constitutes a technical
    revision. This new edition includes category 3 and 5 cables.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/29628\">IEC
    61156-1:2002</a>."
