abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29121:2018 specifies the data migration method for DVD-R, DVD-RW,
    DVD-RAM, +R, +RW, CD-R, CD-RW, BD Recordable and BD Rewritable disks for long-term
    data storage. By applying this document for information storage, digital data
    can be migrated to a next new disk without loss from the present disk as long
    as data errors are completely corrected before and during the migration and provided
    copying of the data is allowed.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29121:2018 specifies:<br />\r\n-
    a data migration method for long-term data storage;<br />\r\n- test methods including
    test parameters, test area, test drive, disk preparation and test execution;<br
    />\r\n- an initial performance test and a periodic performance test that check
    a readability of the data recorded on the disks with categorized Maximum Data
    Error tables; and<br />\r\n- a necessity of precaution to reduce the possibility
    of deterioration in order to assure the integrity of the disks during their use,
    storage, handling or transportation.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29121:2018 offers guidelines
    to use disks with estimated lifetime of Bmig (B0,000 1) Life which is introduced
    using B5 Life and B50 Life specified in ISO/IEC 16963."
