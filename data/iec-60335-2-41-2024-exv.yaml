  content: "IEC 60335-2-41:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-41:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-41:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric pumps for liquids having a temperature not exceeding 90 °C, intended
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances. Examples of
    appliances within the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n- aquarium pumps;<br
    />\r\n- garden pond pumps;<br />\r\n- shower-boost pumps;<br />\r\n- sludge pumps;<br
    />\r\n- submersible pumps;<br />\r\n- table fountain pumps;<br />\r\n- vertical
    wet pit pumps.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use, but
    that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by ap-pliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in gen-eral, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authori-ties, the national authorities responsible for
    the protection of labour and similar au-thorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- stationary circulation pumps for heating and service water
    installations (IEC 60335-2-51);<br />\r\n- pumps for flammable liquids;<br />\r\n-
    pumps intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- pumps intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- pumps
    incorporating chlorinators of the electrolytic type.<br />\r\nPumps incorporated
    in appliances are not covered by this standard unless a specific ref-erence is
    made.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published
    in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) modification
    or conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 7.12.1, 25.7);<br />\r\nc)
    introduction of IEC 60417 symbol for maximum operating depth and indoor use only
    (7.1, 7.6, 7.12.1);<br />\r\nd) clarification of requirements for aquarium pumps
    and garden pond pumps;<br />\r\ne) addition of legibility requirements for markings
    exposed to solar radiation (7.14);<br />\r\nf) clarification of pumps subjected
    to test probe 18 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\ng) introduction of accessible surface
    temperature limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nh) addition of requirements for IEC 61984
    connectors for pumps intended for permanent connection to fixed wiring (22.107,
    24.1.5, 24.1.101, 25.3).<br />\r\ni) clarifications on remote operation for pumps
    in scope of this standard (22.40, 22.49, 22,51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be
    used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
