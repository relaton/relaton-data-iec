  content: IEC 60287-2-1:2023 is solely applicable to the conditions of steady-state
    operation of cables at all alternating voltages, and direct voltages up to 5 kV,
    buried directly in the ground, in ducts, in troughs or in steel pipes, both with
    and without partial drying-out of the soil, as well as cables in air. The term
    "steady state" is intended to mean a continuous constant current (100 % load factor)
    just sufficient to produce asymptotically the maximum conductor temperature, the
    surrounding ambient conditions being assumed constant.
