  content: Deals with the safety of pedestrian-controlled mains-operated electric
    lawn scarifiers and aerators. These scarifiers have rotating cutters for regenerating
    lawns by, for instance, combing out grass thatch and moss, or by cutting vertically
    into the lawn face. These scarifiers are designed primarily for home use, with
    a rated voltage not more than 250 V single phase. For lawnmowers, see IEC 60335-2-77;
    for lawn trimmers, see IEC 60335-2-91.
