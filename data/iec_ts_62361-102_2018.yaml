abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62361-102:2018(E) outlines a technical approach for achieving effective
    information exchange between power system installations governed by IEC 61850
    and business systems integrated with IEC CIM standard data exchanges, based on
    a selected specific set of use cases, but also with the goal of creating a framework
    that will extend successfully to other use cases in the future. This document
    includes proposals to ‘harmonize’ the two standards by adapting or extending existing
    information models and/or defining new models, where such changes will enable
    more effective communication. Both current and future directions of models will
    be considered. The report will take into account existing standards for semantics,
    services, protocols, system configuration language, and architecture.
