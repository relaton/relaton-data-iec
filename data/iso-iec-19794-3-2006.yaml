  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19794-3:2006, the finger pattern spectral data interchange
    format, specifies requirements for the representation of local or global spectral
    data derived from a fingerprint image. The format is designed to provide flexibility
    in the choice of spectral representation in that spectral components may be based
    on quantized co-sinusoidal triplets, Discrete Fourier Transformations or Gabor
    filters. The format also allows for a variable number of spectral components to
    be retained, which enables data representations in a form that is more compact
    than storage of the entire fingerprint image. ISO/IEC 19794-3:2006 provides example
    data records for each of the spectral representations.</p>"
