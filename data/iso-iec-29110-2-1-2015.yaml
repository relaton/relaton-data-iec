    1.1   Fields of application  <p>ISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). The lifecycle processes described in ISO/IEC 29110 are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs. However, certain issues faced by large organizations might not be covered by ISO/IEC 29110.</p>
    <p>The lifecycle processes defined in ISO/IEC 29110 can be used by VSEs when acquiring and using, as well as when creating and supplying, a software, and systems. They can be applied at any level in a software and systems structure and at any stage in the lifecycle. The processes described in ISO/IEC 29110 are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that VSEs find useful.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 introduces the major concepts for software and systems engineering profiles for VSEs, and defines the terms common to the set of documents associated with VSE profiles.</p>
    <p>It establishes the logic behind the definition and application of profiles. It specifies the elements common to all standardized profiles (structure, conformance, assessment).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 is applicable to all profiles.</p>
    1.2   Target audience  <p>ISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 is targeted at authors and reviewers of standardized profiles, authors of other parts, and authors of other VSE profiles.</p>
