abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29102:2015 is to provide a method to determine the ink cartridge
    photo yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink
    cartridges without integrated printheads) for colour photo printing with colour
    inkjet printers and multifunction devices that contain inkjet printer components.
    In the case where a cartridge set can be used in multiple printer models, only
    one yield test needs to be performed as long as the difference between printer
    models does not impact yield.</p><p>NOTE A cartridge supplier may choose to use
    more than one market identifier for a single physical cartridge. In this case
    only one yield test is required as long as there are no differences in the cartridges
    other than market identifiers.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29102:2015 prescribes the following:</p><p>-
    the test method that manufacturers, test laboratories, etc. use to determine ink
    cartridge photo yield;</p><p>- the method for determination of declared photo
    yield values from the test results; and</p><p>- the appropriate method of describing
    the photo yield of cartridges in documentation supplied to the consumer by the
    manufacturer.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29102:2015 is only intended for the determination
    of ink cartridge photo yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding
    quality, reliability, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29102:2015 can be used to determine the
    yield of any cartridge that is used during the printing of the photo test file
    defined in ISO/IEC 29103.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29102:2015 is not for use with printers
    whose minimum printable size is equal to or greater than A3. This International
    Standard is not intended to measure the yield of photo printing on paper size
    larger than 4Ã—6, L or A6. In addition, this International Standard is not for
    use with industrial printers or point of sale printers. It only applies to desktop
    printing systems.</p>"
