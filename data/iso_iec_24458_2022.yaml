abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24458:2022 This document specifies the performance evaluation
    specifications of thermal transfer type printers (hereinafter referred to as bar
    code printers), consumables, and bar code readers (regardless of the reading method)
    used in bar code systems. The rank of performance is also defined by the evaluation
    items.<br />\r\nThis document can be applied to the following evaluation tests
    by combining ISO/IEC 15416 and ISO/IEC 15415, which define the print qualities
    of bar code symbols.<br />\r\nNOTE This document is not prevented from being cited
    in the evaluation of thermal printers using thermal paper and printers using “plain
    or exclusive paper” (commercial printing, ink jet printers, electrophotographic
    printers, etc.).<br />\r\na) Print performance of bar code printers (including
    consumables)<br />\r\nb) Brightness and smoothness of “reception paper or label”,
    and adhesion of the label<br />\r\nc) Strength of reception paper or label on
    which the bar code is printed<br />\r\nd) Reading performance of bar code readers<br
    />\r\ne) Electrical, mechanical and environmental characteristics of bar code
    printers and bar code readers"
