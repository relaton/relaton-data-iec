abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the performance evaluation specifications of
    thermal transfer type printers (hereinafter referred to as bar code printers),
    consumables, and bar code readers (regardless of the reading method) used in bar
    code systems. The rank of performance is also defined by the evaluation items.</p><p>This
    document can be applied to the following evaluation tests by combining ISO/IEC
    15416 and ISO/IEC 15415, which define the print qualities of bar code symbols.</p><p>NOTE
    This document is not prevented from being cited in the evaluation of thermal printers
    using thermal paper and printers using “plain or exclusive paper” (commercial
    printing, ink jet printers, electrophotographic printers, etc.).</p><p>a) Print
    performance of bar code printers (including consumables)</p><p>b) Brightness and
    smoothness of “reception paper or label”, and adhesion of the label</p><p>c) Strength
    of reception paper or label on which the bar code is printed</p><p>d) Reading
    performance of bar code readers</p><p>e) Electrical, mechanical and environmental
    characteristics of bar code printers and bar code readers</p>"
