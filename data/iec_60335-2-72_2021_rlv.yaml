abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-72:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-72:2021
    deals with the safety of powered ride-on and powered walk-behind machines intended
    for commercial indoor or outdoor use for the following applications:<br />\r\n-
    sweeping,<br />\r\n- scrubbing,<br />\r\n- wet or dry pick-up,<br />\r\n- polishing,<br
    />\r\n- application of wax, sealing products and powder-based detergents,<br />\r\n-
    shampooing<br />\r\nof floors.<br />\r\nThese machines have a cleaning motion
    which is more linear than lateral or periodic. This standard applies to machines
    for commercial use. The following list, although not comprehensive, gives an indication
    of locations that are included in the scope:<br />\r\n- public use areas such
    as hotels, schools, hospitals;<br />\r\n- industrial locations, for example factories
    and manufacturing shops;<br />\r\n- retail outlets, for example shops and supermarkets;<br
    />\r\n- business premises, for example offices and banks;<br />\r\n- all uses
    other than normal housekeeping purposes.<br />\r\nThese machines may be equipped
    with a traction drive system. The following power systems are covered:<br />\r\n-
    internal combustion engines,<br />\r\n- mains powered motors up to a rated voltage
    of 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances,<br />\r\n-
    battery-operated machines.<br />\r\nBattery-operated machines may be equipped
    with a built-in battery charger.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n-
    floor treatment appliances for household use (IEC 60335-2-10);<br />\r\n- floor
    treatment machines for commercial use (IEC 60335-2-67);<br />\r\n- spray extraction
    machines for commercial use (IEC 60335-2-68);<br />\r\n- wet and dry vacuum cleaners,
    including power brush, for commercial use (IEC 60335-2-69);<br />\r\n- road sweepers;<br
    />\r\n- machines designed for use on slopes with a gradient exceeding 20 %;<br
    />\r\n- machines equipped with a power take-off (PTO);<br />\r\n- machines designed
    for use in corrosive or explosive environments (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n-
    machines designed for picking up hazardous dusts (as defined in IEC 60335-2-69),
    inflammable substances, or glowing particles;<br />\r\n- machines designed for
    use in vehicles or on board of ships or aircraft.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn
    to the fact that<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements on the safe
    use of the equipment covered can be specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national
    water supply authorities and similar authorities;<br />\r\n- ride-on machines
    designed for transport over public roads can be subject to additional requirements
    (e.g. lighting, license plate etc.).<br />\r\nRequirements for fuel-cells are
    under consideration. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition
    published in 2016. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\n- editorial and technical alignment
    with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\n- rearrangement of subclauses to consistent numbering
    22.101 to 22.113.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest
    edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis of
    the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
