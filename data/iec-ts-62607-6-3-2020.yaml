  content: "IEC TS 62607:2020 establishes a standardized method to determine the structural
    key control characteristic<br />\r\n– domain size<br />\r\nfor films consisting
    of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on copper by<br />\r\n–
    substrate oxidation.<br />\r\nIt provides a fast, facile and reliable method to
    evaluate graphene domains formed on copper foil or copper film for understanding
    the effect of the graphene domain size on properties of graphene and enhancing
    the performance of high speed, flexible, and transparent devices using CVD graphene.<br
    />\r\n– The domain size determined in accordance with this document will be listed
    as a key control characteristic in the blank detail specification for graphene
    IEC 62565-3-1. Domain density is an equivalent measure.<br />\r\n– The domain
    size as derived by this method is defined as the mean value of size of the domains
    in the observed area specified by supplier in terms of cm2 or µm2.<br />\r\n–
    The method is applicable for graphene grown on copper by CVD. The characterization
    is done on the copper foil before transfer to the final substrate.<br />\r\n–
    As the method is destructive, the samples cannot be re-launched into the fabrication
    process."
