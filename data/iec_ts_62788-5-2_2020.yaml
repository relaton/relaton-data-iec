abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62788-5-2:2020 provides guidelines to assess the ability of an edge
    seal to prevent moisture ingress from the edges of PV modules. This document does
    not cover frame adhesives (sometimes colloquially referred to as edge seals) which
    by design do not serve to prevent moisture ingress to a meaningful degree. Edge
    seals should keep moisture out, remain adhered, and maintain electrically insulation
    from the environment. Much of the testing can be done on the material level, but
    given the fact that there are multiple surfaces, materials interactions, and mechanical
    stresses, testing on mini modules or modules is necessary. To accomplish this,
    this document contains three types of test sample types, materials, mini-modules,
    and full-size modules. It is intended that a quick evaluation and comparison can
    be made using materials only. This would be followed up by more rigorous tests
    using mini-modules where all the interfaces are correctly represented. And finally,
    full-size module tests are used to evaluate the actual construction process to
    allow unanticipated concerns to be addressed.
