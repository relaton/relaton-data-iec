  content: "IEC TS 62668-1:2016(E) defines requirements for avoiding the use of counterfeit,
    recycled and fraudulent components used in the aerospace, defence and high performance
    (ADHP) industries. It also defines requirements for ADHP industries to maintain
    their intellectual property (IP) for all of their products and services. The risks
    associated with purchasing components outside of franchised distributor networks
    are considered in IEC TS 62668-2. Although developed for the avionics industry,
    this specification may be applied by other high performance and high reliability
    industries at their discretion. This new edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- identified
    that the Chinese RECS scheme is no longer maintained;<br />\r\n- added a reference
    to AS/EN/JISQ 9100;<br />\r\n- added reference to the now published SAE AS6496;<br
    />\r\n- added reference to more GAO, OECD and ICC reports;<br />\r\n- updated
    weblinks and other references."
