    <p>This document describes Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is an ontology that is conformant to the requirements specified for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838‑1.</p>
    <p>It describes BFO as a resource designed to support the interchange of information among heterogeneous information systems. The following are within the scope of this document:</p>
    <p>—    definitions of BFO-2020 terms and relations;</p>
    <p>—    axiomatizations of BFO-2020 in OWL 2 and CL;</p>
    <p>—    documentation of the conformity of BFO-2020 to the requirements specified for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838‑1;</p>
    <p>—    specification of the requirements for a domain ontology if it is to serve as a module in a suite of ontologies in which BFO serves as top-level ontology hub by providing a starting point for the introduction of the most general terms in those domain ontologies which are its nearest neighbours within the suite;</p>
    <p>—    specification of the role played by the terms in BFO in the formulation of definitions and axioms in ontologies at lower levels that conform to BFO.</p>
    <p>The following are outside the scope of this document:</p>
    <p>—    specification of ontology languages, including the languages RDF, OWL, and CL standardly used in ontology development;</p>
    <p>—    specification of methods for reasoning with ontologies;</p>
    <p>—    specification of translators between the notations of ontologies developed in different ontology languages.</p>
