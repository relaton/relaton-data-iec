  content: IEC TR 63065:2017+AMD1:2022 provides general guidance on basic principles
    and general proposals for the safe and economic operation and maintenance of an
    LCC converter station. These guidelines are based on the operation and maintenance
    practices that have been used successfully during the last decades at HVDC converter
    stations all over the world, and can be referred to by new HVDC users to optimize
    operation and maintenance policy and assist in performing the operation and maintenance
    work. This document focuses only on the operation and maintenance of the equipment
    inside an LCC converter station, including back-to-back HVDC systems. The operation
    and maintenance of HVDC overhead transmission lines, HVDC cables and voltage sourced
    converter (VSC) are not covered by this document.
