abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11889-1:2015 defines the architectural elements of the Trusted Platform Module
    (TPM), a device which enables trust in computing platforms in general. Some TPM
    concepts are explained adequately in the context of the TPM itself. Other TPM
    concepts are explained in the context of how a TPM helps establish trust in a
    computing platform. When describing how a TPM helps establish trust in a computing
    platform, ISO/IEC 11889-1:2015 provides some guidance for platform requirements.
    However, the scope of ISO/IEC 11889 is limited to TPM requirements.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11889-1:2015 illustrates TPM security and privacy techniques in the context of
    a platform through the use of cryptography. It includes definitions of how different
    cryptographic techniques are implemented by a TPM. The scope of ISO/IEC 11889
    does not include cryptographic analysis or guidance about the applicability of
    different algorithms for specific uses cases.<br />\r\nTPM requirements in ISO/IEC
    11889-1:2015 are general, covering concepts like integrity protection, isolation
    and confidentially. Defining a specific strength of function or assurance level
    is out of scope for ISO/IEC 11889. This approach limits the guarantees provided
    by ISO/IEC 11889 itself, but it does allow the TPM architectural elements defined
    to be adapted to meet diverse implementation and platform specific needs."
