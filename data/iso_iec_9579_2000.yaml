abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard, Remote Database Access for SQL (RDA),
    defines a model for the remote</p><p>interaction of an SQL-client and one or more
    SQL-servers through communication media, and defines</p><p>the encoding of messages,
    the semantics of messages and associated facilities for mediating the</p><p>interaction
    between one SQL-client and one SQL-server.</p><p>This International Standard also
    defines a mapping of the RDA Protocol to the specific communication</p><p>inhastructures
    TCPIIP and Transport Layer Security (TLS).</p><p>This International Standard relies
    upon the facilities provided by ISOIIEC 9075 (SQL) and</p><p>ISOIIEC 9075-3 (SQLICLI).</p><p>This
    International Standard also:</p><p>- identifies potential security vulnerabilities
    in remote database access using RDA,</p><p>- defines RDA facilities which protect
    against the potential vulnerabilities.</p><p>Normative annexes provide:</p><p>-
    a Conformance Proforma,</p><p>- an optional language independent Application Programming
    Interface defined in the notational</p><p>conventions of ISOIIEC 9075-3 (SQLICLI)
    for invoking RDA Operations,</p><p>- an optional mapping of ISOIIEC 9075-3 (SQLICLI)
    functions to RDA Operations,</p><p>- definitions of optional SQL-servers, the
    RDA Location Server and the RDA Support Server, to</p><p>facilitate interoperation
    and data distribution in a heterogeneous environment,</p><p>- a set of security
    profiles that identify which RDA facilities and other security facilities are
    required</p><p>for different levels of protection against potential vulnerabilities.</p><p>Informative
    annexes provide:</p><p>- an analysis of security service requirements,</p><p>-
    an ASN. 1 specification for the RDA Protocol,</p><p>- an ASN. 1 specification
    for the encoding of multiple rows.</p><p>This International Standard does not
    constrain:</p><p>- conforming RDA-client environments to be implemented using
    any particular processor</p><p>decomposition,</p><p>- conforming RDA-server environments
    to be implemented using any particular processor</p><p>decomposition.</p><p>This
    International Standard refers to but does not define:</p><p>- protocols and security
    mechanisms for communication confidentiality, integrity and authentication</p><p>of
    communicating peers,</p><p>- digital signature and authentication mechanisms supported
    by protocol elements of RDA.</p><p>This International Standard does not define:</p><p>?
    algorithms for query decomposition or for the combining of results in a distributed
    database</p><p>environment,</p><p>? mechanisms for recovery in the event that
    transaction co-ordination fails,</p><p>? mechanisms for storage integrity and
    confidentiality using cryptography,</p><p>? mechanisms to counter Denial of Service
    attacks.</p>"
