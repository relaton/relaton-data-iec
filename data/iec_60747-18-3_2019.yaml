abstract:
- content: IEC 60747-18-3:2019(E) specifies the fluid flow characteristics of lens-free
    CMOS photonic array sensor package modules with fluidic system for bio analysis.
    This document includes the measurement set-up, measurement and calculation at
    initial state flow, criteria of the fluidic system for quality assurance, measurement
    and calculation at steady-state flow, and test report.
