abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29123:2007 defines a series of requirement and tests used
    to enhance the interoperability of proximity cards (PICC) and proximity coupling
    devices (PCD) defined in the ISO/IEC 14443 series and tested in accordance with
    ISO/IEC 10373-6.</p><p>Conformance to ISO/IEC TR 29123:2007 should increase the
    chance that the PICCs and PCDs designed to the ISO/IEC 14443 series of standards
    will be interoperable.</p>"
