  content: "IEC 60974-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60974-1:2021 is applicable
    to power sources for arc welding and allied processes designed for industrial
    and professional use, and supplied by a voltage not exceeding 1 000 V, battery
    supplied or driven by mechanical means. This document specifies safety and performance
    requirements of welding power sources and plasma cutting systems. This sixth edition
    cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2017 and Amendment 1:2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Table 1 with an alphabetical cross-reference listing of terms added;<br />\r\n-
    clearance and creepage distance reference document changed to IEC 60664-1:2020;<br
    />\r\n- 6.1.2 and 6.1.3 modified to follow IEC 60664-1 basic insulation dimensioning
    for mains supply with rationalized voltages;<br />\r\n- abnormal capacitor test
    of 6.2.2 moved to new Subclause 9.5;<br />\r\n- 6.2.5 and 6.3.6 modified to use
    touch current measuring network weighted for letgo-immobilization and supply voltage
    tolerance requirement added;<br />\r\n- 16.3 new structure and accuracy requirement
    for displayed voltage value ;<br />\r\n- Annex A changed to normative and Table
    A.2 and Table A.3 added;<br />\r\n- Annex L editorial update to standardized symbols;<br
    />\r\n- redraft of efficiency and idle state power measurement in Annex M based
    on IEC 62301:2011;<br />\r\n- Annex N measurement network weighted for letgo-immobilization
    added.</p>"
