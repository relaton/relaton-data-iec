abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 24714-1:2008 gives guidelines for the stages in the life cycle
    of a system's biometric and associated elements. This covers the following:<br
    />\r\n\t the capture and design of initial requirements, including legal frameworks;<br
    />\r\n\t development and deployment;<br />\r\n\t operations, including enrolment
    and subsequent usage;<br />\r\n\t interrelationships with other systems;<br />\r\n\t
    related data storage and security of data;<br />\r\n\t data updates and maintenance;<br
    />\r\n\t training and awareness;<br />\r\n\t system evaluation and audit;<br />\r\n\t
    controlled system expiration.<br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nThe areas addressed are
    limited to the design and implementation of biometric technologies with respect
    to the following:<br />\r\n\t legal and societal constraints on the use of biometric
    data;<br />\r\n\t accessibility for the widest population;<br />\r\n\t health
    and safety, addressing the concerns of users regarding direct potential hazards
    as well as the possibility of the misuse of inferred data from biometric information.<br
    /><br /><br /><br />\r\nThe intended audiences for ISO/IEC TR 24714-1:2008 are
    planners, implementers and system operators of biometric systems."
