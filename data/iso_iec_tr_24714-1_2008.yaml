    cycle of a system's biometric and associated elements. This covers the following:</p><ul><li>the
    capture and design of initial requirements, including legal frameworks;</li><li>development
    and deployment;</li><li>operations, including enrolment and subsequent usage;</li><li>interrelationships
    with other systems;</li><li>related data storage and security of data;</li><li>data
    updates and maintenance;</li><li>training and awareness;</li><li>system evaluation
    and audit;</li><li>controlled system expiration.</li></ul><p>The areas addressed
    are limited to the design and implementation of biometric technologies with respect
    to the following:</p><ul><li>legal and societal constraints on the use of biometric
    data;</li><li>accessibility for the widest population;</li><li>health and safety,
    addressing the concerns of users regarding direct potential hazards as well as
