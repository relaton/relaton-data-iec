    IEC 62860-1:2013(E) covers recommended methods and standardized reporting practices for electrical characterization of printed and organic ring oscillators. Due to the nature of printed and organic circuits, significant measurement errors can be introduced if the electrical characterization design-of-experiment is not properly addressed. This standard describes the most common sources of measurement error, particularly for high-impedance electrical measurements commonly required for printed and organic ring oscillators. This standard also gives recommended practices in order to minimize and/or characterize the effect of measurement artifacts and other sources of error encountered while measuring printed and organic ring oscillators.
    Keywords: electrical characterization, high-impedance printing, organic transistor, printed electronics, ring oscillator
