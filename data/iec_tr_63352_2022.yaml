abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63352:2022 describes a high-dynamic-range spectrum measurement system
    to measure spectra in the frequency range 140 GHz to 300 GHz. Although millimeter-wave
    (mmWave) technology has high potential for both industries and users, there are
    no developed techniques for evaluating spectra suppressing the unwanted response
    generated in the measurement system. This document also provides background information,
    describes system configurations, key mmWave pre-selector technology, as well as
    some examples of the spurious measurement of antennas under test (AUTs) over the
    air.
