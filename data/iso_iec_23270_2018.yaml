abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation
    of programs written in the C# programming language. It describes:</p><p>— The
    representation of C# programs;</p><p>— The syntax and constraints of the C# language;</p><p>—
    The semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;</p><p>— The restrictions and
    limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.</p><p>This specification
    does not describe</p><p>— The mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for
    use by a data-processing system;</p><p>— The mechanism by which C# applications
    are invoked for use by a data-processing system;</p><p>— The mechanism by which
    input data are transformed for use by a C# application;</p><p>— The mechanism
    by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;</p><p>—
    The size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity
    of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;</p><p>—
    All minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting
    a conforming implementation.</p>"
