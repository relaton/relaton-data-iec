- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    23270:2018 This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation
    of programs written in the C# programming language. It describes:<br />\r\n— The
    representation of C# programs;<br />\r\n— The syntax and constraints of the C#
    language;<br />\r\n— The semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;<br />\r\n—
    The restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.<br />\r\nThis
    specification does not describe<br />\r\n— The mechanism by which C# programs
    are transformed for use by a data-processing system;<br />\r\n— The mechanism
    by which C# applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;<br />\r\n—
    The mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C# application;<br
    />\r\n— The mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced
    by a C# application;<br />\r\n— The size or complexity of a program and its data
    that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity
    of a particular processor;<br />\r\n— All minimal requirements of a data-processing
    system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation."
