abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61968-900:2015(E) is a companion document to the official standard
    IEC 61968-9. It is written from the viewpoint of a software developer or systems
    integrator who is tasked with implementing IEC 61968-9. It is not intended as
    a complete description of this standard. For full details, please refer to IEC
    61968-9. This technical report contains informative recommendations which may
    be used to guide implementations of IEC 61968-9 and IEC 61968-100. It does not
    attempt to be exhaustive. In particular, it focuses on the most common IEC 61968-9
    interfaces and assumes the user is using web services or JMS as the underlying
    transport mechanism. If the user is using other systems or the transport services
    are something other than web services or JMS, the recommendations in this technical
    report may be less relevant but perhaps still useful.
