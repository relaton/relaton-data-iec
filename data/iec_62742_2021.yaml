abstract:
- content: "IEC 62742:2021 specifies minimum requirements for emission, immunity and
    performance criteria regarding electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of electrical
    and electronic equipment for ships with non-metallic hull.<br />\r\nNOTE Requirements
    for metallic hull are given by IEC 60533. This documents acts an extension of
    IEC 60533 to cater for EMC effects on non-metallic hull.<br />\r\nThis document
    further gives guidance on how to achieve electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) on
    ships whose hull (surface) is made from non-metallic material and can also be
    useful for ships with hull comprising of a metallic hull, but with non-metallic
    superstructure or components.<br />\r\nThis document assists in meeting the requirements
    of IMO resolution A.813(19).<br />\r\nIt does not specify basic safety requirements
    such as protection against electric shock and dielectric tests for equipment.
    Electromagnetic effects on human beings are not the subject of this document."
