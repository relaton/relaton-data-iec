abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the scope and key concepts of mixed and augmented
    reality, the relevant terms and their definitions and a generalized system architecture
    that together serve as a reference model for mixed and augmented reality (MAR)
    applications, components, systems, services and specifications. This architectural
    reference model establishes the set of required sub-modules and their minimum
    functions, the associated information content and the information models to be
    provided and/or supported by a compliant MAR system.</p><p>The reference model
    is intended for use by current and future developers of MAR applications, components,
    systems, services or specifications to describe, compare, contrast and communicate
    their architectural design and implementation. The MAR reference model is designed
    to apply to MAR systems independent of specific algorithms, implementation methods,
    computational platforms, display systems and sensors or devices used.</p><p>This
    document does not specify how a particular MAR application, component, system,
    service or specification is designed, developed or implemented. It does not specify
    the bindings of those designs and concepts to programming languages or the encoding
    of MAR information through any coding technique or interchange format. This document
    contains a list of representative system classes and use cases with respect to
    the reference model.</p>"
