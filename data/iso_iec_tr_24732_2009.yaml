abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24732:2009 specifies an extension to the programming language
    C, specified by the International Standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999. The extension provides
    support for decimal floating-point arithmetic that is intended to be consistent
    with the specification in IEEE 754-2008. Any conflict between the requirements
    described here and that specification is unintentional. ISO/IEC TR 24732:2009
    defers to IEEE 754-2008.</p><p>The binary floating-point arithmetic as specified
    in IEEE 754-2008 is not considered in ISO/IEC TR 24732:2009.</p>"
