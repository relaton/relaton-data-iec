    ISO/IEC 27033-4:2014 gives guidance for securing communications between networks using security gateways (firewall, application firewall, Intrusion Protection System, etc.) in accordance with a documented information security policy of the security gateways, including:<br />
    1) identifying and analysing network security threats associated with security gateways;<br />
    2) defining network security requirements for security gateways based on threat analysis;<br />
    3) using techniques for design and implementation to address the threats and control aspects associated with typical network scenarios; and<br />
    4) addressing issues associated with implementing, operating, monitoring and reviewing network security gateway controls.
