    security gateways, including:</p><ol><li>identifying and analysing network security
    threats associated with security gateways;</li><li>defining network security requirements
    for security gateways based on threat analysis;</li><li>using techniques for design
    and implementation to address the threats and control aspects associated with
    typical network scenarios; and</li><li>addressing issues associated with implementing,
    operating, monitoring and reviewing network security gateway controls.</li></ol>"
