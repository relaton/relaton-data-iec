  content: "IEC 60533:2015(E) specifies minimum requirements for emission, immunity
    and performance criteria regarding electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of electrical
    and electronic equipment for ships with metallic hull. This International Standard
    assists in meeting the relevant EMC requirements as stated in SOLAS 74, Chapter
    IV, Regulation 6 and Cha pter V, Regulation 17. Reference to this International
    Standard is made in IMO Resolution A.813(19). This edition includes the followi
    ng significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Introduction has been supplemented;<br />\r\n- scope and title have been modified
    to limit the application of the standard to installations in ships with metallic
    hulls only;<br />\r\n- the normative references have been updated;<br />\r\n-
    further explanation for in-situ testing has been given in 5.1;<br />\r\n- numbering
    of CISPR-Standards in Tables 1, 2 and 3 has been updated;<br />\r\n- title of
    Annex B has been changed;<br />\r\n- requirements on cable routing in Annex B
    have been amended;<br />\r\n- new Annex C EMC test report has been added."
