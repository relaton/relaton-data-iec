    <p>Requirements engineering (RE) is an essential process of the systems and software engineering life cycles. RE has been established as an ISO/IEC standard life cycle process in both ISO/IEC 15288:2008, <i>Systems </i><i>and software e</i><i>ngineering — System life cycle process</i><i>es</i> and ISO/IEC 12207:2008, <i>Systems and software engineering</i><i> — </i><i>Software l</i><i>ife cycle process</i><i>es</i>.</p>
    <p>This Technical Report provides guidance on desirable capabilities of RE tools. It supplements ISO/IEC 14102:2008, <i>Information </i><i>t</i><i>echnology — Guideline for the evaluation and selection of CASE tools</i>, which details a set of evaluation criteria for CASE tools without referencing a specific activity or service area.</p>
