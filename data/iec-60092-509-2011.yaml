    on electrical generation, conversion and distribution systems and electrical equipment
    in ships, including all a.c and d.c. voltages. This standard sets out the requirements
    for the safe operation of work and activity on, with, or near electrical installations.
    These requirements apply to operational, working and maintenance activities. It
    applies to all electrical work activities as well as non-electrical work activities
    such as structural work near electrical equipment and cables. This standard does
    not apply to ordinary persons when using installations and equipment, provided
    that the installations and equipment are designed and installed for use by ordinary
    persons and comply with relevant requirements of the IEC 60092 series.
