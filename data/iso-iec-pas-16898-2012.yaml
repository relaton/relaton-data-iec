  content: "ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 specifies a designation system as well as the shapes
    and dimensions for secondary lithium-ion cells for integration into battery packs
    and systems used in electrically propelled road vehicles including the position
    of the terminals and any over-pressure safety device (OPSD). It is related to
    cylindrical, prismatic and pouch cells.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe cell designation
    according to ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 is intended to be applied to the cells used
    for electrically propelled road vehicles. ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 does not apply
    to cells specifically used for mopeds, motorcycles and vehicles not primarily
    defined as road vehicles, i.e. material handling trucks or forklifts.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe cell dimensions listed in ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012 are recommended but
    not restricted for use in passenger cars up to 3,5 t.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe inner
    design, the cell chemistry, the electrical characteristics and any further properties
    of the cells are not defined in ISO/IEC PAS 16898:2012."
