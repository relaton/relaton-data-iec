    <p>ISO/IEC TR 19788-11:2017 provides guidance in the form of rules and heuristics for the development of a conversion script from an IEEE 1484.12.1-2002 (LOM) record to an MLR data element set.</p>
    <p>Not all of LOM can be mapped to the MLR. As more parts are added to the ISO/IEC 19788 series, future version of this document is expected to provide a better coverage of the LOM metadata.</p>
