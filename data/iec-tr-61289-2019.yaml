    regarding the safe and effective operation of HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT
    and HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL ACCESSORIES (also referred to as HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT
    in this document). It is also of use to scientific/technical staff who have responsibility
    for the maintenance of this equipment. The application guidelines in this document
    deal with the safe operation of HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT constructed
    according to the safety requirements of IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-2-2. Not all
    existing HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT meets the minimum requirements of current
    international standards, however, the guidelines in this document is still helpful
    in utilizing these devices. IEC TR 61289:2019 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) general adaption to IEC 60601-2-2:2017;<br />\r\nb) refinement
    and additions to the defined terms;<br />\r\nc) separation of HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT
    and HF SURGICAL ACCESSORIES;<br />\r\nd) consideration of the HIGH CURRENT MODE;<br
    />\r\ne) update of symbols."
