abstract:
- content: "IEC 61326-2-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61326:2020
    specifies more detailed test configurations, operational conditions and performance
    criteria for equipment with test and measurement circuits (internal or, external
    to the equipment, or both) that are not EMC protected for operational and/or functional
    reasons, as specified by the manufacturer. The manufacturer specifies the environment
    for which the product is intended to be used and selects the appropriate test
    level specifications of IEC 61326-1:2020."
