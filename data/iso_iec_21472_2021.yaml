abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses:</p><p>— requirements for planning, executing
    and reporting the influence of user interaction on biometric system performance
    based on scenario test methodologies, considering three kinds of factors:</p><p>a)
    factors related to the design, position or condition of the capture device,</p><p>b)
    factors depending on users and user attributes,</p><p>c) factors depending on
    the interaction of users with the biometric system;</p><p>— specifications for
    the definition, establishment and measurement of conditions needed for evaluation,
    including those relating to equipment;</p><p>— requirements for establishing a
    reference evaluation condition (REC) and target evaluation condition(s) (TEC)
    to compare the influence of user interaction factors;</p><p>— a specification
    of the biometric evaluation including requirements for test population, test protocols,
    data to record, test results; and</p><p>— procedures for carrying out the overall
    evaluation.</p><p>This document does not:</p><p>— determine which parameters ought
    to be analysed for a specific biometric modality. This is currently covered in
    ISO/IEC TR 19795-3;</p><p>— specify requirements for performing a vulnerability
    analysis modifying user interaction influence factors;</p><p>— include procedures
    for performing usability testing.</p>"
