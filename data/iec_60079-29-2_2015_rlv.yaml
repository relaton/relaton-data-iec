    guidance on, and recommended practice for, the selection, installation, safe use
    and maintenance of electrically operated Group II equipment intended for use in
    industrial and commercial safety applications and Group I equipment in underground
    coal mines for the detection and measurement of flammable gases complying with
    the requirements of IEC 60079-29-1 or IEC 60079-29-4. This second edition cancels
