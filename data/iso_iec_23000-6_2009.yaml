abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23000-6:2009 specifes the professional archival application format
    (PA-AF). The purpose of the PA-AF is to provide a standardized packaging format
    for digital files. This packaging format can also serve as an implementation of
    the information package specified by the reference model of the open archival
    information system (OAIS). The OAIS reference model is a framework for understanding
    and applying concepts necessary for long-term digital information preservation
    (where “long-term” is long enough to be concerned about changing technologies).
    In addition, PA-AF can also be used as an intermediate or exchange packaging format
    for any kind of multimedia content.  While a general archival process may include
    processes starting from creation, to delivery to archival system, and dissemination
    to consumers, PA-AF is limited in scope as follows. PA-AF does not specify how
    input content is created. PA-AF does not specify any agreement of how the content
    should be handled and delivered to the archiving process. PA-AF assumes that input
    content for the archiving process is available in an appropriate digital format.
    PA-AF specifies the format of a digital archive produced by the archival process.
    PA-AF does not specify how the archive output by the archival process is disseminated
    to end-users.  PA-AF specifies a metadata format to describe the original structure
    of digital files archived in a PA-AF file. PA-AF specifies a metadata format to
    describe context information related to a PA-AF file and digital files archived
    in it. PA-AF specifies a metadata format to describe necessary information to
    reverse the pre-processing processes applied to digital files prior to archiving
    them in a PA-AF file. PA-AF specifies a file format for carriage of the metadata
    formats and digital files.
