abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Additional Network Feature
    (ANF) Call Identification and Call Linkage (CIDL),</p><p>which is applicable to
    various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN).
    Basic services are</p><p>specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>ANF-CIDL is an additional
    network feature which allows the identification and correlation of calls throughout
    a PISN by</p><p>assigning unambiguous identifiers to each new call and also, as
    an option, to transformed and logically linked calls.</p><p>NOTE 1 - This ANF
    has been developed to support the use of CSTA (ISO/IEC 18051) in a networked environment,
    i.e. in a PISN. Use of</p><p>this ANF for other applications is not precluded.</p><p>Supplementary
    service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. This</p><p>International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage
    2 specifications of ANF-CIDL. The stage 1 specification (clause 6)</p><p>specifies
    the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause
    7) identifies the Functional Entities</p><p>involved in the supplementary service
    and the information flows between them.</p>"
