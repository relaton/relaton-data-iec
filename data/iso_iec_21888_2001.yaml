abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21888:2001 This International Standard specifies the Additional Network Feature
    (ANF) Call Identification and Call Linkage (CIDL), which is applicable to various
    basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic
    services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nANF-CIDL is an additional network
    feature which allows the identification and correlation of calls throughout a
    PISN by assigning unambiguous identifiers to each new call and also, as an option,
    to transformed and logically linked calls.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 - This ANF has been
    developed to support the use of CSTA (ISO/IEC 18051) in a networked environment,
    i.e. in a PISN. Use of<br />\r\nthis ANF for other applications is not precluded.<br
    />\r\nSupplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according
    to the method described in ETS 300 387. This International Standard contains the
    stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-CIDL. The stage 1 specification (clause
    6) specifies the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification
    (clause 7) identifies the Functional Entities involved in the supplementary service
    and the information flows between them."
