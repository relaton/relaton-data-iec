abstract:
- content: "IEC 63466-1:2025 specifies the general requirements and test methods for
    leaky waveguides, including terms and definitions, design and structure, type
    designation, ratings and characteristics, identification, marking and labelling,
    requirements and test methods, etc.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to leaky
    waveguides, including rigid rectangular leaky waveguides and elliptic leaky waveguides.
    These leaky waveguides are intended for use in tunnels, railways, highways, subways,
    elevators and other installations in which conventional antenna transmission is
    not satisfactory or even impossible."
