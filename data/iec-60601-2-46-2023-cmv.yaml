    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60601-2-46:2023 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60601-2-46:2016<br
    />\r\nedition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 62D experts are provided
    to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of
    the content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-46:2023 specifies safety requirements
    for operating tables, whether or not having electrical parts, including transporters,
    used for the transportation of the operating table top to or from the base or
    pedestal of an operating table with detachable operating table top. This particular
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- dental patient chairs (see ISO 7494-1),<br
    />\r\n- examination chairs and couches,<br />\r\n- patient-supporting systems
    of diagnostic, interventional and therapeutic equipment (see IEC 60601-2-54 or
    IEC 60601-2-43),<br />\r\n- operating table heating blankets (see IEC 60601-2-35),<br
    />\r\n- patient transfer equipment,<br />\r\n- delivery tables and delivery beds,<br
    />\r\n- medical beds (see IEC 60601-2-52 and EN 50637), and<br />\r\n- field tables.<br
    />\r\nIEC 60601-2-46:2023 cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical change with respect to the previous edition: structural
    alignment with IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020."
