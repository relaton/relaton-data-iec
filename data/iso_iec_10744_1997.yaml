abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines a language and underlying model
    for the representation of “hyperdocuments” that link and synchronize static and
    dynamic (time-based) information contained in multiple conventional and multimedia
    documents and information objects. The language is known as the “Hypermedimime-based
    Structuring Language”, or “HyTime”.</p><p>HyTime can represent time in both the
    abstract, or “musical” sense, and in user-defined real-time units. It also provides
    a way of relating the two so that elements of time-dependent documents can be
    synchronized.</p><p>NOTE 7 This facility extends to the representation of multimedia
    information the power, once limited to conventional documents, to distinguish
    intrinsic information content from style considerations.</p><p>HyTime’s techniques
    for representing its time model are equally applicable to spatial and other domains;
    all are treated as systems for measuring along different axes of a coordinate
    space. Arbitrary cross-references and access paths based on external interactions
    (“hypermedia links”) are also supported.</p><p>HyTime’s time representation contains
    sufficient information to derive the durations of both control (“gestural”) data
    (e.g., control information for audio or video hardware) and visual data (e.g.,
    a music score, presentation storyboard, or television script).</p><p>The media
    formats and data notations of objects in a HyTime hyperdocument can include formatted
    and unformatted documents, audio and video segments, still images, and object-oriented
    graphics, among others. Users can specify the positions and sizes of occurrences
    of objects in space and time, using a variety of measurement units and granularities
    Temporal requirements of applications ranging from animation to project management
    can be supported by choosing appropriate measurement granules.</p><p>NOTE 8 This
    International Standard does not address the representation of audio or video content
    data, but simply defines the means by which the start-time and duration of such
    data can be synchronized with other digitized information. Nor does it specify
    the layout process by which occurrences of unformatted documents and other information
    objects can be made to fit the positions and sizes specified for them.</p><p>HyTime
    is an enabling standard, not an encompassing one. AS a result, the objects comprising
    a HyTime hyperdocument are free to conform to any application architectures, or
    to document architectures imposed by standards, and to be represented in any notation
    permitted by those architectures Only the “hub document”, which may determine
    the hyperdocument membership, must conform PO HyTime in addition to any other
    architectures to which it may conform.</p><p>HyTime is designed for flexibility
    and extensibility. Optional subsets can be implemented, alone or in conjunction
    with user-defined extensions.</p><p>The Hypermedia/Time-based Structuring Language
    (HyTime) is an SGML application conforming to International Standard IS0 8879
    - Standard Generalized Markup Language.</p><p>The hyperdocument interchange format
    recommended in this International Standard is IS0 9069, the SGML Document Interchange
    Format (SDIF). SDIF is defined in Abstract Syntax Notation 1 (ISO/IEC 8824) and
    can be encoded according to the basic encoding rules of ISOAEC 8825 for interchange
    using protocols conforming to the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model. Other
    interchange formats can also be used.</p>"
