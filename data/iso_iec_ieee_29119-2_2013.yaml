abstract:
- content: The purpose of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards
    is to define an internationally-agreed set of standards for software testing that
    can be used by any organization when performing any form of software testing.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2:2013 comprises test process descriptions that define the
    software testing processes at the organizational level, test management level
    and dynamic test levels. It supports dynamic testing, functional and non-functional
    testing, manual and automated testing, and scripted and unscripted testing. The
    processes defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2:2013 can be used in conjuntion with
    any software development lifecycle model. Since testing is a key approach to risk-mitigation
    in software development, ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2:2013 follows a risk-based approach
    to testing. Risk-based testing is a common industry approach to strategizing and
    managing testing. Risk-based testing allows testing to be prioritzed and focused
    on the most important features and functions.
