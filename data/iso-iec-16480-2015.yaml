    <p>ISO/IEC 16480:2015 specifies a method to assess the symbol quality rendered on electronic displays (i.e. the symbol produces its own light) when the reading device is a two-dimensional bar code imager.</p>
    <p>In addition, this international standard specifies a method to assess the quality of symbols that are intended to be read with general-purpose cameras in ambient lighting conditions.</p>
    <p>Further, this international standard describes modifications, which are to be considered in conjunction with the symbol quality methodology when applied to a particular symbology specification as defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and ISO/IEC 15416. It defines alternative illumination conditions, display pixel conditions and the reporting of the grading results. This document also describes appropriate ranges of symbol X-dimensions.</p>
