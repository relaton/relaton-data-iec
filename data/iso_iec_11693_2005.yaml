abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11693:2005 is one of a series of standards describing the parameters
    for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage and interchange
    of digital data. It recognizes the existence of different methods for recording
    and reading information on optical memory cards, the characteristics of which
    are specific to the recording method employed. In general, these different recording
    methods will not be compatible with each other. The optical memory card standards
    are structured to accommodate the inclusion of existing and future recording methods
    in a consistent manner and ISO/IEC 11693:2005 is generic to all.   ISO/IEC 11693:2005
    defines the general characteristics of optical memory cards including card materials,
    construction, characteristics, dimensions, and test environments which have been
    determined to be common to all types of optical memory cards regardless of recording
    method employed.   The intent of ISO/IEC 11693:2005 is to provide necessary information
    for card manufacturers, card issuers and card users interested in interchanging
    digital information encoded on optical memory cards.   ISO/IEC 11693:2005 can
    serve as a guide to companies who plan to develop equipment and systems using
    optical memory cards. The data content and use of the cards depend upon the applications
    developed by each industry group.
