abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 11693:2005 is one of a series of standards describing the parameters
    for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage and interchange
    of digital data. It recognizes the existence of different methods for recording
    and reading information on optical memory cards, the characteristics of which
    are specific to the recording method employed. In general, these different recording
    methods will not be compatible with each other. The optical memory card standards
    are structured to accommodate the inclusion of existing and future recording methods
    in a consistent manner and ISO/IEC 11693:2005 is generic to all.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    11693:2005 defines the general characteristics of optical memory cards including
    card materials, construction, characteristics, dimensions, and test environments
    which have been determined to be common to all types of optical memory cards regardless
    of recording method employed.</p><p>The intent of ISO/IEC 11693:2005 is to provide
    necessary information for card manufacturers, card issuers and card users interested
    in interchanging digital information encoded on optical memory cards.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    11693:2005 can serve as a guide to companies who plan to develop equipment and
    systems using optical memory cards. The data content and use of the cards depend
    upon the applications developed by each industry group.</p>"
