    <p>The Document Printing Application is one component of a coordinated set of facilities and standards needed to</p>
    <p>satisfy the printing requirements of the modern distributed office. Together, the capabilities provided can enable</p>
    <p>users to create and produce high-quality office documents in a consistent and unambiguous manner within a</p>
    <p>distributed open systems environment.</p>
    <p>The Document Printing Application Standard (ISO/IEC 10175) consists of three parts:</p>
    <p>Part 1: Abstract service definitions and procedures</p>
    <p>Part 2: Protocol specification</p>
    <p>Part 3: Management abstract service definition and procedures</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10175 extends the facilities specified in ISO/IEC 10175-1 by adding the capability for</p>
    <p>administrators and operators to manage and control printers, print servers and all other print objects; in addition, this</p>
    <p>part specifies additional capabilities for a print client to control a print job. The text and specifications contained in</p>
    <p>this part of ISO/IEC 10175 are derived from IEEE 1387.4 (POSIX) - System Administration Part 4 - Printing</p>
    <p>Interfaces. In particular, this part of ISO/IEC 10175:</p>
    <p>- specifies additional administrative functions and services that may be provided by Document Printing</p>
    <p>Application servers;</p>
    <p>- specifies the Document Printing Application abstract service for the additional administrative functions</p>
    <p>using the principles established by the Abstract Service Definition Conventions (ISO/IEC 10021-3);</p>
    <p>- specifies the requirements for conformance with the Document Printing Application for these additional</p>
    <p>administrative functions.</p>
    <p>See clause 1 of ISO/IEC 10175-1 for a more extensive description of the Document Printing Application.</p>
