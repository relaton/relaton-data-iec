abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 17025:2005 specifies the general requirements for the competence
    to carry out tests and/or calibrations, including sampling. It covers testing
    and calibration performed using standard methods, non-standard methods, and laboratory-developed
    methods.It is applicable to all organizations performing tests and/or calibrations.
    These include, for example, first-, second- and third-party laboratories, and
    laboratories where testing and/or calibration forms part of inspection and product
    certification.ISO/IEC 17025:2005 is applicable to all laboratories regardless
    of the number of personnel or the extent of the scope of testing and/or calibration
    activities. When a laboratory does not undertake one or more of the activities
    covered by ISO/IEC 17025:2005, such as sampling and the design/development of
    new methods, the requirements of those clauses do not apply.ISO/IEC 17025:2005
    is for use by laboratories in developing their management system for quality,
    administrative and technical operations. Laboratory customers, regulatory authorities
    and accreditation bodies may also use it in confirming or recognizing the competence
    of laboratories. ISO/IEC 17025:2005 is not intended to be used as the basis for
    certification of laboratories.Compliance with regulatory and safety requirements
    on the operation of laboratories is not covered by ISO/IEC 17025:2005.
