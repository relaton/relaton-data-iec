abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19500-2:2003 specifies the General Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) for
    object request broker (ORB) interoperability. GIOP can be mapped onto any connection-oriented
    transport protocol that meets a minimal set of assumptions defined by this standard.ISO/IEC
    19500-2:2003 also defines the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol (IIOP), a specific mapping
    of the GIOP which runs directly over connections that use the Internet Protocol
    and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP connections).ISO/IEC 19500-2:2003
    provides a widely implemented and used particularization of ITU-T Rec. X.931  ISO/IEC
    14752. It supports interoperability and location transparency in ODP systems.
