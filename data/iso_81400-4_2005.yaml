abstract:
- content: "ISO 81400-4:2005 establishes the design and specification of gearboxes
    for wind turbines with power capacities ranging from 40 kW to 2MW. It is applicable
    to all such parallel-axis, one-stage epicyclic and combined one-stage epicyclic
    and parallel shaft enclosed gearboxes. Its provisions are based on field experience
    with wind turbines having the above power capacities and configurations; its guidelines
    can be applied to higher capacity wind turbines provided the specifications are
    appropriately modified to accommodate the characteristics of higher capacity wind
    turbines. Life requirements apply to wind turbines with a minimum design lifetime
    of 20 years. The contents of the corrigendum of December 2005 have been included
    in this copy.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is of high relevance for Smart Grid."
