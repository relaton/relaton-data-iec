abstract:
- content: "Low voltage direct current (LVDC) is a disruptive technology that fundamentally
    accelerates energy access and improves energy efficiency. LVDC applications are
    many and varied, and can be applied in every country in the world.<br /><br />\r\nIn
    developed economies, the main drivers for the use of LVDC are the improvement
    of energy efficiency and power quality as well as the conversion to renewable
    energy.<br /><br />\r\nIn developing economies, the standardization of various
    aspects of LVDC is likely to have a profound impact by facilitating electricity
    access in even the remotest of villages.<br /><br />\r\nThis technology report
    examines LVDC in terms of market potential, access to energy, voltage standardization,
    safety and other key considerations. It pools the collective expertise and know-how
    of experts from all around the world.<br /><br />\r\nThe technology report was
    prepared by the IEC SEG 4 on LVDC.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC Technology Report is
    available for free download."
