  content: "IEC 62442-2:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62442-2:2022
    defines a measurement method of the power losses of electromagnetic controlgear,
    the total input power and the standby power of electronic controlgear for discharge
    lamps (excluding low-pressure mercury fluorescent lamps). A calculation method
    of the efficiency of controlgear for discharge lamp(s) is also defined. It is
    assumed that the controlgear are designed for use on DC supplies up to 1 000 V
    and/or AC supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the title of Part 2 has
    been modified;<br />\r\n- this edition has been harmonized with IEC 62442-1 and
    IEC 62442-­3;<br />\r\n- the reference to and use of the measurement methods for
    non-active power consumption in accordance with IEC 63103 have been added."
