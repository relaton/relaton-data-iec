- content: |-
    Specifies the functional requirements for the SCSI Reduced Block
    Command set (RBC). RBC permits SCSI block logical units, such as flexible disks, rigid disks, optical disks, etc., to be attached to computers, and it provides the definition for their use. An implementation guide for RBC devices using SBP-2 is also provided.

    The Reduced Block Command set is designed to provide very efficient initiator-to-device operation of input/output logical units by an operating system.

    The contents of the corrigendum of December 2009 have been included in this copy.
