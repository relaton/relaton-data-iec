abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the
    support of clock synchronization (SYNC-SIG) between Private Integrated Services
    Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services
    Network (PISN).</p><p>This protocol supports the synchronization of a PISN using
    the different sources of clocks available to each PINX. The protocol is based
    on the method of synchronization described in annex F of the International Standard
    ISO/IEC 11573. This International Standard is applicable to PINXs which tan be
    interconnected to form a PISN.</p>"
