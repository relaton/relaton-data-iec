abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of clock
    synchronization (SYNC-SIG) between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges
    (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br
    />\r\nThis protocol supports the synchronization of a PISN using the different
    sources of clocks available to each PINX. The protocol is based on the method
    of synchronization described in annex F of the International Standard ISO/IEC
    11573. This International Standard is applicable to PINXs which tan be interconnected
    to form a PISN."
