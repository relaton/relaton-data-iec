abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 29116-1:2008 specifies a set of protocols to be used in conjunction
    with ISO/IEC 23000-5, in applications where governed audio and video information
    is streamed to an end-user device, named the Media Streaming Player. Media Streaming
    Players can interact with a number of Media Streaming Devices:Content Provider
    Device, a device capable of interacting with a Media Streaming Player to provide
    content;Licence Provider Device, a device capable of interacting with a Media
    Streaming Player to provide licences;IPMP Tool Provider Device, a device capable
    of interacting with a Media Streaming Player to provide IPMP Tools, i.e. modules
    performing one or more functions such as encryption, watermarking, etc.;Domain
    Management Device, a device capable of managing various functions needed for a
    proper functioning of a domain.Two types of protocols are the target of ISO/IEC
    29116-1:2008: the Access Protocols and the Domain Management Protocols. The Access
    Protocols specify how a Media Streaming Player can obtain from another Media Streaming
    Device the following information:a content item or any of its parts, either streamed
    to an end-user device by means of existing protocols such as MPEG-2 Transport
    Stream or Real Time Protocol over Internet Protocol (RTP/IP) or stored in an MPEG-21
    file;a licence, which can grant the Media Streaming Player or its user(s) some
    rights over a content item or any of its parts, possibly under some conditions;executable
    code implementing security functionsThe Domain Management Protocols specify how
    a number of devices and/or users can be grouped in a domain, groups of devices
    or users sharing some common properties. By using domains it becomes possible
    to implement more flexible licensing modalities, e.g. to license content to all
    devices or users in a domain. Domain Management Protocols include the specification
    of technologies for achieving the following goals:creating, renewing or deleting
    a domain; issuing domain membership licences for devices and users;managing devices
    and users memberships of a domain, i.e. joining, renewing and leaving a domain;verifying
    that domain-bound content has been used within the domain according to licence
    terms.'
