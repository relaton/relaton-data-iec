abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29116-1:2008 specifies a set of protocols to be used in conjunction
    with ISO/IEC 23000-5, in applications where governed audio and video information
    is streamed to an end-user device, named the Media Streaming Player.</p><p>Media
    Streaming Players can interact with a number of Media Streaming Devices:</p><ul><li><em>Content
    Provider Device,</em>a device capable of interacting with a Media Streaming Player
    to provide content;</li><li><em>Licence Provider Device,</em>a device capable
    of interacting with a Media Streaming Player to provide licences;</li><li><em>IPMP
    Tool Provider Device,</em>a device capable of interacting with a Media Streaming
    Player to provide IPMP Tools, i.e. modules performing one or more functions such
    as encryption, watermarking, etc.;</li><li><em>Domain Management Device,</em>a
    device capable of managing various functions needed for a proper functioning of
    a domain.</li></ul><p>Two types of protocols are the target of ISO/IEC 29116-1:2008:
    the Access Protocols and the Domain Management Protocols.</p><p>The Access Protocols
    specify how a Media Streaming Player can obtain from another Media Streaming Device
    the following information:</p><ul><li>a content item or any of its parts, either
    streamed to an end-user device by means of existing protocols such as MPEG-2 Transport
    Stream or Real Time Protocol over Internet Protocol (RTP/IP) or stored in an MPEG-21
    file;</li><li>a licence, which can grant the Media Streaming Player or its user(s)
    some rights over a content item or any of its parts, possibly under some conditions;</li><li>executable
    code implementing security functions</li></ul><p>The Domain Management Protocols
    specify how a number of devices and/or users can be grouped in a domain, groups
    of devices or users sharing some common properties. By using domains it becomes
    possible to implement more flexible licensing modalities, e.g. to license content
    to all devices or users in a domain. Domain Management Protocols include the specification
    of technologies for achieving the following goals:</p><ul><li>creating, renewing
    or deleting a domain;</li><li>issuing domain membership licences for devices and
    users;</li><li>managing devices and users memberships of a domain, i.e. joining,
    renewing and leaving a domain;</li><li>verifying that domain-bound content has
    been used within the domain according to licence terms.</li></ul>"
