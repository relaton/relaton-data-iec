abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18014-3:2004 describes time-stamping services producing linked
    tokens, that is, tokens that are cryptographically bound to other tokens produced
    by these time-stamping services. It describes a general model for time-stamping
    services of this type and the basic components used to construct a time-stamping
    service of this type, it defines the data structures and protocols used to interact
    with a time-stamping service of this type, and it describes specific instances
    of such time-stamping services.</p><p>The usage of linking operations reduces
    the level of trust required in the time-stamping service. The trustworthiness
    of linked tokens depends on the integrity of the linking operations carried out
    by the time-stamping service. The integrity of the linking operations performed
    by the time-stamping service can be verified algorithmically. A time-stamping
    service producing linked tokens may publish values derived from the linking operations
    into widely available media to further bind the issued tokens to widely-witnessed
    events and provide additional assurance of integrity. A time-stamping service
    producing linked tokens may also use aggregation operations to bind multiple token
    requests together, thus providing higher throughput through the use of co-operating
    processes. Algorithms applicable to linking, aggregation and publishing operations
    are covered.</p>"
