abstract:
- content: "Data is a valuable tool for smart cities, and standards are effective
    tools in helping cities use data effectively, but a number of concerns remain
    from different standards development organizations (SDOs) regarding their terms
    of references, purposes and scopes of standard projects. What is needed is collaboration
    across SDOs and shared solutions to the issues and challenges of data use in smart
    cities.<br /><br />\r\nThis report provides a summary of the international virtual
    seminar Standards Collaboration on Data Use in Smart Cities hosted by the IEC
    Academy and ISO/IEC JTC 1 on 31 January and 2 February 2024.<br /><br />\r\nThis
