    defines the information model associated with Data Access (DA). It particularly
    includes additional VariableTypes and complementary descriptions of the NodeClasses
    and Attributes needed for Data Access, additional Properties, and other information
    and behaviour. The complete address space model, including all NodeClasses and
    Attributes is specified in IEC 62541‑3. The services to detect and access data
    are specified in IEC 62541‑4. Annex A specifies how the information received from
    OPC COM Data Access (DA) Servers is mapped to the Data Access model. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2020. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    addition of a \"Quantity Model\" which can be referenced from EngineeringUnit
    Properties. The model defines quantities and assigned units. In addition it provides
    alternative units and the conversion to them.<br />\r\nb) addition of rules for
    ValuePrecision Property:<br />\r\n- can also be used for other subtypes like Duration
