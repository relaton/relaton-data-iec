abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 21989:2002 specifies the
    Short Message Service (SMS).</p><p>SMS enables a user to send and receive Short
    Messages (SMs) to and from another user.</p><p>This service is based on GSM 03.40.
    The Service Centre functionality described in ISO/IEC 21989:2002 is equal to the
    functionality of a Service Centre in GSM 03.40. Thus, for interoperability with
    a GSM network, it is only necessary to implement a QSIG interface.</p><p>NOTE
    1 The interworking with other air interfaces is not precluded, but is outside
    the scope of this International Standard.</p><p>NOTE 2 The Short Message Service
    is a special kind of basic service but is described in this document in the style
    of a supplementary service.</p><p>Supplementary service specifications are produced
    in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 21989:2002
    contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SMS. The stage 1 specification
    specifies the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification identifies
    the functional entities involved in the service and the information flows between
    them.</p>
