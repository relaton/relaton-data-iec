abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21989:2002 specifies the Short Message Service (SMS).<br />\r\nSMS enables a user
    to send and receive Short Messages (SMs) to and from another user.<br />\r\nThis
    service is based on GSM 03.40. The Service Centre functionality described in ISO/IEC
    21989:2002 is equal to the functionality of a Service Centre in GSM 03.40. Thus,
    for interoperability with a GSM network, it is only necessary to implement a QSIG
    interface.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The interworking with other air interfaces is not precluded,
    but is outside the scope of this International Standard.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The Short
    Message Service is a special kind of basic service but is described in this document
    in the style of a supplementary service.<br />\r\nSupplementary service specifications
    are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387.
    ISO/IEC 21989:2002 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SMS. The
    stage 1 specification specifies the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage
    2 specification identifies the functional entities involved in the service and
    the information flows between them."
