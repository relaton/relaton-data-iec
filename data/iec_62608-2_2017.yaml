abstract:
- content: IEC 62608-2:2017 specifies the operational model for home network configuration.
    In the home network, various CE devices that have distinctive functions are connected
    on a shared network. However, there is no manager in the home network. Thus, a
    standardized network management procedure is required for suitable network operation.
    This document specifies the management procedure as sequences. The sequences are
    typical procedures of management. This document also describes implementation
    requirements, and the protocols between each component.
