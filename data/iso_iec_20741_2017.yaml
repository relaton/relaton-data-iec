abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 20741:2017 gives guidelines for the evaluation and selection
    of software engineering tools, covering a partial or full portion of the software
    engineering life cycle.</p><p>It establishes processes and activities to be applied
    for the evaluation of software engineering tools and selecting the most appropriate
    software engineering tools from several candidates.</p><p>It establishes, for
    selected processes, the tasks and activities that can be applied for the evaluation
    of software engineering tools and selecting the most appropriate software engineering
    tools from several candidates.</p><p>It establishes processes that can be applied
    for the evaluation of software engineering tools and selecting the most appropriate
    software engineering tools from several candidates.</p><p>As these processes are
    generic, organizations can adapt these generic processes to meet organizational
    needs. The software engineering tool evaluation and selection processes can be
    viewed in the larger context of the organization's technology adoption process.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    20741:2017 provides the following:</p><p>a) guidance on identifying organizational
    requirements for software engineering tools;</p><p>b) guidance on mapping those
    requirements to software engineering tool characteristics to be evaluated;</p><p>c)
    a process for selecting the most appropriate software engineering tool from several
    tools, based on measurements of the defined characteristics.</p><p>NOTE 1 Guidance
    on mapping those requirements to software engineering tool capabilities to be
    evaluated is not covered by this document, but is covered by a series of standards
    for each tool area.</p><p>Primary users of this document are organizations that
    intend to adopt software engineering tools to support their software life cycle
    processes. Software tool suppliers can also use this document to describe characteristics
    of their software engineering tools.</p><p>ISO/IEC 20741:2017 is not intended
    to apply to:</p><p>a) software engineering frameworks whose purpose is to provide
    mechanisms for data, control and presentation integration;</p><p>b) general purpose
    tools (e.g. word processors, spreadsheets) which can be used in software engineering
    activities, nor software engineering tools of very narrow scope or specific purpose
    (e.g. a compiler);</p><p>c) planning for the implementation of software engineering
    tools within an organization.</p><p>NOTE 2 A user of this document can make the
    best possible selection of a software engineering tool and yet have no guarantee
    of a successful implementation.</p><p>The methods described in this document are
    useful not only for the selection of software engineering tools, but for any project
    where COTS/FOSS software can be selected instead of engaging in new software development.</p><p>To
    follow the guidance provided in this document consists in applying the activities
    and tasks that are attached to the defined processes to evaluate and select software.
    Organizations using this document for trade purposes can specify the minimum set
    of processes and their related activities and tasks, suitable to their given application.</p>"
