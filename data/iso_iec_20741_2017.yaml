abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20741:2017 gives guidelines for the evaluation and selection of
    software engineering tools, covering a partial or full portion of the software
    engineering life cycle.<br />\r\nIt establishes processes and activities to be
    applied for the evaluation of software engineering tools and selecting the most
    appropriate software engineering tools from several candidates.<br />\r\nIt establishes,
    for selected processes, the tasks and activities that can be applied for the evaluation
    of software engineering tools and selecting the most appropriate software engineering
    tools from several candidates.<br />\r\nIt establishes processes that can be applied
    for the evaluation of software engineering tools and selecting the most appropriate
    software engineering tools from several candidates.<br />\r\nAs these processes
    are generic, organizations can adapt these generic processes to meet organizational
    needs. The software engineering tool evaluation and selection processes can be
    viewed in the larger context of the organization's technology adoption process.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 20741:2017 provides the following:<br />\r\na) guidance on identifying
    organizational requirements for software engineering tools;<br />\r\nb) guidance
    on mapping those requirements to software engineering tool characteristics to
    be evaluated;<br />\r\nc) a process for selecting the most appropriate software
    engineering tool from several tools, based on measurements of the defined characteristics.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 Guidance on mapping those requirements to software engineering tool
    capabilities to be evaluated is not covered by this document, but is covered by
    a series of standards for each tool area.<br />\r\nPrimary users of this document
    are organizations that intend to adopt software engineering tools to support their
    software life cycle processes. Software tool suppliers can also use this document
    to describe characteristics of their software engineering tools.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20741:2017 is not intended to apply to:<br />\r\na) software engineering frameworks
    whose purpose is to provide mechanisms for data, control and presentation integration;<br
    />\r\nb) general purpose tools (e.g. word processors, spreadsheets) which can
    be used in software engineering activities, nor software engineering tools of
    very narrow scope or specific purpose (e.g. a compiler);<br />\r\nc) planning
    for the implementation of software engineering tools within an organization.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 A user of this document can make the best possible selection of a
    software engineering tool and yet have no guarantee of a successful implementation.<br
    />\r\nThe methods described in this document are useful not only for the selection
    of software engineering tools, but for any project where COTS/FOSS software can
    be selected instead of engaging in new software development.<br />\r\nTo follow
    the guidance provided in this document consists in applying the activities and
    tasks that are attached to the defined processes to evaluate and select software.
    Organizations using this document for trade purposes can specify the minimum set
    of processes and their related activities and tasks, suitable to their given application."
