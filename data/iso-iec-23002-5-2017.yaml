    <p>ISO/IEC 23002-5:2017 describes:</p>
    <p>-      what is meant by conformance of what is specified in ISO/IEC 23002‑4,</p>
    <p>-      the structure of the reference software related to what is specified in ISO/IEC 23002‑4.</p>
    <p>Currently the following profiles are included in ISO/IEC 23002‑4 and in this document as reference software:</p>
    <p>-      ISO/IEC 14496‑2 Simple Profile,</p>
    <p>-      ISO/IEC 14496‑10 Constrained Baseline Profile,</p>
    <p>-      ISO/IEC 14496‑10 Progressive High Profile,</p>
    <p>-      ISO/IEC 14496‑16 SC3DMC, and</p>
    <p>-      ISO/IEC 23008‑2 Main Profile.</p>
    <p>NOTE       The reference software supports the decoding of bitstreams that conform to the Main Profile of ISO/IEC 23008‑2, but does not support display-related features indicated in supplemental enhancement information (the support for which is a display capability that is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 23008‑2).</p>
