  content: "IEC 63171-4:2022 covers shielded and unshielded free and fixed multimedia
    connectors (MMC) for data transmission with frequencies up to and above 3 000
    MHz for shielded and up to 600 MHz for unshielded connectors, both with current-carrying
    capacity with up to 8 ways. It specifies the common dimensions, mechanical, electrical
    and transmission characteristics and environmental requirements as well as test
    specifications, respectively. The form factor of these connectors allows their
    use for cable sharing with TOs (Telecommunications Outlet) for structured cabling.
    This document covers type 4 connectors. Each part of this series has the associated
    type number equal to the number of the part in the series. All connectors in the
    IEC 63171 series are deemed to provide the same functions as defined in IEC 63171,
    using different mechanical interfaces. The shielded and unshielded connectors
    are interoperable for their internal transmission performance and can be exchanged.
    The shielded version has improved EMC and coupling properties. The connectors
    are intended to be used for Single Pair Ethernet (SPE) according, but not restricted
    to the following IEEE standards: 10Base-T1 (IEEE 802.3cg), 100Base-T1 (IEEE 802.3bw),
    1000Base-T1 (IEEE 802.3bp), Multi-Gig Base-T1 (IEEE 802.3ch) and optionally with
    Power over Data line (PoDL) power supply according to IEEE 802.3bu.</br>\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum 1 (2023-08) have been included in this copy."
