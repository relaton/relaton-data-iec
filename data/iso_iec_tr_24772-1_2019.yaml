abstract:
- content: "This document specifies software programming language vulnerabilities
    to be avoided in the development of systems where assured behaviour is required
    for security, safety, mission-critical and business-critical software. Language-specific
    descriptions of these vulnerabilities are provided in other parts of the ISO/IEC
    24772 series.<br />\r\nIt is applicable to the software developed, reviewed, or
    maintained for any application.<br />\r\nThis document does not address software
    engineering and management issues such as how to design and implement programs,
    use configuration management tools, use managerial processes, and perform process
    improvement. Furthermore, the specification of properties and applications to
    be assured are not treated.<br />\r\nVulnerabilities are described in a generic
    manner that is applicable to a broad range of programming languages."
