abstract:
- content: IEC 63501-2416:2023 describes a parameterized and abstracted power model
    enabling system, software, and hardware intellectual property (IP)-centric power
    analysis and optimization. It defines concepts for the development of parameterized,
    accurate, efficient, and complete power models for systems and hardware IP blocks
    usable for system power analysis and optimization. These concepts include, but
    are not limited to, process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) independence; power
    and thermal management interface; and workload and architecture parameterization.
    This standard also defines the necessary requirements for the information content
    of parameterized, accurate, efficient, and complete power models to help guide
    development and usage of other related power, workload, and functional modeling
    standards. This standard is published as a double logo IEC-IEEE standard.
