abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5:2016 defines an efficient and consistent solution
    for Keyword-Driven Testing by:</p><ul><li> giving an introduction to Keyword-Driven
    Testing;</li><li> providing a reference approach to implement Keyword-Driven Testing;</li><li>
    defining requirements on frameworks for Keyword-Driven Testing to enable testers
    to share their work items, such as test cases, test data, keywords, or complete
    test specifications;</li><li> defining requirements for tools that support Keyword-Driven
    Testing. These requirements could apply to any tool that supports the Keyword-Driven
    approach (e.g., test automation, test design and test management tools);</li><li>
    defining interfaces and a common data exchange format to ensure that tools from
    different vendors can exchange their data (e.g. test cases, test data and test
    results);</li><li> defining levels of hierarchical keywords, and advising use
    of hierarchical keywords. This includes describing specific types of keywords
    (e.g. keywords for navigation or for checking a value) and when to use "flat"
    structured keywords;</li><li> providing an initial list of example generic technical
    (low-level) keywords, such as "inputData" or "checkValue". These keywords can
    be used to specify test cases on a technical level, and may be combined to create
    business-level keywords as required.</li></ul><p>NOTE This standard is applicable
    to all those who want to create keyword-driven test specifications, create corresponding
    frameworks, or build test automation based on keywords.</p>
