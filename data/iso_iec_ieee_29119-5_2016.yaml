abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5:2016 defines an efficient and consistent solution
    for Keyword-Driven Testing by:\r\n\r\n\tgiving an introduction to Keyword-Driven
    Testing;\r\n\tproviding a reference approach to implement Keyword-Driven Testing;\r\n\tdefining
    requirements on frameworks for Keyword-Driven Testing to enable testers to share
    their work items, such as test cases, test data, keywords, or complete test specifications;\r\n\tdefining
    requirements for tools that support Keyword-Driven Testing. These requirements
    could apply to any tool that supports the Keyword-Driven approach (e.g., test
    automation, test design and test management tools);\r\n\tdefining interfaces and
    a common data exchange format to ensure that tools from different vendors can
    exchange their data (e.g. test cases, test data and test results);\r\n\tdefining
    levels of hierarchical keywords, and advising use of hierarchical keywords. This
    includes describing specific types of keywords (e.g. keywords for navigation or
    for checking a value) and when to use \"flat\" structured keywords;\r\n\tproviding
    an initial list of example generic technical (low-level) keywords, such as \"inputData\"
    or \"checkValue\". These keywords can be used to specify test cases on a technical
    level, and may be combined to create business-level keywords as required.<p>NOTE
    This standard is applicable to all those who want to create keyword-driven test
    specifications, create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation based
    on keywords.</p>"
