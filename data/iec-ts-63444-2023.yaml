  content: "IEC TS 63444:2023 is applicable to process automation equipment using
    a 10BASE-T1L compliant (see IEEE Std 802.3-2022, Clause 146) Physical Layer (PHY).
    Ethernet-APL intrinsically safe profiles with different predefined entity or limitation
    parameters (for example voltage, current, power, capacitance, inductance, cable
    length) simplify the examination of the interconnection of different Ethernet-APL
    ports.<br />\r\nThe following technical features are part of this document:<br
    />\r\n- topology with trunk/spur installation capability;<br />\r\n- 2-wire technology
    (full-duplex communication data rate of 10 Mbit/s);<br />\r\n- long distance (refers
    to cable lengths of several hundred meters, with spans up to 1 000 m);<br />\r\n-
    intrinsic safety (installation of Ethernet-capable field devices in hazardous
    areas);<br />\r\n- power supply to field devices over the same 2-wire cable used
    for data communication."
