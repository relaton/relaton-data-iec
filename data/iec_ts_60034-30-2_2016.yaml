abstract:
- content: IEC TS 60034-30-2:2016(E) specifies efficiency classes for variable speed
    rotating electric machines not covered in IEC 60034-30-1. The classification only
    covers machines designed for operation with sinusoidal fundamental current that
    are not designed to be operated direct on-line (grid), for example permanent magnet
    synchronous machines with and without additional reluctance torque, sinusoidal
    reluctance synchronous machines and synchronous machines with DC field windings.
