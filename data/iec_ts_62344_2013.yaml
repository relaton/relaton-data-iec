abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62344:2013(E) applies to the design of earth electrode stations
    for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links. It is intended to provide necessary
    guidelines, limits, and precautions to be followed during the design of earth
    electrodes to ensure safety of personnel and earth electrodes and prevent any
    significant impact they may exert on d.c. power transmission systems and the surrounding
    environment. This technical specification cancels and replaces IEC/PAS 62344 published
    in 2007. This first edition constitutes a technical revision.
