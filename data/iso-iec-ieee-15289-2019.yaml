    <p>This document specifies the purpose and content of all identified systems and software life‐cycle and service management information items (documentation). The information item contents are defined according to generic document types, as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of the document, as presented in Clause 10.</p>
    <p>This document assumes an organization is performing life‐cycle processes, or delivering system or software engineering services, using either or both of the following:</p>
    <p>—          ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 software life cycle processes;</p>
    <p>—          ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 system life cycle processes.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 define an Information Management process, but do not "detail information items in terms of name, format, explicit content, and recording media" (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 1.4). These standards identify, recommend or require a number of documentation items. This document provides a mapping of processes from the above standards to a set of information items. It provides a consistent approach to meeting the information and documentation requirements of systems and software engineering and engineering service management.</p>
    <p>The generic document types defined in this document are used to identify the information necessary to support the processes required by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. The generic document types (which can be referred to as information item types) are used to identify the information necessary to support the processes.</p>
    <p>For each life‐cycle process or service, it would be possible to prepare a policy, plan, procedures and reports, as well as numerous records, requests, descriptions and specifications. Such an elaboration of the documentation schema would be more rigorous than specified by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. As ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, 1.4 points out, "The users of this document are responsible for selecting a life cycle model for the project and mapping the processes, activities, and tasks in this document into that model. The parties are also responsible for selecting and applying appropriate methodologies, methods, models and techniques suitable for the project." Thus, information items are combined or subdivided consistent with the life cycle model, as needed for project or organizational purposes, as further defined in Clause 4 and Clause 5.</p>
    <p>This document is not a management system standard and does not establish a service management system, quality management system, or asset management system. The scope of this document does not include the following:</p>
    <p>a)    the format or content of recommended input data or input information items, except for the content of those input items that are also output information items;</p>
    <p>b)    instructions on combining or subdividing information items and information item contents of a similar nature;</p>
    <p>c)    guidance on selecting an appropriate presentation format, delivery media and maintenance technology for systems or software life‐cycle data, records, information items or documentation, such as electronic publishing systems, content management systems or data repositories;</p>
    <p>NOTE       ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531 provides requirements for content management and component content management systems. ISO/IEC 26514 provides guidance on formats for user documentation (information for users).</p>
    <p>d)    detailed content for information items related to general business, contractual, organizational and financial management that is not specific to systems and software engineering and engineering service management, such as business strategies, contract change notices (agreement change report), human resources and investment policies, personnel selection criteria, financial budgeting and accounting policies and procedures, cost reports, or payroll data;</p>
    <p>e)    information items showing only approval of an ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 subclause, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.10.3 c) 3);</p>
    <p>f)     any ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 subclause not explicitly or implicitly identifying the recording of information about a process, activity or task, for example, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.2.4.3 c);</p>
    <p>g)    work products, models, software, and other artifacts of life‐cycle products and services that are not information items or records used in information items.</p>
