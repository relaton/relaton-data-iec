  content: "IEC 60317-27-4:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of paper
    tape covered rectangular aluminium winding wires. This covering consists of two
    or more layers of paper tape and is primarily intended for winding coils for oil
    immersed transformers. The range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this
    document is:<br />\r\n- width: min. 2,00 mm max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness:
    min. 0,80 mm max. 5,60 mm.<br />\r\nThe paper tapes included in this document
    are restricted to those specified in IEC 60554-1 and IEC 60554-3-5."
