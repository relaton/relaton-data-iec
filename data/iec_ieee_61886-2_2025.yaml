abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 61886-2:2025 is applicable to three-phase and single-phase liquid
    immersed subsea power transformers (including auto-transformers) with at least
    one winding with rated voltages in the range 3,6 ≤ Um ≤ 245 kV and with rated
    power in the range 50 kVA to 300 MVA. The intention is to specify additional requirements
    that are not covered by the IEC 60076 series and IEEE Std C57.12TM series.<br
    />\r\nThis document is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo standard.<br />\r\nThis
