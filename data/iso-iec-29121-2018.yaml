    <p>ISO/IEC 29121:2018 specifies the data migration method for DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, +R, +RW, CD-R, CD-RW, BD Recordable and BD Rewritable disks for long-term data storage. By applying this document for information storage, digital data can be migrated to a next new disk without loss from the present disk as long as data errors are completely corrected before and during the migration and provided copying of the data is allowed.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29121:2018 specifies:</p>
    <p>-      a data migration method for long-term data storage;</p>
    <p>-      test methods including test parameters, test area, test drive, disk preparation and test execution;</p>
    <p>-      an initial performance test and a periodic performance test that check a readability of the data recorded on the disks with categorized Maximum Data Error tables; and</p>
    <p>-      a necessity of precaution to reduce the possibility of deterioration in order to assure the integrity of the disks during their use, storage, handling or transportation.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29121:2018 offers guidelines to use disks with estimated lifetime of Bmig (B0,000 1) Life which is introduced using B5 Life and B50 Life specified in ISO/IEC 16963.</p>
