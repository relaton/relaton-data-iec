  content: "IEC TS 62257-9-7:2019 specifies the criteria for selecting and sizing
    inverters suitable for different off-grid applications integrating solar as an
    energy source.<br />\r\nAs well as off-grid system, this document can also apply
    to inverters where a utility grid connection is available as a backup for charging
    batteries, but it is not intended to cover applications in which inverters synchronize
    and inject energy back into a utility grid, even though this capability may incidentally
    be a part of the functionality of the inverters. Single and multi-phase applications
    are included."
