abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-20-3:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [14]. It defines a device type referred to herein as MediaServer.</p><p>The
    MediaServer specification defines a general-purpose device that can be used to
    instantiate any Consumer Electronics (CE) device that provides AV content (for
    example, media) to other UPnP devices on the home network. It is based on the
    UPnP AV Architecture Framework (described in another document). It exposes its
    content via the ContentDirectory service (refer to the ContentDirectory service
    specification for details). The MediaServer may also provide functionality to
    record content using the ScheduledRecording service (refer to the ScheduledRecording
    service specification). As such, the MediaServer can handle any specific type
    of media, any data format, and transfer protocol.</p><p>Example instances of a
    MediaServer include traditional devices such as VCRs, CD Players, DVD Players,
    audio-tape players, still-image cameras, camcorders, radios, TV Tuners, and set-top
    boxes. Additional examples of a MediaServer also include new digital devices such
    as MP3 servers, PVRs, smartphones and Home MediaServers such as the PC. Although
    these devices contain diverse (AV) content in one form or another, the MediaServer
    (via the ContentDirectory service) is able to expose this content to the home
    network in a uniform and consistent manner. This ability allows the MediaServer
    to instantiate traditional single-function devices as well as more recent multi-function
    devices such as VCR-DVD players and the general purpose Home MediaServer, which
    contains a wide variety of content such as MPEG2 video, CD audio, MP3 and/or WMA
    audio, JPEG images, etc.</p><p>The MediaServer specification is very lightweight
    and can easily be implemented on low-resource devices such as still-image cameras
    or MP3 players that want to expose their local content to the home network. The
    MediaServer can also be used for high-end Home MediaServers that contain dozens
    of Gigabytes of heterogeneous content. Refer to the Theory Of Operation subclause
    for some specific examples of the MediaServer.</p>"
