abstract:
- content: Applies to those components of X-ray equipment which - generate, influence
    the propagation of, and detect X-radiation; and - process, present and store radiographic
    information in radiological installations with diagnostic X-ray systems using
    radiographic films in direct radiography. This standard defines - the essential
    parameters which describe or affect the performance of the above components of
    X-ray equipment; - methods of checking that variations in measured quantities
    related to those parameters are within acceptable limits, in order to maintain
    adequate standards of imaging whilst reducing unnecessary irradiation of the patient.
