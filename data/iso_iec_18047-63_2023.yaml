abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18047-63:2023 This document specficies test methods for determining
    the conformance of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (tags and interrogators)
    for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-63.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar
    requirements.<br />\r\nThe test methods specify only the verification of the mandatory
    functions and any optional functions which are implemented. This can, in appropriate
    circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality
    criteria that are not available in the general case.<br />\r\nThe interrogator
    and tag conformance parameters in this document are the following:<br />\r\n-
    type-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;<br
    />\r\n- parameters that directly affect system functionality and inter-operability.<br
    />\r\nParameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements are
    not included in this document.<br />\r\nUnless otherwise specified, the tests
    in this document are intended to be applied exclusively to RFID tags and interrogators
    defined in ISO/IEC 18000-63."
