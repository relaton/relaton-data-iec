  content: IEC TS 63109:2022 specifies a method to measure the diode ideality factor
    of photovoltaic cells and modules by quantitative analysis of electroluminescence
    (EL) images. This document provides a definition of the term diode ideality factor
    <em>n</em>, as the inverse of increment ratio of natural logarithm of current
    as a function of applied voltage, which is related to the fill factor <em>FF</em>,
    and is useful as an effective indicator to represent the output efficiency of
    photovoltaic cells and modules with the other key parameters open circuit voltage
    <em>V</em>oc and short circuit current <em>I</em>sc.
