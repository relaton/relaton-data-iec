abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63472:2023 describes dimensional options for CONFIGURATION FF AC/DC
    contact-tube vehicle couplers as defined in IEC 62196-3. These possibilities serve
    to improve the reliability of a mated connection when the charging cable is not
    axially constrained. The options can be implemented optionally and maintain mating
    compatibility with CONFIGURATION FF according to IEC 62196-3.
