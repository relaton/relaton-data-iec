abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017 establishes:<br />\r\n- principles and methods for
    performance assessment of presentation attack detection mechanisms;<br />\r\n-
    reporting of testing results from evaluations of presentation attack detection
    mechanisms;<br />\r\n- a classification of known attack types (in an informative
    annex).<br />\r\nOutside the scope are:<br />\r\n- standardization of specific
    PAD mechanisms;<br />\r\n- detailed information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing
    techniques), algorithms, or sensors;<br />\r\n- overall system-level security
    or vulnerability assessment.<br />\r\nThe attacks considered in this document
    take place at the sensor during presentation. Any other attacks are considered
    outside the scope of this document."
