abstract:
- content: Reflects the most important terms used in International Standards after
    the publication of IEC 62051 in 1999. The new terms are mainly related to data
    exchange with metering equipment for meter reading, tariff and load control using
    DLMS/COSEM as specified in the IEC 62056 series of standards. The contents of
    the corrigendum of June 2006 have been included in this copy.<br /><br />This
    publication is of high relevance for Smart Grid.
