    <p>1          This document specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the C</p>
    <p>programming language.1) It specifies</p>
    <p>- the representation of C programs;</p>
    <p>- the syntax and constraints of the C language;</p>
    <p>- the semantic rules for interpreting C programs;</p>
    <p>- the representation of input data to be processed by C programs;</p>
    <p>- the representation of output data produced by C programs;</p>
    <p>- the restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C.</p>
    <p>2              This document does not specify</p>
    <p>- the mechanism by which C programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;</p>
    <p>- the mechanism by which C programs are invoked for use by a data-processing system;</p>
    <p>- the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C program;</p>
    <p>- the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C program;</p>
    <p>- the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific</p>
    <p>data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;</p>
    <p>- all minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming</p>
    <p>implementation.</p>
