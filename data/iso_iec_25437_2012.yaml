abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25437:2012 specifies Web Services (in WSDL, in Clause 5) and
    SOAP bindings (in Clause 6) for the Application Session Services defined in ISO/IEC
    22534. The Application Session Services allow Applications to create and maintain
    a relationship with Servers termed Application Session. The Web services specified
    herein, allow Service Requesters (Applications in ISO/IEC 22534) and Service Providers
    (Servers in ISO/IEC 22534) to create and maintain such Application Sessions.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    25437:2012 builds upon and imports the XML schema definitions from ISO/IEC 22534.
    The method of making the WSDL description of the specified services available
    to Service Provider and Requester is out of the scope of ISO/IEC 25437:2012.</p><p>The
    Notification WSDL specifies the ApplicationSessionTerminated operation. The operation
    specifies one input message for the event notification that Service Requesters
    receive from the Service Provider. Service Requesters may also receive the event
    notifications from web services, e.g. ECMA-348, that use ISO/IEC 25437:2012 for
    session management.</p>"
