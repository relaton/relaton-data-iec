abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-6:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60404-6:2018 specifies
    methods for the measurement of AC magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials,
    other than electrical steels and soft ferrites, in the frequency range 20 Hz to
    100 kHz. The materials covered by this part of IEC 60404 include those speciality
    alloys listed in IEC 60404-8-6, amorphous and nano-crystalline soft magnetic materials,
    pressed and sintered and metal injection moulded parts such as are listed in IEC
    60404-8-9, cast parts and magnetically soft composite materials. The object of
    this part is to define the general principles and the technical details of the
    measurement of the magnetic properties of magnetically soft materials by means
    of ring methods. For materials supplied in powder form, a ring test specimen is
    formed by the appropriate pressing method for that material. The measurement of
    the DC magnetic properties of soft magnetic materials is made in accordance with
    the ring method of IEC 60404-4. The determinations of the magnetic characteristics
    of magnetically soft components are made in accordance with IEC 62044-3. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) adaption to modern measurement and evaluation methods,
    in particular the introduction of the widely spread digital sampling method for
    the acquisition and evaluation of the measured data;<br />\r\nb)limitation of
    the frequency range up to 100 kHz;<br />\r\nc) deletion of Clause 7 of the second
    edition that specified the measurement of magnetic properties using a digital
    impedance bridge;<br />\r\nd) addition of a new Clause 7 on the measurement of
    the specific total loss by the wattmeter method, including an example of the application
    of the digital sampling method;<br />\r\ne) addition of an informative annex on
    the technical details of the digital sampling technique for the determination
    of magnetic properties.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of November 2018
    have been included in this copy.</p>"
