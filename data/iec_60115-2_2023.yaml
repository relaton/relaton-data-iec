abstract:
- content: "IEC 60115-2:2023(E) is applicable to fixed low-power film resistors with
    termination leads for use in electronic equipment, which are typically assembled
    in through-hole technology (THT) on circuit boards.<br />\r\nThese resistors are
    typically described according to types (different geometric shapes) and styles
    (different dimensions) and product technology. The resistive element of these
    resistors is typically protected by a conformal lacquer coating. These resistors
    have wire terminations and are primarily intended to be mounted on a circuit board
    in through-hole technique.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is to state preferred
    ratings and characteristics and to select from IEC 60115-1 the appropriate quality
    assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance
    requirements for this type of resistor.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tthe
    definitions of product technologies and product classification levels of the generic
    specification, IEC 60115‑1:2020, have been adopted;\r\n\tthe preferred dimensions
    given in Table 1 have been reviewed, and the legacy style RA_0922 has been removed;\r\n\ta
    basis for the optional specification of the lead eccentricity of axial leaded
    resistors has been amended in 4.2;\r\n\tthe 'period-pulse high-voltage overload
    test' of IEC 60115‑1:2020, 8.3 has been adopted as default test method in 5.3.8,
    thereby replacing the legacy test 'periodic-pulse overload test' of IEC 60115‑1:2020,
    8.4;\r\n\tthe revised solderability test of IEC 60115‑1:2020, 11.1 has been adopted
    in 5.3.19 and 5.3.20;\r\n\tthe combined solvent resistance test of IEC 60115‑1:2020,
    11.3 has been adopted in 5.3.22;\r\n\tthe 'endurance at room temperature test'
    of IEC 60115‑1:2020, 7.2 (prior IEC 60115 2:2014, Annex C) has been adopted as
    an optional test in 5.4.1;\r\n\tthe 'single-pulse high-voltage overload test'
    of IEC 60115 1:2020, 8.2, applied with the pulse shape 10/700 in 5.3.7, is complemented
    with the optional alternative provided by the pulse shape 1,2/50 in 5.4.2;\r\n\tclimatic
    tests for 'operation at low temperature' of IEC 60115‑1:2020, 10.2, and for 'damp
    heat, steady state, accelerated' of IEC 60115‑1:2020, 10.5, have been adopted
    as optional tests in 5.4.4 and 5.4.5, respectively;\r\n\tnew guidance is provided
    in 6.2 on the presentation of stability requirements with their permissible absolute
    and relative deviations;\r\n\tacceptance criteria for the visual examination have
    been added in 6.5 and in Annex B;\r\n\tvisual examination for the primary and
    proximity packaging has been added in 6.5.2 and in 7.2;\r\n\tthe periodical evaluation
    of termination platings has been added as a new topic of quality assessment in
    9.8;\r\n\tthe revised test clause numbering of IEC 60115‑1:2020 has been applied;\r\n\ta
    new Annex C has been added to summarize workmanship requirements for the assembly
    of leaded film resistors, e.g. as given in the prior IEC 61192 series of standards;\r\n\tthe
    informative Annex F (prior Annex B) on radial formed styles has been amended with
    details on a formed Z-bend style for surface-mount assembly."
