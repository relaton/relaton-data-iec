abstract:
- content: 'IEC 60728-11:2010(E) deals with the safety requirements applicable to
    fixed sited systems and equipment. As far as applicable, it is also valid for
    mobile and temporarily installed systems, for example, caravans. Additional requirements
    may be applied. It is intended to provide specifically for the safety of the system,
    personnel working on it, subscribers and subscriber equipment. It deals only with
    safety aspects and is not intended to define a standard for the protection of
    the equipment used in the system. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision
    and includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition: The list of "differences in some countries" was transferred from the
    "Foreword" to informative Annex D. Some new terms and definitions were added.
    All Figures were reworked among other things concerning equipotential bonding
    and earthing details and were incorporated in the text at the appropriate places.
    Clause 11 "Protection against atmospheric overvoltages and elimination of potential
    differences" was completely reworked and re-structured taking into account among
    other things the provisions and requirements of the IEC 62305 series on "Lightning
    protection". New informative Annex A on "Earth loop impedance" was added. New
    informative Annex C on "Examples of calculation of risk due to lightning" was
    added. Former Annex B on "Special conditions using IT power line networks" was
    re-worded and incorporated in Annex D as "Difference in Norway".'
