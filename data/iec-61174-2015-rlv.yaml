  content: "IEC 61174:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61174:2015(E) specifies
    the performance requirements, methods of testing and required test results of
    equipment conforming to performance standards not inferior to those adopted by
    the IMO in resolution MSC.232(82). This standard is based upon the performance
    standards of IMO resolution MSC.232(82), and is also associated with IMO resolution
    A.694(17) and IEC 60945. Reference is made, where appropriate, to IMO resolution
    MSC.232(82), and all subclauses whose wording is identical to that in the resolution
    are printed in italics. The requirements of this standard are not intended to
    prevent the use of new techniques in equipment and systems, provided the facilities
    offered are not inferior to those stated. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    updated references are provided to IHO publications and test methods are updated
    to IHO test data sets;<br />\r\n- requirements have been added for display of
    radar and AIS information;<br />\r\n- new interface requirements have been added
    for BNWAS, VDR, BAM, MSI, INS and route transfer;<br />\r\n- a requirement for
    an anchor watch has been added;<br />\r\n- additional test methods are specified
    for operation of ECDIS beyond the normal range between 85 degrees South latitude
    and 85 degrees North latitude."
