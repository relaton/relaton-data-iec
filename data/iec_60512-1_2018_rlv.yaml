abstract:
- content: "IEC 60512-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60512-1:2018 is intended
    to be used as a basis for tests and measurements specifications for electrical
    connectors. It provides guidance and reference for tests and measurements within
    the IEC 60512 series. It includes the description and the practice of the various
    phases of tests and measurements (preparation, tests and measurements, requirements,
    documentation), in addition to basic terms and definitions applicable to any part
    of the IEC 60512 series. This standard shall be used in conjunction with IEC 60512-1-101
    and relevant part(s) of series IEC 60512. Part 60512-1-100 provides the list of
    the existing test and measuring methods published within series IEC 60512. Detail
    tests and measurements specifications are applicable to electrical connectors
    and their components (e.g. connector inserts, connector housings, locking mechanisms,
    contacts and terminations) within the scope of technical committee 48. They may
    also be used for similar devices when specified in a detail product specification.
    Detail tests and measurements specifications are used in conjunction with detail
    product specifications which prescribe the tests to be used, the required degree
    of severity for each of them and the permissible performance limits. The detail
    product specification also specifies the deviations in procedures, which may be
    required when applying a test to the type of connector or its component under
    consideration, and it further specifies any special procedures which may be required.
    This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition, published in 2001.
    It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following main
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n– in Clause 3,
    only terms relating to the testing are defined, and IEC 61076-1 is referred to
    for terms of connectors.<br />\r\n– Clause 4 (Numbering of tests and measurement
    specification) is added.<br />\r\n– Subclause 5.1.2 (Calibration) is added.<br
    />\r\n– in Clause 6 (Test), test procedure follows IEC 60068-1.<br /><br />\r\nKey
