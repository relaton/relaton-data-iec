  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 14496-24:2008 describes the desired joint behavior of MPEG-4
    Systems (MPEG-4 File Format) and MPEG-4 Audio codecs. It is desired that MPEG-4
    Audio encoders and decoders permit finite length signals to be encoded to a file
    (particularly MPEG-4 files) and decoded again to obtain the identical signal,
    subject to codec distortions. This will allow the use of audio in systems implementations
    (particularly MPEG-4 Systems), perhaps with other media such as video, in a deterministic
    fashion. Most importantly, the decoded signal will have nothing “extra” at the
    beginning or “missing” at the end.</p>"
