abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 42030:2019 This document specifies the means to organize
    and record architecture evaluations for enterprise, systems and software fields
    of application.<br />\r\nThe aim of this document is to enable architecture evaluations
    that are used to:<br />\r\na) validate that architectures address the concerns
    of stakeholders;<br />\r\nb) assess the quality of architectures with respect
    to their intended purpose;<br />\r\nc) assess the value of architectures to their
    stakeholders;<br />\r\nd) determine whether architecture entities address their
    intended purpose;<br />\r\ne) provide knowledge and information about architecture
    entities;<br />\r\nf) assess progress towards achieving architecture objectives;<br
    />\r\ng) clarify understanding of problem space and of stakeholder needs and expectations;<br
    />\r\nh) identify risks and opportunities associated with architectures; and<br
    />\r\ni) support decision making where architectures are involved.<br />\r\nNOTE
    This document addresses the evaluation of an architecture and not an evaluation
    of the architecture description's suitability. Matters concerning the evaluation
    of the architecture description fall within the scope of the architecture conceptualization
    and architecture elaboration processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020. However,
    it is sometimes the case that the architecture description is evaluated concurrently
    with the evaluation of the architecture itself.<br />\r\nThe entity being evaluated
    can be of several kinds, as illustrated in the following examples: enterprise,
    organization, solution, system, subsystem, business, data (as a data element or
    data structure), application, information technology (as a collection), mission,
    product, service, software item, hardware item, etc. The kind of entity can also
    be a product line, family of systems, system of systems, etc. It also spans the
    variety of applications that utilize digital technology such as mobile, cloud,
    big data, robotics, Internet of Things (IoT), web, desktop, embedded systems,
    and so on.<br />\r\nThe generic Architecture Evaluation (AE) framework specified
    in this document can be used in support of the Architecture Evaluation process
    defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 42020. Specific frameworks can be derived from this generic
    framework, which can provide a mapping to the system life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 or to the software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207."
