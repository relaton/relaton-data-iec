abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 defines the air interface for radio-frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating below 135 kHz used in item management applications. Its
    purpose is to provide a common technical specification for RFID devices to allow
    for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing
    RFID market in the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 defines the
    forward and return link parameters for technical attributes including, but not
    limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy, occupied channel
    bandwidth, spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate,
    bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order. It further defines the communications
    protocol used in the air interface.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 contains
    two types. The detailed technical differences between the types are shown in the
    parameter tables.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-2:2004 specifies<br />\r\nthe physical
    layer that is used for communication between the interrogator and the tag;<br
    />\r\nthe protocol and the commands;<br />\r\nthe method to detect and communicate
    with one tag among several tags (\"anti-collision\").<br /><br />\r\nIt specifies
    two types of tags: Type A (FDX) and Type B (HDX). These two types differ only
    by their physical layer. Both types support the same anti-collision and protocol.<br
    /><br />\r\nFDX tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, including during
    the tag-to-interrogator transmission. They operate at 125 kHz.<br /><br />\r\nHDX
    tags are powered by the interrogator, except during the tag-to-interrogator transmission.
    They operate at 134,2 kHz. An alternative operating frequency is described.<br
    /><br />\r\nAn optional anti-collision mechanism is also described."
