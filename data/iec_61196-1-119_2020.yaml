abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-1-119:2020 defines the requirements to determine the average
    power handling capability of a coaxial cable at specified frequencies at ambient
    temperatures. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published
    in 2012. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- title was changed from: RF power rating
    to: RF average power rating;<br />\r\n- a test method to determine sufficient
    duration is included as annex<br />\r\n- the equations used for calculating cable
    coefficients and RF average power rating are corrected;<br />\r\n- the clauses
    and subclauses are rearranged."
