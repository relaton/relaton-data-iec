abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24769-5:2012 defines the test methods for determining the conformance
    of real time locating systems (RTLS) tags and readers with the specifications
    given in the corresponding parts of ISO/IEC 24730-5.ISO/IEC 24769-5:2012 does
    not include the testing of conformity with regulatory requirements.The test methods
    require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are
    implemented, be verified.The conformance parameters described in ISO/IEC 24769-5:2012
    include the radio frequency air interface and packet exchange required to perform
    the locating of the RTLS tag. It includes the mandatory 2-ary orthogonal chirp
    spread spectrum (CSS) modulation and the optional differential quadrature phase
    shift keying (DQPSK) CSS. ISO/IEC 24769-5:2012 also includes the ranging packet
    exchanges, the commands and the reports defined in ISO/IEC 24730-5.Unless otherwise
    specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 24769-5:2012 shall be applied exclusively to RTLS
    tags and readers defined in ISO/IEC 24730-5.
