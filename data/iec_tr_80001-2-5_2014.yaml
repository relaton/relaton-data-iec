abstract:
- content: IEC TR 80001-2-5:2014(E) which is a technical report, gives guidance and
    practical techniques for responsible organizations, medical device manufacturers
    and providers of other information technology in the application of IEC 80001-1:2010
    for the risk management of distributed alarm systems. This technical report applies
    to the transmission of alarm conditions between sources, integrator and communicators
    where at least one source is a medical device and at least one communication path
    utilizes a medical IT-network. This technical report provides recommendations
    for the integration, communication of responses and redirection (to another operator)
    of alarm conditions from one or more sources to ensure safety and effectiveness.
    Data and systems security is an important consideration for the risk management
    of distributed alarm systems.
