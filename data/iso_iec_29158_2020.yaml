abstract:
- content: "This document is an engineering document intended for verifier manufacturers
    and application specification developers.<br />\r\nThis document describes modifications
    to the symbol quality methodology defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and a symbology specification.
    It defines alternative illumination conditions, some new terms and parameters,
    modifications to the measurement and subsequent grading of certain parameters
    and the reporting of the grading results.<br />\r\nThis document was developed
    to assess the symbol quality of direct marked parts, where the mark is applied
    directly to the surface of the item and the reading device is a two-dimensional
    imager.<br />\r\nWhen application specifications allow, this method is also potentially
    applicable to symbols produced by other methods. This is appropriate when direct
    part marked (DPM) symbols and non-DPM symbols are being scanned in the same scanning
    environment. The symbol grade is reported as a DPM grade rather than as an ISO/IEC
    15415 grade."
