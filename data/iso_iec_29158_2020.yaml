abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is an engineering document intended for verifier manufacturers
    and application specification developers.</p><p>This document describes modifications
    to the symbol quality methodology defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and a symbology specification.
    It defines alternative illumination conditions, some new terms and parameters,
    modifications to the measurement and subsequent grading of certain parameters
    and the reporting of the grading results.</p><p>This document was developed to
    assess the symbol quality of direct marked parts, where the mark is applied directly
    to the surface of the item and the reading device is a two-dimensional imager.</p><p>When
    application specifications allow, this method is also potentially applicable to
    symbols produced by other methods. This is appropriate when direct part marked
    (DPM) symbols and non-DPM symbols are being scanned in the same scanning environment.
    The symbol grade is reported as a DPM grade rather than as an ISO/IEC 15415 grade.</p>"
