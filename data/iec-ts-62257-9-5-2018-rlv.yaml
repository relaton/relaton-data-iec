  content: "IEC TS 62257-9-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TS
    62257-9-5:2018 applies to stand-alone renewable energy products. This document
    deals essentially with off-grid renewable energy products with batteries and solar
    modules with DC system voltages not exceeding 35 V and peak power ratings not
    exceeding 350 W. The tests contained herein are capable in many cases of adequately
    assessing systems at higher voltages and/or power ratings. This new edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- replaced the term \"stand-alone lighting kits\" with \"stand-alone renewable
    energy products\" throughout the document (including the title) to reflect that
    the revised document is applicable to a broader range of products with a more
    diverse set of capabilities.<br />\r\n- added test methods for flooded lead-acid
    batteries.<br />\r\n- significantly revised the protection tests, assessment of
    DC ports, appliance tests, and energy service calculations based on field experience.<br
    />\r\n- revised the voltage operating points at which testing is carried out to
    better reflect actual operation and to simplify the procedures for testing products
    without lights.<br />\r\n- revised the energy service calculations to include
    the effect of multiple simultaneously connected loads on the port voltage and
    battery-to-port efficiency and to accommodate products with grid or electromechanical
    charging."
