  content: "IEC 60332-3-23:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60332-3-23:2018
    covers category B for methods of test for the assessment of vertical flame spread
    of vertically-mounted bunched wires or cables, electrical or optical, under defined
    conditions.<br />\r\nThis document relates to cables installed on the test ladder
    to achieve a nominal total volume of non-metallic material of 3,5 l/m of test
    sample. The flame application time is 40 min. The method of mounting uses the
    front of the standard ladder. The category is intended for general use where medium
    volumes of non-metallic material are required to be evaluated. The test is intended
    for type approval testing. The requirements for the selection of cables for testing
    are given in Annex A. The flame spread is measured as the extent of damage of
    the cable sample. This procedure can be used to demonstrate the cable’s ability
    to limit flame spread. A recommended performance requirement is given in Annex
    B. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2000
    and Amendment 1:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) adjustments have been made to the title, and elsewhere, to
    emphasise the standard is applicable to optical fibre cables as well as metallic
    conductor types;<br />\r\nb) details of the way in which cables are mounted on
    the ladder have been better defined in order to improve repeatability and reproducibility.<br
    />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide
    104."
