abstract:
- content: "IEC 60512-9-5:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60512-9-5:2020
    when required by the detail product specification, is used for testing connectors
    or solderless connections within the scope of technical committee 48. It may also
    be used for similar devices when specified in a detail product specification.
    The object of this document is to detail a standard method for subjecting solderless
    connections to thermal stress conditioning by cyclic current loading. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- added method
    B and renamed the former test method as method A, to provide an alternative with
    more adjustable time “ON” and “OFF” for products with larger thermal mass.<br
    />\r\n- added introduction to provide background of this revision."
