  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO&#x2F;IEC 60559:2020(E) specifies
    formats and methods for floating-point arithmetic in computer systems - standard
    and extended functions with single, double, extended, and extendable precision
    - and recommends formats for data interchange. Exception conditions are defined
    and standard handling of these conditions is specified. It provides a method for
    computation with floating-point numbers that will yield the same result whether
    the processing is done in hardware, software, or a combination of the two. The
    results of the computation will be identical, independent of implementation, given
    the same input data. Errors, and error conditions, in the mathematical processing
    will be reported in a consistent manner regardless of implementation. This second
    edition, published as ISO&#x2F;IEC 60559, replaces the first edition ISO&#x2F;IEC&#x2F;IEEE
    60559:2011.
