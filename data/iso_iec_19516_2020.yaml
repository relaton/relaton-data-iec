abstract:
- content: "This International Standard specifies the OMG Interface Definition Language
    (IDL). IDL is a descriptive language used to define data types and interfaces
    in a way that is independent of the programming language or operating system/processor
    platform.<br />\r\nThe IDL specifies only the syntax used to define the data types
    and interfaces. It is normally used in connection with other standards that further
    define how these types/interfaces are utilized in specific contexts and platforms:<br
    />\r\n- Separate \"language mapping\" standards define how the IDL-defined constructs
    map to specific programming languages, such as, C/C++, Java, C#, etc.<br />\r\n-
    Separate \"serialization\" standards define how data objects and method invocations
    are serialized into a format suitable for network transmission.<br />\r\n- Separate
    \"middleware\" standards, such as, DDS or CORBA leverage the IDL to define data-types,
    services, and interfaces.<br />\r\nThe description of IDL grammar uses a syntax
    notation that is similar to Extended Backus-Naur Format (EBNF)."
