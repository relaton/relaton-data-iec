  content: IEC/TS 60318-7:2011(E) describes a head and torso simulator (manikin) intended
    for the measurement of air-conduction hearing aids in the frequency range from
    100 Hz to 10 000 Hz. The device consists of a head mounted on a torso that extends
    to the waist. The head is equipped with simulated pinnae and with cylindrical
    cavities having acoustic impedance terminations and microphones located at positions
    corresponding to those of the eardrums in a median human adult. It has been designed
    to provide acoustic diffraction similar to that encountered around the median
    human head and torso. The device with its present pinna simulator, however, is
    not suitable for the measurement of all types of hearing aids. For example, most
    in-the-ear (ITE) and completely-in-the-canal (CIC) hearing aids cannot be measured
    correctly. The manikin is specified in terms of both, its geometrical dimensions
    and its acoustical properties. IEC/TS 60318-7:2011 has been developed as a revision
    of IEC/TR 60959 (1990). The main changes, as compared to the technical report,
    are the insertion of maximum permitted expanded measurement uncertainties and
    additional references in the Bibliography. A future IEC Standard which will include
    additional models of head and torso simulators for hearing aid measurements is
    planned.
