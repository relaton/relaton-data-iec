    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-29-2:2015 gives
    guidance on, and recommended practice for, the selection, installation, safe use
    and maintenance of electrically operated Group II equipment intended for use in
    industrial and commercial safety applications and Group I equipment in underground
    coal mines for the detection and measurement of flammable gases complying with
    the requirements of IEC 60079-29-1 or IEC 60079-29-4. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical
