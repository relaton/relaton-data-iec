abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be  downloaded
    \ from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis International Standard specifies the Wireless Terminal Location Registration
    supplementary service (SS-WTLR) and the Wireless Terminal Information Exchange
    additional network feature (ANF-WTINFO), which are applicable to various basic
    services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services
    are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nThe Wireless Terminal Location Registration
    Supplementary Service (SS-WTLR) enables a WTM user to register at, or de-register
    from, the current location within the PISN. The ability to register at different
    locations in the PISN at different times enables the WTM user to maintain the
    provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls) at different
    access points. De-registration is used to inform the PISN that the WTM user is
    temporarily unable to make use of the provided services (including the receipt
    of incoming calls).<br />\r\nThe Information Exchange Additional Network Feature
    (ANF-WTINFO) allows to exchange information about a WTLR user between the Home
    Data Base and the Visitor Data Base.<br />\r\nSupplementary service and additional
    network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the
    method described in CCITT Recommendation I.130. This International Standard contains
    the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-WTLR and ANF-WTINFO. The stage 1
    specification (clause 6 and 7) specifies the service/feature as seen by users
    of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 8 and 9) identifies the functional
    entities involved in the service/feature and the information flows between them."
