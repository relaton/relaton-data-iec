  content: Within customer premises, the importance of the cabling infrastructure
    is similar to that of other fundamental building utilities such as heating, lighting
    and mains power. Historically, the cabling within premises comprised both application
    specific and multipurpose networks. The original edition of this standard enabled
    a controlled migration to generic cabling and the reduction in the use of application-specific
    cabling. Edition 2.0 of ISO/IEC 11801 has been developed to reflect the increased
    demands and opportunities which have arisen since -- and are partly the result
    of -- publication of the first edition in 1995. The current edition 2.1 incorporates
    Amendment 1, which provides requirements for new Class E(A) and F(A) channels
    plus additions and corrections to ISO/IEC 11801:2002. This consolidated version
    consists of the second edition (2002) and its amendment 1 (2008). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.
