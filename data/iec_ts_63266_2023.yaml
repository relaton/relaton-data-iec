abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63266:2023 specifies a structure for representation of exchanged
    information that is essential for testing and maintenance of the devices in power
    utility automation systems. It is mainly intended to be applied to communication
    equipment that communicate information in accordance with IEC 61850 (all parts)
    in at least one part of their communication flow.<br />\r\nThe following communication
    equipment is included within the scope:<br />\r\n– optical instrument transformer;<br
    />\r\n– conventional instrument transformers related to IEC 61850 traffic;<br
    />\r\n– merging unit;<br />\r\n– stand-alone merging unit;<br />\r\n– protection,
    control and measuring devices with at least one IEC 61850 interface;<br />\r\n–
    switchgear control unit (breaker IED);<br />\r\n– switchgear providing IEC 61850
    interface;<br />\r\n– IEC 61850 time synchronization device;<br />\r\n– IEC 61850
    gateway (RTU) and station HMI;<br />\r\n– digital disturbance recorder / digital
    fault recorder;<br />\r\n– digital communication protocol gateways with at least
    one IEC 61850 interface;<br />\r\n– protection, control and measuring devices
    that utilise a proprietary protocol for communication with devices that have at
    least one IEC 61850 interface.<br />\r\nThe following communication equipment,
    scheme and protocols are excluded from the scope:<br />\r\n– IEC 61850 Ethernet
    switches and network topology;<br />\r\n– PMU phasor measurement unit with at
    least one IEC 61850 interface;<br />\r\n– the full path of substation-to-substation
    communication;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 1: The description of R­GOOSE Publisher in substation
    A does not include the description of R GOOSE Subscriber in substation B.<br />\r\n–
    functions with only hardwired communication, e.g. direct analogue copper wired
    connection;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 2: A current transformer connected to a protection
    relay with hardwired tripping of a circuit breaker.<br />\r\n– functions using
    only proprietary communication protocol systems;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 3: A dedicated
    system for collecting disturbance recorder files with courier protocol or path
    from IEC 60870­5­103 to IEC 60870-5-101 will not be presented in this document.<br
    />\r\n– protocol mappings to XMPP (IEC 61850-8-2).<br />\r\nThis document forms
    a supplement to other documentation standards in power utility automation.<br
    />\r\nIt also harmonizes the representation of the logical data flow structures
    based on IEC 61850 communication among different devices in order to provide a
    reference document that can be created for any IEC 61850 substation.<br />\r\nThis
    document focuses in principle on the visualization of the digital information
    exchanged between IEDs and control or measurement devices in a power utility automation
    system. The information visualization does not refer to any graphical modelling
    but to a tabular format of presentation. The data in tabular format can be used
    as a basis for other kinds of visual presentation outside the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nFor representing all kinds of substation information, a single suitable
    tabular form is not possible to find. This document instead presents a limited
    number of high visual performance representation formats.<br />\r\nPresentation
    formats described in this document provide interactive visualization that assists
    users in analysing data and identifying some important and essential information
    in a more efficient way."
