abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the capabilities of a tool to support review
    work.</p><p>The evaluation and selection of the review tools are performed in
    accordance with ISO/IEC 20741 which defines the general evaluation selection process
    and evaluation characteristics. This document defines capabilities specific to
    review tools in the process. By using these two standards together, it is possible
    to derive objective and reasonable results of the evaluation and selection of
    review tools.</p><p>The review work is based on the process, activities, and tasks
    defined in ISO/IEC 20246. It is also assumed that the review targets are defined
    in ISO/IEC 20246. The review work in this document is assumed not to be performed
    by a 3rd party, but within a project.</p><p>The review tool capabilities specified
    in this document harmonize with the review process defined in ISO/IEC 20246. This
    document does not include automated process, activities, or tasks for conducting
    reviews such as automated source code checkers defined in ISO/IEC 30130.</p><p>Issues
    which are identified in the review are recorded and managed by the tool; but defects
    found in tests and issues found in general except for reviews are out of the scope
    of this document.</p>"
