abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23004-4:2007 specifies the interfaces of the support application
    programming interface and the realization technology used for resource management
    in MPEG Multimedia Middleware (M3W). Resource management is an optional framework
    for M3W platforms. ISO/IEC 23004-4:2007 specifies entities and interfaces for
    resource budget creation, assignment and removal, entity and interfaces for assessing
    the feasibility and selecting resource configurations (resource configuration
    = set of assigned budgets), interfaces implemented by quality-aware entities (Quality-aware
    entities can provide multiple quality levels and know the resource needed to provide
    each quality level.), entity and interfaces for coordination of the "budget--quality
    level" negotiation (includes interfaces for registration and setting priorities).
