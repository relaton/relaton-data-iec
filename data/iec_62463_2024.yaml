abstract:
- content: "IEC 62463:2024 is applicable to security screening systems designed to
    expose persons to Xâ€‘rays. In particular, the document applies to systems where
    the body is exposed to the primary beam of X-rays. It is common to divide currently
    used systems into three types: backscatter systems, transmission systems and combination
    backscatter/transmission systems. The purpose of this document is to provide standardized
    requirements and test methods to ensure the safe operation of X-ray personnel
    screening systems, from a radiation protection point of view. In particular, the
    document specifies requirements related to the radiation protection of the persons
    being screened, persons who are in the vicinity of the equipment and the operators.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2010. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) title modified;<br />\r\nb) the main dose
    quantity was updated from ambient dose equivalent (H*(10)) to the operational
    quantities recommended in ICRU Report 95:2020;<br />\r\nc) the scope has been
    updated from X-ray systems for screening persons to X-ray systems that deliberately
    expose persons to X-rays for security purposes, which clarifies the ambiguity
    of whether d) occupied vehicle scanners are within scope;<br />\r\nd) the scheme
    for classifying systems was changed from one based on whether the system is backscatter,
    transmission or a combination to a classification system based on the dose level
    and administrative controls;<br />\r\ne) numerous electrical, environmental, electromagnetic,
    and mechanical safety requirements were updated."
