abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-27-2:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of paper
    tape covered round aluminium winding wires. This covering consists of two or more
    layers of paper tape and is primarily intended for winding coils for oil immersed
    transformers. The range of nominal conductor diameters covered by this document
    is:<br />\r\n- 0,500 mm up to and including 5,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe nominal conductor
    diameters are specified in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-3:2008 and IEC 60317-0-3:2008/AMD1:2013.
    The paper tapes included in this document are restricted to those covered in IEC
    60554-1 and IEC 60554-3-5."
