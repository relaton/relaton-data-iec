  content: This part of IEC 61282 provides definitions of dispersion penalty and other
    related penalties. It describes the direct measurement of these penalties using
    a BER test set and the calculation of the penalties from time-resolved chirp (TRC)
    data. Annex A provides the theory for power penalty calculations.
