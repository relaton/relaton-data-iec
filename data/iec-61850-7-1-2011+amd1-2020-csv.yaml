  content: "IEC 61850-7-1:2011+A1:2020 introduces the modelling methods, communication
    principles, and information models that are used in the various parts of the IEC
    61850-7 series. The purpose is to provide - from a conceptual point of view -
    assistance to understand the basic modelling concepts and description methods
    for:<br />\r\n- substation-specific information models for power utility automation
    systems,<br />\r\n- device functions used for power utility automation purposes,
    and<br />\r\n- communication systems to provide interoperability within power
    utility facilities. Compared to the first edition, this second edition introduces:<br
    />\r\n- the model for statistical and historical statistical data,<br />\r\n-
    the concepts of proxies, gateways, LD hierarchy and LN inputs,<br />\r\n- the
    model for time synchronisation,<br />\r\n- the concepts behind different testing
    facilities,<br />\r\n- the extended logging function. It also clarifies certain
    items.<br />\r\n<strong>This consolidated version consists of the second edition
    (2011) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong>"
