  content: "To enable and realize the true value of the internet of things (IoT),
    edge intelligence pushes processing for data intensive applications away from
    the core of the cloud to the edge of the network.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis radical
    transformation from the cloud to the edge, edge intelligence, will support trillions
    of sensors and billions of systems. It will treat data in motion differently from
    data at rest.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper synthesizes current trends in
    the areas of cloud computing, mobile networking, IoT and other domains that require
    low delay in communication and decision. Such domains include smart manufacturing,
    video analysis for security and safety, automotive, intelligent city furniture
    or virtual reality. The publication explores market potential and vertical use
    case requirements, analyzes gaps and produces recommendations for adopting vertical
    edge intelligence technologies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper was developed
    by the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>) edge
    intelligence project team with major contributions from Huawei and the Fraunhofer
    Institute for Open Communications Systems FOKUS.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White
    Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/edge-intelligence\">free
