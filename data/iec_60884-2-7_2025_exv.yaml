abstract:
- content: "IEC 60884-2-7:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60884-2-7:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60884-1:2022.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60884-2-7:2025 applies to cord extension
    sets, rewirable and non-rewirable, with or without earthing contact, with a rated
    voltage greater than 50 V but not exceeding 440 V and a rated current not exceeding
    16 A, intended for household and similar purposes, either indoors or outdoors.
    This document does not apply to cord extension sets with means for reeling. Cord
    extension sets intended to be used as socket-outlets for furniture are additionally
    covered by IEC 60884‑2‑8. This document also applies to cord extension sets which
    are intended to be used in a cable reel, and which therefore become cable reels
    with a detachable flexible cable. For the combination of the cord extension set,
    the reel requirements and tests of IEC 61242 apply in addition.<br />\r\nCord
    extension sets are suitable for use at ambient temperatures not normally exceeding
    +40 °C, but their average temperature over a period of 24 h does not exceed +35
    °C, with a lower limit of the ambient air temperature of −5 °C.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2011, and Amendment
    1:2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
