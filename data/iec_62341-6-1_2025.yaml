abstract:
- content: "<p>IEC 62341-6-1:2025 specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measuring methods for determining the optical and electro-optical parameters of
    organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays. Except for the power consumption
    method, all methods are intended for unbounded input signals measured in the flat
    regions of the display in a dark room. This fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2022. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The standard average picture level (APL) RGBCMY
    test pattern is modified, and the variable signal loading RGBCMY test pattern
    is added.<br />\r\n- Chromaticity gamut area and colour gamut volume are modified.</p>"
