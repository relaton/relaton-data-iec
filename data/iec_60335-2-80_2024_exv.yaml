abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-80:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-80:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-80:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric fans for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nExamples of the types of fans that this standard is applicable to are<br
    />\r\n- ceiling fans;<br />\r\n- duct fans;<br />\r\n- infant fans;<br />\r\n-
    partition fans;<br />\r\n- pedestal fans;<br />\r\n- table fans.<br />\r\nThis
    standard also applies to separate controls supplied with fans.<br />\r\nInfant
    fans are also tested to the applicable requirements of the ISO 8124 series, since
    it covers hazards other than those arising from the use of electricity such as
    toxicological hazards.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use
    but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended for use in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope
    of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- fans incorporated in other appliances.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) introduction
    of requirements for infant fans (7.12, 7.12.1, 8.1.1, 11.8, 20.2, 21.103, 22.44,
    22.54, 22.102, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) introduction of the use of test probe
    19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\ne) introduction of surface temperature
    limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nf) clarification of testing of fans for use in a
    tropical climate (5.7, Annex P 11.8);<br />\r\ng) clarification of requirements
    for remote operation of fans (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to
    be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
