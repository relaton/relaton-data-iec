    deals with the safety of auto-transformers for general applications and power
    supply units incorporating auto-transformers for general applications. Transformers
    incorporating electronic circuits are also covered by this document. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- adjustment
