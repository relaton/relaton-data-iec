abstract:
- content: IEC 62783-1-1:2022 specifies time domain test methods, parameters and requirements
    for fixtures for twinax cables (known also as twin-axial cables or twin-coaxial
    cables) used in digital communication systems. The methods and fixtures facilitate
    measurements of differential and common mode transmission parameters as well as
    single-ended mode parameters. This document is applicable to twinax cables and
    also to symmetric cables with pitch.
