abstract:
- content: "The term bio-digital convergence denotes the convergence of engineering,
    nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science. While
    the concept is at least 20 years old, developments in the area have been turbocharged
    by the fast-paced changes and evolution of information and digital technologies.<br
    /><br />\r\nSuch multi-disciplinary solutions are key to tackling global environmental,
    governmental and societal challenges. Breakthroughs in biomedical devices, artificial
    organs and stem cell research have been vital to modern healthcare solutions.
    Agricultural bioengineering or genetic engineering of food helps address global
    challenges around hunger and economic welfare. Strides in environmental monitoring
    are crucial to managing clean air, water or soil. With a rapidly evolving technology
    landscape, it becomes imperative for standards around the area to co-evolve to
    ensure efficient progress.<br /><br />\r\nThe IEC Standardization Evaluation Group
    (SEG) 12 on Bio-digital convergence (BDC) has been systematically assessing different
    aspects of BDC: reverse engineering of living systems, human augmentation technologies,
    life systems and bioengineering, agricultural bioengineering, environmental bioengineering,
    and bio-digital social, risk and ethical aspects.<br /><br />\r\nThe technology
    report elaborates on the scope of the working groups focussed on these individual
    domains, and sheds light upon some of their key findings. The report takes a comprehensive
    look at the current standardization landscape across these areas and identifies
    pertinent standardization opportunities. It also discusses various market trends
    in emerging application areas such as neuroscience, biosensors, drug discovery,
    artificial organs or even human augmentation like brain-machine interfaces.<br
    /><br />\r\nThe report ends with a list of recommendations of the working groups
    to the IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) as well as the results of the
    Boardâ€™s decisions concerning their adoption.<br /><br />\r\nThis Technology Report
    is available for free download."
