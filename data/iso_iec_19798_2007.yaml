abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19798:2007 defines a method for testing and calculation of average
    yield measured in the number of standard pages for a colour toner cartridge and
    specific printer printing in a semi-continuous mode under a defined set of conditions.
    It uses the test page suite defined in ISO/IEC 24712. ISO/IEC 19798:2007 can also
    be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital
    input-printing path (i.e. multi-function devices that contain printer components).
    ISO/IEC 19798:2007 is only intended for the measurement of colour toner cartridge
    yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability,
    etc.
