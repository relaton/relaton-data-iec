  content: "IEC 60068-2-83:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60068-2-83:2025
    provides methods for comparative investigation of the wettability of the metallic
    terminations or metallized terminations of SMDs with solder paste. Data obtained
    by these methods are not intended to be used as absolute quantitative data for
    pass/fail purposes.<br />\r\nNOTE Different solderability test methods for SMD
    are described in IEC 60068‑2‑58 and IEC 60068‑2‑69. IEC 60068‑2‑58 specifies visual
    evaluation using solder bath and reflow method, IEC 60068‑2‑69 specifies wetting
    balance evaluation using solder bath and solder globule method.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical change with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) revise Clause 5 to align with that in IEC 60068‑2‑20:2021."
