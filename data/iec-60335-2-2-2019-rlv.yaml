  content: "IEC 60335-2-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-2:2019
    deals with the safety of electric vacuum cleaners and water suction cleaning appliances
    for household and similar purposes, including vacuum cleaners for animal grooming,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V. It also applies to centrally-sited
    vacuum cleaners and automatic battery-operated cleaners.<br />\r\nThis standard
    also applies to motorized cleaning heads and current-carrying hoses associated
    with a particular vacuum cleaner.<br />\r\nBattery-operated appliances and other
    DC supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard. Dual supply appliances,
    either mains-supplied or battery-operated, are regarded as battery-operated appliances
    when operated in the battery mode.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal
    household use, but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops and other premises for
    normal housekeeping purposes, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nExamples
    of such appliances are appliances intended to be used for normal housekeeping
    purposes in hotels, offices, schools, hospitals and similar premises.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national
    water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– wet and dry vacuum cleaners, including power brush, for commercial use
    (IEC 60335-2-69).<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth
    edition published in 2009, Amendment 1:2012 and Amendment 2:2016. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n–
    some requirements for appliances for animal grooming have been modified (6.1,
    25.7)<br />\r\n– the note in 7.101 has been deleted;<br />\r\n– converted some
    notes to normative text (7.102, 10.1, 11.3, 13.1, 15.2, 15.101, 19.101, 20.1,
    20.2, 21.103, 21.105, 22.32, 25.23);<br />\r\n– clarification that the test of
    19.7 is applicable to vacuum cleaners with a motorized brush or similar device;<br
    />\r\n– modified Annex R for alignment with 22.201 of Annex B;<br />\r\n– modified
    Annex S in accordance with IEC 60335-2-2:2009/ISH1:2016.<br />\r\nThis Part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments.
    It was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
