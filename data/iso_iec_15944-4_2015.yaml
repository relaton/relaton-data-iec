abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15944-4:2015 provides a set of UML class diagrams and conceptual
    explanations that circumscribe the Open-edi Business Transaction Ontology (OeBTO).
    It explains the mechanics of a business transaction state machine, the procedural
    component of an OeBTO, and the (internal) constraint component of OeBTO, its repository
    for business rules.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15944-4:2015 addresses collaborations among
    independent trading partners as defined in ISO/IEC 15944‑1. ISO/IEC 15944-4:2015
    applies to both binary collaborations (buyer and seller) and mediated collaborations
    (buyer, seller, third-party). The ontological features described herein propose
    standards only for the Business Operational View (BOV), that is, the business
    aspects of business transactions as they are defined in ISO/IEC 15944‑1.</p>"
