abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-4:2015 provides a set of UML class diagrams and conceptual explanations
    that circumscribe the Open-edi Business Transaction Ontology (OeBTO). It explains
    the mechanics of a business transaction state machine, the procedural component
    of an OeBTO, and the (internal) constraint component of OeBTO, its repository
    for business rules. ISO/IEC 15944-4:2015 addresses collaborations among independent
    trading partners as defined in ISO/IEC 15944-1. ISO/IEC 15944-4:2015 applies to
    both binary collaborations (buyer and seller) and mediated collaborations (buyer,
    seller, third-party). The ontological features described herein propose standards
    only for the Business Operational View (BOV), that is, the business aspects of
    business transactions as they are defined in ISO/IEC 15944-1."
