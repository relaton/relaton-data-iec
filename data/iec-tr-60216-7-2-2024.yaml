  script: Latn
  content: "IEC TR 60216-7-2:2024 is intended to validate the procedures of IEC TS
    60216-­7-­1 in providing a similar temperature index to conventional methods used
    in other parts of the IEC 60216 series. The round robin test results do not provide
    statistical analysis for precision. The round robin test focuses on preliminary
    studies to understand the evaluation and calculation procedures, influence on
    apparatus, and data variance among laboratories before determination of precision.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Annex A (informative) has been added to provide a round robin test with
    a different polymer type - polybuthylene terephthalate (PBY) - as an additional
    use case of the method in accordance with IEC TS 60216-7-1;<br />\r\nb) Tables
    3 to 11 have been corrected by adding units, and texts have been refined for more
    technical clarifications of the procedures and observations."
