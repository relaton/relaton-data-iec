  content: "<!-- NEW -->CISPR TR 18-3:2017 which is a technical report, applies to
    radio noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment which may cause
    interference to radio reception, excluding the fields from power line carrier
    signals. The frequency range covered is 0,15 MHz to 3 GHz. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- localisation system of
    spark discharges which might contain frequency components up to 3 GHz;<br />\r\n-
    information regarding equations for predetermination of the radio noise level
    from HVDC overhead power lines.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: radio noise from
    overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment"
