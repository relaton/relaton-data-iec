abstract:
- content: "<p>This document:</p><ul><li>provides an expanded view of the processes
    from ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 that implement systems engineering (SE) management for
    the life cycles of technical solutions;</li><li>describes a required information
    item, termed the systems engineering management plan (SEMP) for the technical
    management and execution of the SE of technical solutions,</li><li>provides requirements
    and guidance for the content of the required information item.</li></ul><p>This
    document is applicable to:</p><ul><li>those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 on projects dealing with human-made systems, products and services;</li><li>those
    who are responsible for the technical management of projects concerned with the
    engineering of systems;</li><li>those responsible for planning or executing ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 system life cycle processes at a project level;</li><li>organizations and
    individuals involved with a technical project management effort;</li><li>anyone
    developing engineering management documentation to complete technical planning
    aspects of their project’s processes.</li></ul><p>This document is intended to
    provide guidance for two-party situations and can be equally applied where the
    two parties are from the same organization. This document can also be used by
    a single party as self-imposed tasks.</p><p>This document can also serve as guidance
    in multi-party situations, where high risks are inherent in the supply and integration
    of complex systems, and procurement can involve several suppliers, organizations
    or parties.</p>"
