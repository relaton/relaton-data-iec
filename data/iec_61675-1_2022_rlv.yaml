abstract:
- content: "IEC 61675-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61675-1:2022
    specifies terminology and test methods for declaring the characteristics of POSITRON
    EMISSION TOMOGRAPHS. POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHS detect the ANNIHILATION RADIATION
    of positron emitting RADIONUCLIDES by COINCIDENCE DETECTION. IEC 61675-1:2022
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    change with respect to the previous edition: requirements have been changed or
    newly created regarding the technical aspects of SPATIAL RESOLUTION, sensitivity
    measurement, SCATTER FRACTION, COUNT RATE performance, image quality, PET/CT registration
    accuracy and time-of-flight resolution."
