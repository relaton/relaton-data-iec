abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-5:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristics\r\n\r\n\tcontact resistance, and\r\n\tsheet resistance\r\n\r\nfor
    graphene-based materials and other two-dimensional materials by a\r\n\r\n\r\n\ttransmission
    line measurement.\r\n\r\nThe method uses test structures applied to the 2D material
    by photolithographic methods consisting of several metal electrodes with increasing
    spacing between the electrodes. By a measurement of the voltage drop between different
    pairs of electrodes, sheet resistance and contact resistance can be calculated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
    method can be applied to any other two-dimensional materials which are subject
    to electrical metal contact on top of the materials.\r\n\tThe method provides
    accurate and reproducible results, if the electrical contact formed between the
    two-dimensional material and the metal electrodes provides ohmic contact property."
