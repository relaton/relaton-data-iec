abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-5:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristics<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">contact resistance,
    and</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">sheet resistance</li></ul>\r\nfor graphene-based
    materials and other two-dimensional materials by a<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">transmission
    line measurement.</li></ul>\r\nThe method uses test structures applied to the
    2D material by photolithographic methods consisting of several metal electrodes
    with increasing spacing between the electrodes. By a measurement of the voltage
    drop between different pairs of electrodes, sheet resistance and contact resistance
    can be calculated.<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">The method can be applied
    to any other two-dimensional materials which are subject to electrical metal contact
    on top of the materials.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">The method provides
    accurate and reproducible results, if the electrical contact formed between the
    two-dimensional material and the metal electrodes provides ohmic contact property.</li></ul>"
