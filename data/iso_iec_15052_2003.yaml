abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15052:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of Recall supplementary
    service (SS-RE) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN).<br />\r\nSS-RE is a supplementary service which provides for the re-direction
    of a transferred call back to the served user if the call is unanswered. SS-RE
    is only applicable after transfer by join, not after transfer by rerouteing.<br
    />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300
    387. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q
    reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage
    2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15051.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-RE
    operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control,
    as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures
    for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15052:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the
    support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-RE and other supplementary
    services and ANFs. However, the interaction with the Call Transfer supplementary
    service is specified as part of SS-RE signalling procedures as it is the essential
    aspect of the Recall supplementary service.<br />\r\nNOTE Additional interactions
    that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be
    found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15052:2003 is applicable
    to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN."
