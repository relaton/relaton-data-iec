abstract:
- content: 'Specifies the procedure to be followed by a registration authority in
    preparing, maintaining und publishing an international register of numeric identifiers
    allocated to the algorithms, excluding cryptographic ones. Describes in detail:
    registration authority; sponsoring authorities; registration, withdrawal, correction
    and revision procedure; early reservation of an identifier. An identifier registered
    in accordance with this standard serves as an identification of the algorithm
    associated with it in the register. Apart from such identification, registration
    does not affect the status of the algorithm concerned.'
