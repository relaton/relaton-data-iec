abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19794-14:2022 This document specifies a data interchange format
    for the exchange of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) data for person identification
    or verification technologies that utilize human DNA. Consideration of laboratory
    procedures is out of scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides the
    ability for DNA profile data to be exchanged and used for comparison (subject
    to privacy regulations) with DNA profile data produced by any other system that
    is based on a compatible DNA profiling technique and where the data format conforms
    to this document.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to cover current forensic
    DNA profiling or typing techniques that are based on short tandem repeats (STRs),
    including STRs on the X chromosome (X-STRs) the Y chromosome (Y-STRs), as well
    as mitochondrial DNA. A single DNA profile for a subject can contain data resulting
    from more than one of these different DNA techniques. This document enables data
    from multiple DNA techniques to be presented in a single DNA profile for a given
    subject.<br />\r\nThis document has been prepared in light of ongoing efforts
    to reduce human involvement in the processing (enrolment and comparison) of DNA.
    In anticipation of the data format requirements for automated DNA techniques,
    this document describes a format for both processed and raw (electrophoretic)
    DNA data. A normative XML schema definition (XSD) is provided in Clause A.1 for
    the syntax of DNA data XML documents. In Clause A.2, there is a sample DNA data
    XML document.<br />\r\nThis document is not intended for any other purposes than
    exchange of DNA for biometric verification and identification of individuals.
    In particular, it is not intended for the exchange of medical and other health-related
    information.<br />\r\nThis document also specifies elements of conformance testing
    methodology, test assertions and test procedures as applicable to this document.
    It establishes test assertions pertaining to the structure of the DNA data format
    (Type A Level 1 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1:2011/Amd. 1:2013) and test assertions
    pertaining to internal consistency of the values contained within each field (Type
    A,ind Level 2 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1:2011/Amd. 1:2013). This document also
    specifies test assertions pertaining to the content of DNA data XML documents
    (Level 3 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1:2011/Amd. 1:2013). The successful completion
    of Level 1 and Level 2 is a prerequisite for carrying out the tests at Level 3.<br
    />\r\nThe conformance testing methodology specified in this document does not
    establish:<br />\r\n- tests of other characteristics of biometric products or
    other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance, robustness,
    security);<br />\r\n- tests of systems not claimed to conform to the requirements
    of this document."
