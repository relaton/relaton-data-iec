  content: "IEC 62037-8:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62037-8:2025
    defines a radiated passive intermodulation (PIM) test to determine PIM levels
    generated by a device or object when it is exposed to RF radiation. This test
    can be conducted on any material or object and is not limited to devices designed
    to propagate RF signals. This test can be conducted as either a near field or
    far field test as defined by the test specification in an outdoor test site or
    in an anechoic test chamber.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added safety warning to verify that transmitters
    are switched off before connecting or disconnecting any component;<br />\r\nb)
    corrected formula for calculating directivity;<br />\r\nc) corrected antenna orientation
    labels in Figure 6;<br />\r\nd) added clarification that PIM tests reports shall
    include maximum PIM and VSWR values."
