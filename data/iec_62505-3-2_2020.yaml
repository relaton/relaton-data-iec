abstract:
- content: "IEC 62505-3-2:2020 is applicable to new current transformers which are:<br
    />\r\n- intended for use in indoor or outdoor fixed installations in traction
    systems, and<br />\r\n- operated with an AC line voltage and frequency as specified
    in IEC 60850.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2009.This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- this standard was revised to
    reflect the latest versions of standards referenced and to remove text already
    included in the IEC 61869 series.<br />\r\n- the structure of the document was
    adapted to that of IEC 62505‑1 and IEC 62505‑2.<br />\r\n- ratings have been added
    to provide designations in line with other railway standards, for example IEC
    62497.<br />\r\n- test requirements have been detailed to meet operating conditions
    of railway applications.<br />\r\n- partial discharge voltages have been specified."
