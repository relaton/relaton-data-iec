  content: CISPR TR 16-4-5:2006+A1:2014+A2:2021 specifies a method to enable product
    committees to develop limits for alternative test methods, using conversions from
    established limits. This method is generally applicable for all kinds of disturbance
    measurements, but focuses on radiated disturbance measurements (i.e. field strength),
    for which several alternative methods are presently specified. These limits development
    methods are intended for use by product committees and other groups responsible
    for defining emissions limits in situations where it is decided to use alternative
    test methods and the associated limits in product standards.
