abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-109:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62271-109:2019 is applicable
    to AC series capacitor by-pass switches designed for outdoor installation and
    for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on systems having voltages above
    52 kV. It is only applicable to by-pass switches for use in three-phase systems.
    This document is also applicable to the operating devices of by-pass switches
    and to their auxiliary equipment. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2008 and Amendment 1:2013. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition contains the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the document has been
    restructured according to edition 2.0 of IEC 62271-1;<br />\r\nb) the rated voltage
    assignation across the by-pass switch has been aligned to the rule defined in
    IEC 60143-1;<br />\r\nc) clarification has been given regarding rated continuous
    current of compensated and uncompensated line;<br />\r\nd) some clarifications
    have been given following a loss of \"suitable precautions\";<br />\r\ne) as per
    Amendment 2 of IEC 62271-100, the section \"Rated time quantities\" has been moved
    to Clause 6 under \"Time quantities\";<br />\r\nf) as per Amendment 2 of IEC 62271-100,
    the section \"Test for static mechanical loads\" have been moved to Clause 6 under
    \"Static mechanical loads\";<br />\r\ng) additional rules have been introduced
    for vacuum interrupters during impulse tests;<br />\r\nh) additional clarifications
    have been given regarding the number of reduced impulses during impulse tests;<br
    />\r\ni) a wider tolerance on the current damping during by-pass making current
    test-duty has been introduced.</p>"
