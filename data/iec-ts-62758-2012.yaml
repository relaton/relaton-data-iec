  content: IEC/TS 62758:2012(E) presents a standard method to estimate the performance
    of a pulsed electro-acoustic (PEA) measurement system. For this purpose, a systematic
    procedure is recommended for the calibration of the measurement system. Using
    the procedure, users can estimate whether the system works properly or not.
