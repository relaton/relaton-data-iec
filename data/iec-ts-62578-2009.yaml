    IEC/TS 62578:2009(E) describes the operation conditions and typical characteristics of Active Infeed Converters (AIC) of all technologies and topologies which can be connected between the electrical power supply system (lines) and a current or voltage stiff d.c.-side and which can convert electrical power (active and reactive) in both directions (generative or regenerative). The following is excluded from the scope:<br />
    - requirements for the design, development or further functionality of active infeed applications;<br />
    - probability of interactions or influences of the AIC with other equipment caused by parasitic elements in an installation as well as their mitigation.
