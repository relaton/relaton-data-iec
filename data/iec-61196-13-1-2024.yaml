  content: "IEC 61196-13-1:2024 applies to coaxial communication cables described
    in IEC 61196-13. It specifies the requirements of semi-rigid coaxial communication
    cables with silicon dioxide dielectric and tubular outer conductor. These cables
    are intended for use in applications demanding the extreme environments as well
    as the nuclear power plant, oil rig and aircraft engine.<br />\r\nThis document
    determines the layout and style for detail specifications. Detail specifications
    (DS) can be prepared by a national organization, a manufacturer or a user by entering
    the details in the blank detail specification."
