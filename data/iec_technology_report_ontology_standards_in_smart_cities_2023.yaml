abstract:
- content: "Ontology is crucial for IoT, big data, AI, and smart city systems. It
    enhances interoperability, traceability, and intelligent decision-making. Ontology
    also plays a crucial role in the development of standards that are considered
    as SMART. However, a common understanding and approach to ontology are lacking
    among different standards organizations.<br /><br />\r\nThis report is an output
    of the international virtual seminar Standards Collaboration on Ontologies for
    Smart Cities and Smart City Systems, jointly hosted by the IEC Academy, IEC SyC
    Smart Cities and ISO/IEC JTC 1 from 22-23 September 2022.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    Technology Report is available for free download."
