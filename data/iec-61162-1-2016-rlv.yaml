  content: "IEC 61162-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61162-1:2016(E) contains
    the requirements for data communication between maritime electronic instruments,
    navigation and radiocommunication equipment when interconnected via an appropriate
    system. This part of IEC 61162 is intended to support one-way serial data transmission
    from a single talker to one or more listeners. These data are in printable ASCII
    form and may include information such as position, speed, depth, frequency allocation,
    etc. Typical messages may be from about 11 to a maximum of 79 characters in length
    and generally require transmission no more rapidly than one message per second.
    The electrical definitions in this standard are not intended to accommodate high-bandwidth
    applications such as radar or video imagery, or intensive database or file transfer
    applications. Since there is no provision for guaranteed delivery of messages
    and only limited error checking capability, this standard should be used with
    caution in all safety applications. For applications where a faster transmission
    rate is necessary, reference should be made to IEC 61162-2. For applications to
    shore based equipment of the automatic identification system (AIS) reference should
    be made to the IEC 62320 series. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2010, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new identifiers have been added to Table 4;<br />\r\n- the
    sentences CBR and MEB have been removed as they are now solely used by AIS shore
    based equipment;<br />\r\n- new sentences ACN, ALC, ALF, ARC, EPV, HCR, HRM, MOB,
    NSR, RLM, RRT, SM1, SM2, SM3, SM4, SMB, SPW and TRL have been added;<br />\r\n-
    revisions have been made to ABK, ABM, GNS, NAK, NRM, RMC, ROR and TTD;<br />\r\n-
    the methods of testing in Annex B have been revised."
