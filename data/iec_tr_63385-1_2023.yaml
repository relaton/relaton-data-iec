abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63385-1:2023 provides a catalogue of the architecture and principles
    of measurement of short-range radars that are widely exploited in civil applications.
    The applications are related to the detection of the target for obstacle avoidance,
    motion sensing, or identification of devices. The mass civil use of radars sometimes
    creates compatibility issues among the services. The performance of each radar
    system is guaranteed in the field without any harmful interference but the frequency
    allocation using theoretical calculations does not consider the latest mitigation
    technologies. In order to increase the efficiency of the system usage without
    any degradation of the performance of the radars, this document provides clarification
    on the characteristics of the radar systems and additional information on applications
    in the field.
