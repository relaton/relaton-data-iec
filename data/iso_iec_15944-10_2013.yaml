abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    primary purpose of ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 is to provide, in a single consolidated
    document, an integrated approach for the key concepts and their definitions as
    well as rules pertaining to \"coded domains\" as they already exist in the multipart
    ISO/IEC 15944 eBusiness standard, especially Parts 1, 2, 5 and 8. It does so in
    a systematic and rules-based manner. As such, ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 serves as
    a methodology and tool for an IT-enabled approach to existing widely used standards,
    specifications, authority files, pick-lists, etc., of a \"codes representing X\"
    nature, i.e. as ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 compliant coded domains, involving the making
    of (legally-binding) commitments, based on common business practices.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-10:2013 specifies the five key characteristics of coded domains and identifies
    twelve benefits of the use of coded domains. A key purpose of ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013
    is to maximize and state very explicitly the level of \"intelligence\" at the
    highest and most precise required level with respect to the semantics of the actual
    data being interchanged among autonomous parties in a business transaction. Here
    the use of coded domains presents a simple and very pragmatic approach at the
    data element, i.e. semantic component level. It focuses on the development of
    intelligently coded data elements as part of coded domains. This involves rule-based,
    structured and pre-defined values whose purpose and use has been clearly stated
    and unambiguously defined (thereby facilitating an IT-enabled approach).<br />\r\nIn
    an Open-edi and eBusiness context ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 supports the use of coded
    domains as re-useable business objects among participating parties in any type
    of business transaction. Coded domains can be used is support of any type of scenario
    component, i.e. \"roles\", and \"Information Bundles (IBs)\", and \"semantic components
    (SCs)\", as well as scenario attributes. Re-use of coded domains is supported
    through coded domains being registered through procedures specified in ISO/IEC
    15944-2.<br />\r\nThe semantics of the data values in a coded domain are identified
    and referenced via unique and unambiguous \"ID codes\", i.e. as unique identifiers.
    With such unambiguous and unique ID codes, in ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 compliant
    coded domains can be associated multiple human interface equivalents (HIEs) in
    many forms and languages. The approach taken here is that of the separation of
    the (single) IT interface requirements of semantic interoperability from their
    (multiple) human interface (linguistic) equivalents (required by the jurisdictional
    domains of the participating parties as well as those of an individual accessibility
    nature). Use of ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 therefore facilitates semantic interoperability
    requirements of both jurisdictional domains and all kinds of parties to a business
    transaction [including where the buyer is an individual, and public policy requirements
    apply (e.g. consumer protection, privacy protection, individual accessibility,
    etc.)].<br />\r\nIn addition to its twelve normative clauses and two normative
    annexes, ISO/IEC 15944-10:2013 provides extensive informative text in its Clause
    0 \"Introduction\" and six informative annexes."
