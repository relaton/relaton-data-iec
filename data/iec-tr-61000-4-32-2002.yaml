  content: Provides information about extant system-level high-altitude EMP (HEMP)
    simulators and their applicability as test facilities and validation tools for
    immunity test requirements. This report provides the first detailed listing of
    HEMP simulators throughout the worldand is the preliminary summary of this effort.
    It should be updated on a regular basis as the status of test facilities change.
    The main body of the report is a collection of datasheets describing 42 EMP simulators
    in 14 countries that are still operational or could be made available for use
    by the international community.
