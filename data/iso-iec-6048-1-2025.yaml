    <p><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies an image coding technology known as JPEG AI learning-based image coding (JPEG AI) comprising an image coding technology that facilitates the compression and processing of images for both human and machine vision. The scope of the JPEG AI document is the creation of a learning-based image coding standard offering a single-stream, compact compressed domain representation, targeting both human visualization, with significant compression efficiency improvement over image coding standards in common use at equivalent subjective quality, and effective performance for image processing and computer vision tasks.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-GB">The core coding system describes JPEG AI standard for the human vision reconstruction task and thus specifies the JPEG AI specifies the parsing coded stream and the image reconstruction process. Only the syntax format, semantics, and associated decoding process requirements are specified, while other matters such as pre-processing, the encoding process, system signalling and multiplexing, data loss recovery, post-processing, and video display are considered to be outside the scope of this document.</span></p>
    <p><span lang="EN-GB">This document is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide range of applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services. In the course of creating this document, several requirements from typical applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements have been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence, this document is designed to facilitate image data interchange among different applications and services.</span></p>
