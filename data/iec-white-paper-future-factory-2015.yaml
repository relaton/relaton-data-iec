  content: "What will manufacturing look like in the future? How will humans and machines
    communicate with each other? Will our work environment adapt to our needs?<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the factory of the future humans will have to come to terms
    with an increasing complexity of processes, machines and components. This will
    require new operating concepts for optimized human-machine interaction.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nNimble, adaptive and intelligent manufacturing processes will be the measurement
    of success. The combination of “virtual” and “real” in order to get a full view
    of the complete value chain will allow factories to produce products more rapidly,
    more efﬁciently and with greater return using fewer resources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    White Paper will assess the potential worldwide needs, beneﬁts, concepts and preconditions
    for the factory of the future. It identiﬁes the business trends in related technologies
    and markets, as well as their impact on data, people, technologies and standards.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board
    (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>) in cooperation with the Fraunhofer
    Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation IPA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    IEC White Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/factory-future\">free
