  content: "IEC 61000-4-6:2008 RLV contains the International Standard and its Redline
    version. The Redline version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between this standard and its previous edition. The Redline version
    is not an official IEC Standard, only the current version of the standard is to
    be considered the official document.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-6:2008 relates to the
    conducted immunity requirements of electrical and electronic equipment to electromagnetic
    disturbances coming from intended radio-frequency (RF) transmitters in the frequency
    range 9 kHz up to 80 MHz. Equipment not having at least one conducting cable (such
    as mains supply, signal line or earth connection) which can couple the equipment
    to the disturbing RF fields is excluded. The object of IEC 61000-4-6:2008 is to
    establish a common reference for evaluating the functional immunity of electrical
    and electronic equipment when subjected to conducted disturbances induced by radio-frequency
    fields. The test method documented in this part of IEC 61000 describes a consistent
    method to assess the immunity of an equipment or system against a defined phenomenon.
    IEC 61000-4-6:2008 has the status of a basic EMC publication in accordance with
    IEC Guide 107. This third edition of IEC 61000-4-6:2008 cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2003, Amendment 1 (2004) and Amendment 2 (2006). This
    edition constitutes a technical revision."
