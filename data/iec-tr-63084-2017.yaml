  content: IEC TR 63084:2017(E) provides an assessment framework and activities for
    efficient and transparent qualification of I&C platforms for use in nuclear applications
    important to safety, according to nuclear standards and state of the art. The
    assessment aims at a pre-qualification of I&C platforms outside the framework
    of a specific plant design. Qualification is assumed to be pre-requisite for allowing
    the particular I&C platform to be used for implementation of the safety classified
    I&C system. It is to enable parties implementing particular plant specific I&C
    systems to concentrate on application functions, while for basic system functions
    to rely on platform qualification. Basic means of equipment qualification, as
    prescribed by the IEC/IEEE 60780-323, are through analysis, type testing and documented
    operational experience. Other documents applicable for qualification for nuclear
    use include IEC 61513, IEC 60880, IEC 62138, IEC 62566, IEC 62671 and IEC 61226.
