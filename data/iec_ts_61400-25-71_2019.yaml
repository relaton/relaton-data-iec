abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-25-71:2019 focus on the communications between wind power
    plant components such as wind turbines and actors such as SCADA systems. Non­-IEC
    61850/IEC 61400-25 internal communication within wind power plant components is
    outside the normative scope of the IEC 61400-25 series.<br />\r\nThis document
    describes how to extend the IEC 61400-25 series with the IEC 61850­6 Substation
    Configuration description Language (SCL) file format for describing communication­-related
    Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) configurations of a wind turbine, wind power
    plant controller, meteorological mast, etc. The extension of SCL to the wind domain
    is intended to simplify integration of wind power plant equipment for clients,
    as well as their integration to the electrical system. The adoption of SCL allows
    formalised tool-based exchange of IED parameters, communication system configurations,
    switch yard (function) structures, as well as description of the relations between
    them.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this format is to formally and efficiently exchange
    wind turbine and wind power plant IED capability descriptions, and system descriptions
    between IED engineering tools and the system engineering tool(s) of different
    manufacturers in a compatible way. The file format is also intended to provide
    report configuration and alarms as well as HMI interface information from a wind
    power plant. This information can be used to engineer overlying SCADA systems
    for the site, for connected DSO, or TSO, or for fleet operators' maintenance and
    surveillance systems. Finally, the SCL is intended as a documentation of the configuration
    and topology of the delivered system."
