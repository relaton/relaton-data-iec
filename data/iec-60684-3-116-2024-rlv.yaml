  content: "IEC 60684-3-116:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-116:2024
    gives the requirements for non-heat-shrinkable sleeving, extruded from compounds
    based on polychloroprene elastomer. This sleeving has been found suitable for
    temperatures up to 95 °C. Sleeving of this type is normally available with internal
    diameters up to 25 mm, and in the following opaque colours: black, brown, red,
    orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, grey, white and pink. Sizes or colours other
    than those specifically listed in this document can possibly be available as custom
    items. These items are considered to comply with this document if they comply
    with the other property requirements listed in Table 2. Materials which conform
    to this specification meet established levels of performance. However, the selection
    of a material by a user for a specific application will be based on the actual
    requirements necessary for adequate performance in the application and not based
    on the specification alone. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2010 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) update of clause references in Table 2;<br />\r\nb) addition of resistance
    to fluids test."
