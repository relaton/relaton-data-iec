abstract:
- content: Specifies the procedures to be followed by a Registration Authority in
    preparing, maintaining and publishing a register of identifiers allocated to the
    methods concerned. Except the identifiers the registration does not affect the
    status of the method. Thus, the registration procedure must be clearly distinguished
    from the standardization process.
