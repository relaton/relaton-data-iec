    <p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge</p>
    <p>containing a memory chip to enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the</p>
    <p>recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format - called Advanced Intelligent Tape No. 1 with Memory In</p>
    <p>Cartridge (AIT-1 with MIC) - thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.</p>
    <p>The System Log is recorded in the MIC.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies two types of cartridge depending on the thickness of the magnetic tape contained in the</p>
    <p>case.</p>
    <p>Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the</p>
    <p>interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p>
