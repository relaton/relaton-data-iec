abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63335:2021 identifies a number of issues of particular importance
    to light water Small Modular Reactors (SMRs), which are not currently adequately
    addressed by existing IEC SC 45A standards, and that could be considered when
    revising existing publications or that could be the object of new work item proposals.
    Whether each of these issues will indeed be addressed, and if so in which publication,
    will be the decision of each SC 45A working group. Though there are a number of
    advanced Generation IV SMR projects underway, their specific needs are not covered
    by this document.
