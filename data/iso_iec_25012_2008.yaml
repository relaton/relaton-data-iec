abstract:
- content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 defines a general
    data quality model for data retained in a structured format within a computer
    system.</p><p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 can be used to establish data quality requirements,
    define data quality measures, or plan and perform data quality evaluations. It
    could be used, for example,</p><ul><li>to define and evaluate data quality requirements
    in data production, acquisition and integration processes,</li><li>to identify
    data quality assurance criteria, also useful for re-engineering, assessment and
    improvement of data,</li><li>to evaluate the compliance of data with legislation
    and/or requirements.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 categorizes quality attributes
    into fifteen characteristics considered by two points of view: inherent and system
    dependent. Data quality characteristics will be of varying importance and priority
    to different stakeholders.</p><p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 is intended to be used in
    conjunction with the other parts of the SQuaRE series of International Standards,
    and with ISO/IEC 9126-1 until superseded by ISO/IEC 25010.</p>'
