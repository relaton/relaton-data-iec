abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 25012:2008 defines a general data quality model for data retained
    in a structured format within a computer system.ISO/IEC 25012:2008 can be used
    to establish data quality requirements, define data quality measures, or plan
    and perform data quality evaluations. It could be used, for example, to define
    and evaluate data quality requirements in data production, acquisition and integration
    processes,to identify data quality assurance criteria, also useful for re-engineering,
    assessment and improvement of data,to evaluate the compliance of data with legislation
    and/or requirements.ISO/IEC 25012:2008 categorizes quality attributes into fifteen
    characteristics considered by two points of view: inherent and system dependent.
    Data quality characteristics will be of varying importance and priority to different
    stakeholders.ISO/IEC 25012:2008 is intended to be used in conjunction with the
    other parts of the SQuaRE series of International Standards, and with ISO/IEC
    9126-1 until superseded by ISO/IEC 25010.'
