abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-69:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-69:2016 deals
    with the safety of electrical motor-operated vacuum cleaners, including back-pack
    vacuum cleaners, and dust extractors, for wet suction, dry suction, or wet and
    dry suction, intended for commercial indoor or outdoor use with or without attachments.
    They may be provided with a blowing or inflating function. It also deals with
    the safety of centrally-sited vacuum cleaners, excluding the installation of the
    system. Requirements on the safe installation of centrally-sited vacuum cleaners
    are not addressed by this standard but need to be taken into account. This standard
    applies to machines for commercial use. The following list, although not comprehensive,
    gives an indication of locations that are included in the scope:<br />\r\n- public
    use areas such as hotels, schools, hospitals;<br />\r\n- industrial locations,
    for example factories and manufacturing shops;<br />\r\n- retail outlets, for
    example shops and supermarkets;<br />\r\n- business premises, for example offices
    and banks and<br />\r\n- all uses other than normal housekeeping purposes. They
    are not equipped with a traction drive. The following power systems are covered:
    mains powered motors up to a rated voltage of 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances, and battery powered motors. This standard also
    applies to machines handling hazardous dust, such as asbestos. This standard does
    not apply to:<br />\r\n- vacuum cleaners and water-suction cleaning appliances
    for household use;<br />\r\n- floor treatment machines for commercial use;<br
    />\r\n- spray extraction machines for commercial use;<br />\r\n- hand-held mains-operated
    electrical garden blowers, vacuums and blower vacuums;<br />\r\n- hand-held and
    transportable motor-operated electric tools;<br />\r\n- appliances for medical
    purposes;<br />\r\n- machines designed for use in corrosive environments;<br />\r\n-
    machines designed for picking up liquids with a flash point below 55 Â°C and machines
    designed for use in explosive environments (dust, vapour or gas), except those
    designed for use in zone 22. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2012. It constitutes a technical revision. The principal
    changes in this edition as compared with the third edition of IEC 60335-2-69 are
    as follows (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\n- the scope has been revised
    editorially to avoid misunderstandings;<br />\r\n- terms and definitions has been
    revised with regard to the requirements revised;<br />\r\n- the standard has been
    revised in general and updated regarding state-of-the-art, as far as necessary,
    in particular some changes have been made to Clauses 15, 22 and 25;<br />\r\n-
    the standard has been aligned with the newest amendment of IEC 60335-1:2010+A1:2013;<br
    />\r\n- Annex AA was revised and restructured;<br />\r\n- Annex CC was revised;<br
    />\r\n- general additions for vacuum cleaners with blowing functions have been
    introduced and a new Annex GG 'Particular requirements for mobile wet vacuum cleaners
    for rescue and firefighting services (MWF)' was added. It was established on the
    basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard. The attention of National
    Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations
    may need a<br />\r\ntransitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new
    requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is
    the recommendation of the committee that the content of this<br />\r\npublication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than
    36 months from the date of its publication.<br />\r\nKey word"
