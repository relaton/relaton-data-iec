abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9594-1:2008 gives an overview of the concepts, models and services
    related to “The Directory”. The Directory provides the directory capabilities
    required by OSI applications, OSI management processes, other OSI layer entities,
    and telecommunications services. Among the capabilities which it provides are
    those of "user-friendly naming", whereby objects can be referred to by names which
    are suitable for citing by human users (though not all objects need have user-friendly
    names), and "name-to-address mapping", which allows the binding between objects
    and their locations to be dynamic. The latter capability allows OSI networks,
    for example, to be "self-configuring" in the sense that addition, removal and
    changes of object location do not affect OSI network operation.The Directory is
    not intended to be a general-purpose database system, although it may be built
    on such systems. It is assumed, for instance, that, as is typical with communications
    directories, there is a considerably higher frequency of "queries" than of updates.
    The rate of updates is expected to be governed by the dynamics of people and organizations,
    rather than, for example, the dynamics of networks. There is also no need for
    instantaneous global commitment of updates; transient conditions, where both old
    and new versions of the same information are available, are quite acceptable.It
    is a characteristic of the Directory that, except as a consequence of differing
    access rights or unpropagated updates, the results of directory queries will not
    be dependent on the identity or location of the enquirer. This characteristic
    renders the Directory unsuitable for some telecommunications applications, for
    example some types of routing. For cases where the results are dependent on the
    identity of the enquirer, access to directory information and updates of the Directory
    may be denied.
