abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 27031:2011 describes the concepts and principles of information
    and comunication technology (ICT) readiness for business continuity, and provides
    a framework of methods and processes to identify and specify all aspects (such
    as performance criteria, design, and implementation) for improving an organization's
    ICT readiness to ensure business continuity. It applies to any organization (private,
    governmental, and non-governmental, irrespective of size) developing its ICT readiness
    for business continuity program (IRBC), and requiring its ICT services/infrastructures
    to be ready to support business operations in the event of emerging events and
    incidents, and related disruptions, that could affect continuity (including security)
    of critical business functions. It also enables an organization to measure performance
    parameters that correlate to its IRBC in a consistent and recognized manner.The
    scope of ISO/IEC 27031:2011 encompasses all events and incidents (including security
    related) that could have an impact on ICT infrastructure and systems. It includes
    and extends the practices of information security incident handling and management
    and ICT readiness planning and services.
