  content: Describes the design features and performance characteristics of a.c. motors
    specifically designed for use on converter supplies. Also specifies the interface
    parameters and interactions between the motor and the converter including installation
    guidance as part of a power drive system. The scope of this second edition has
    been extended to include all converter-fed motors, in addition to low voltage
    induction motors.
