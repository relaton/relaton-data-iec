  content: "IEC 60127-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60127-1:2023
    covers the general requirements and tests applicable to all types of miniature
    fuse-links (e.g. cartridge fuse-links, sub-miniature fuse-links, universal modular
    fuse-links and miniature fuse-links for special applications) for the protection
    of electric appliances, electronic equipment and component parts thereof normally
    intended to be used indoors. This document does not apply to fuses intended for
    the protection of low-voltage electrical installations. These are covered by IEC
    60269, Low Voltage Fuses. Specific details covering each major subdivision are
    given in subsequent parts. This document does not apply to fuses for appliances
    intended to be used under special conditions, such as in a corrosive or explosive
    atmos­phere.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is<br />\r\n- to establish uniform
    requirements for miniature fuses so as to protect appliances or parts of appliances
    in the most suitable way,<br />\r\n- to define the performance of the fuses, so
    as to give guidance to designers of electrical appliances and electronic equipment
    and to ensure replacement of fuse-links by those of similar dimensions and characteristics,<br
    />\r\n- to define methods of testing,<br />\r\n- to define maximum sustained dissipation
    of fuse-links to ensure good compatibility of stated power acceptance when used
    with fuse-holders according to this document (see IEC 60127-6)."
