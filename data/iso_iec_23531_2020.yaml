abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the capabilities of issue management tools and
    is used to select the most appropriate one from many issue management tools. The
    evaluation and selection of the issue management tools is performed in accordance
    with ISO/IEC 20741 which defines the general evaluation selection process and
    evaluation characteristics. Issue management is based on the tasks described in
    several activities in their processes (e.g. project assessment and control, decision
    management, and system/software requirements definition) of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.</p><p>This
    document is independent of development methodology or approaches (e.g. Waterfall
    or Agile) or lifecycle processes (e.g. implementation or operation).</p>"
