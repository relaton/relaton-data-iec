abstract:
- content: "IEC 61747-30-3:2019(E) applies to transmissive type active matrix liquid
    crystal displays.<br />\r\nThis document defines general procedures for quality
    evaluation related to the motion performance of transmissive thin film transistor
    (TFT) LCDs. It defines artefacts in the moving image and methods for motion artefact
    measurement.<br />\r\nNOTE Motion blur measurement methods and analysis methods
    introduced in this document are not universal tools for all the different LCD
    motion enhancement technologies due to their complexity. Users’ attention is drawn
    to this fact.<br />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    of IEC 61747-6-3 published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added test positions and areas;<br />\r\nb)
    revised standard measuring conditions;<br />\r\nc) added calculation of the standard
    deviation of the line-spread function of the eye;<br />\r\nd) added requirements
    for high speed camera;<br />\r\ne) changed “LCDs” to “transmissive TFT LCDs” in
    Clause 1."
