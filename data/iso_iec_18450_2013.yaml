abstract:
- content: "<p>Web Services Description Language (WSDL) is an XML schema for describing
    Web services and how they can be accessed by Web based applications. WSDL facilitates
    the creation and deployment of web based applications. For example, by using WSDL
    with many industry Web services development environments, a web services developer
    can access features provided by an implementation without knowing details of the
    network or underlying transport protocols.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18450:2013 specifies
    two WSDL documents: Computing Function WSDL and Switching Function WSDL, for ISO/IEC
    18051, Services for Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications (CSTA)
    Phase III. All CSTA features (e.g., services and events) specified in ISO/IEC
    18051 are specified in ISO/IEC 18450:2013. ISO/IEC 18450:2013 specifies pairs
    of port types, one from the Computing Function WSDL and one from the Switching
    Function WSDL, for all the profiles specified in ISO/IEC 18051.</p><p>A full WSDL
    document contains both abstract definitions (WSDL messages and port type elements)
    and concrete protocol specific definitions (WSDL bindings, ports, and service
    elements). This CSTA WSDL Standard specifies only the abstract definitions of
    a WSDL document. The concrete and protocol specific definitions are implementation
    specific and are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18450:2013. Annex B illustrates
    an example SOAP over HTTP binding.</p><p>WSDL is defined in XML and XML Schemata.
    ISO/IEC 18450:2013 builds upon the XML data types and imports all message formats
    specified in ISO/IEC 18056.</p><p>Annex A specifies mechanisms to establish event
    channels based on WS-Eventing. The event channels allow the Switching Function
    and Computing Function to be both a Service Requester and a Service Provider.</p>"
