abstract:
- content: "IEC 60156:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60156:2018
    specifies the method for determining the dielectric breakdown voltage of insulating
    liquids at power frequency. The test procedure is performed in a specified apparatus,
    where the oil sample is subjected to an increasing AC electrical field until breakdown
    occurs. The method applies to all types of insulating liquids of nominal viscosity
    up to 350 mm2/s at 40 Â°C. It is appropriate both for acceptance testing on unused
    liquids at the time of their delivery and for establishing the condition of samples
    taken in monitoring and maintenance of equipment. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 1995. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision and, mainly, confirms the content of the previous edition even if some
    advances are included. The test method has not been changed for practical reason
    due to the very large number of instrumentation disseminated around the world,
    even if the use of stirring is now recommended."
