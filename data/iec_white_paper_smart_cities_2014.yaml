abstract:
- content: "By 2050, it is projected that 67% of the global population will live in
    cities. Smart Cities are necessary to reduce emissions and to handle this rapid
    urban growth.<br /><br />\r\nHowever cities, as we know them, are faced with a
    complex challenge â€“ the traditional processes of planning, procuring and financing
    are not adequate for the needs of Smart Cities. Their development requires the
    right environment for smart solutions to be effectively adopted and used.<br /><br
    />\r\nElectricity is core in any urban infrastructure system and the key enabler
    of cities development, so IEC has a specific role to play in the development of
    Smart City Standards. Delivering the full value of Standards to accelerate the
    development of Smart Cities and lower its costs also clearly needs a strong collaboration
    of all city stakeholders.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper explains what it needs
    to move cities to greater smartness; the what, who and how of Smart City development.
    It calls for a wide collaboration between many stakeholders, including other international
    standardization bodies to ultimately lead to integrated, cost-efficient, and sustainable
    solutions.<br /><br />\r\nThe development of this White Paper was led by the IEC
    MSB (Market Strategy Board) project team on Smart Cities in cooperation with CEPS
    (Centre for European Policy Studies). The MSB brings together CTOs of leading
    international organizations.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available
    for free download."
