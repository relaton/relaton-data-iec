abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-63:2015 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 960 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and
    Medical (ISM) band used in item management applications. It provides a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. This part of ISO/IEC 18000 is intended to allow for
    compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID
    market in the international marketplace. It defines the forward and return link
    parameters for technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency,
    operating channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic
    radiated power (EIRP), spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding,
    bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating
    channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate.
    It further defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18000-63:2015 specifies the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter,
    Interrogator-Talks-First (ITF) systems. The system comprises Interrogators, also
    known as readers, and tags, also known as labels. An Interrogator receives information
    from a tag by transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag
    responds by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering
    an information signal to the Interrogator. The system is ITF, meaning that a tag
    modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal only after
    being directed to do so by an Interrogator.<br />\r\nIn detail, ISO/IEC 18000-63:2015
    contains Type C.<br />\r\nType C uses PIE in the forward link and a random slotted
    collision-arbitration algorithm.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-63:2015 specifies<br />\r\n-
    physical interactions (the signalling layer of the communication link) between
    Interrogators and tags,<br />\r\n- logical operating procedures and commands between
    Interrogators and Tags,<br />\r\n- the collision arbitration scheme used to identify
    a specific tag in a multiple-tag environment,<br />\r\n- optional security commands
    that allow the use of crypto suites of ISO/IEC 29167."
