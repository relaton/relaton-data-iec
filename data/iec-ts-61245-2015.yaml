  content: "IEC TS 61245:2015(E) is applicable for the determination of the d.c. withstand
    characteristics of ceramic and glass insulators to be used outdoors and exposed
    to polluted atmospheres, on d.c. systems with the highest voltage of the system
    greater than +/- 1 000 V. These tests are not applicable to polymeric insulators,
    to greased insulators or to special types of insulators (e.g. insulators with
    semiconducting glaze or covered with any organic insulating material). The object
    of this technical specification is to prescribe procedures for artificial pollution
    tests applicable to insulators for overhead lines, substations and traction lines
    and to bushings. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 1993. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Corrections and the addition of explanatory material;<br />\r\nb) The
    addition of Clause 4.4.2 on atmospheric correction;<br />\r\nc) The change of
    upper limit of volume conductivity of tap water for insulator cleaning to 0,1
    S/m;<br />\r\nd) The extension to UHV voltages; and<br />\r\ne) The addition of
    Annex B \"Determination of the withstand characteristics of insulators\" and Annex
    E \"Supplementary information on artificial pollution tests on insulators for
    voltage systems of +/- 600 kV and above (solid layer method procedure B).<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of August 2018 have been included in this copy."
