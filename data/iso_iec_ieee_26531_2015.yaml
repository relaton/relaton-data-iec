abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531:2015 states requirements for efficient development and
    management of content produced - throughout the life-cycle of a system and software
    product; - for the provision of user documentation for systems and software; -
    for the management of IT services. ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531:2015 is independent of the
    tools, protocols, and systems used for content management. It does not address
    configuration management of software assets. The content to be managed with this
    standard includes - user information such as topic collections, manuals, guides,
    embedded user assistance, style guides, videos and other media, and other content
    that supports the effective use of a system or software product; - product life
    cycle information such as design documents, use cases, personas, project management
    plans, feature requests, models, scripts, testing plans, test scripts, defect
    reports; - service management items such as service-level agreements, records,
    policies, procedures, and other documents. The purpose of ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531:2015
    is to define a process for content management and the requirements of a component
    content management system through which content is gathered, managed, and published,
    including the requirements of a system that is supported by an electronic database.
    Such a database should support documents or topics and content units that may
    be assembled to produce complete documents for print, electronic output, or content
    collections published through electronic media. This database is defined as a
    Component Content Management System (CCMS), which differs from a document management
    system. The objective of component content management is to create content objects
    once and use them through linking mechanisms in multiple output formats, including
    but not limited to documents.
