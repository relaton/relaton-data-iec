abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23009-6:2017 specifies carriage of MPEG-DASH media presentations
    over full duplex HTTP-compatible protocols, particularly HTTP/2 and WebSocket.
    This carriage takes advantage of the features these protocols support over HTTP/1.1
    to improve delivery performance, while still maintaining backwards compatibility,
    particularly for the delivery of low latency live video.
