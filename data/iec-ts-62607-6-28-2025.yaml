  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-28:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    two standardized methods to determine the key control characteristic<br />\r\n•
    number of layers<br />\r\nfor graphene layers by<br />\r\n• Raman spectroscopy.<br
    />\r\nThis document presents two complementary methods for determining the number
    of layers in graphene-related products: Method A, which analyzes the lineshape
    of the 2D-peak in the Raman spectrum, and Method B, which measures the Raman intensity
    from the underlying silicon substrate. The two methods can be employed individually
    but combining both methods enhances accuracy and extends the detection range for
    the number of layers and stacking configurations.<br />\r\n- The method is intended
    to be used for graphene layers prepared by mechanical exfoliation, but also can
    be used with care for other high quality graphene layers, such as graphene layers
    prepared by chemical vapor deposition.<br />\r\n- The method can be used for graphene
    layers with AB and ABC stacking on a substrate. Its lateral size should be at
    least 2 µm.<br />\r\n- Method A is effective for AB stacked graphene up to 4 layers
    but becomes less reliable with more layers due to peak overlap.<br />\r\n- Method
    B can detect up to 10 layers in AB and ABC stacking but oxidized silicon substrate
    (SiO2 on silicon substrate) is required.<br />\r\n- The comparison of Method A
    and Method B can be found in Annex A."
