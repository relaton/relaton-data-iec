abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/TR 18268:2013(E) presents a collation of industry experience of
    technical issues resulting from the presence of multiple PICCs (proximity card
    or object) in the field of a PCD (proximity coupling device). It describes how
    resonance frequencies may shift, how individual PICCs may see a reduced field
    strength, how multiple PICCs load the PCD, how they may change the local modulation
    signal and how PICCs should manage their identities to aid support of simultaneous
    usage. Scenarios for electronic passports with multiple visas and wallets containing
    multi-industry cards are explored.
