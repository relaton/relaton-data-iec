    <p>ISO/IEC TR 24725-1:2011 provides a framework and objectives to assist in the development of profiles and platform and media bundles for information technology supporting learning, education, and training. These profiles and bundles will define conforming subsets or combinations of base standards used to provide specific functions in information technology for learning, education, and training (ITLET). </p>
    <p>It also provides a proposed architecture that can be used to further the development of profiles and platform and media bundle combinations that are used to accomplish a specific function or purpose. This development work will involve the identification of standards, together with appropriate classes, conforming subsets, options and parameters, which are necessary to accomplish identified functions or to support a class of applications for learners within various information technology environments.</p>
