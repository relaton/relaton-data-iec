abstract:
- content: "IEC 62714-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62714-1:2018
    is a solution for data exchange focusing on the domain of automation engineering.
    The data exchange format defined in the IEC 62714 series (Automation Markup Language,
    AML) is an XML schema based data format and has been developed in order to support
    the data exchange in a heterogeneous engineering tools landscape. The goal of
    AML is to interconnect engineering tools in their different disciplines, e.g.
    mechanical plant engineering, electrical design, process engineering, process
    control engineering, HMI development, PLC programming, robot programming, etc.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    use of CAEX 3.0 according to IEC 62424:2016<br />\r\nb) improved modelling of
    references to documents outside of the scope of the present standard,<br />\r\nc)
    modelling of references between CAEX attributes and items in external documents,<br
    />\r\nd) revised role libraries,<br />\r\ne) modified Port concept,<br />\r\nf)
    modelling of multilingual expressions,<br />\r\ng) modelling of structured attribute
    lists or array,<br />\r\nh) a new AML container format,<br />\r\ni) a new standard
    AML attribute library"
