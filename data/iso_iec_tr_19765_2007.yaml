abstract:
- content: "<p>Different users of information technology products possess different
    sets of abilities. Some abilities may not ever be present in a user as they may
    have been born without them. Some abilities are acquired, developed or deteriorate
    over time due to education, maturity, injury, illness or age. Just as it is possible
    that a user possesses a combination of abilities, it is also possible that they
    may lack a combination of abilities.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 19765:2007 presents icons
    and symbols currently used to provide access to facilities and tools to support
    the needs of elderly and disabled users of information technology (IT) products,
    and could form the basis of a future International Standard which would provide
    a recommended collection of icons and symbols.</p><p>These icons and symbols have
    been collected from a variety of sources including other standards, contemporary
    software products, web sites and hardware devices. These sources are cross-referenced
    and listed in a bibliography.</p><p>The icons and symbols presented in ISO/IEC
    TR 19765:2007 are categorized by modality and method of use.</p>"
