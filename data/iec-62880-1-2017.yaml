  content: IEC 62880-1:2017(E) describes a constant temperature (isothermal) aging
    method for testing copper (Cu) metallization test structures on microelectronics
    wafers for susceptibility to stress-induced voiding (SIV). This method is to be
    conducted primarily at the wafer level of production during technology development,
    and the results are to be used for lifetime prediction and failure analysis. Under
    some conditions, the method can be applied to package-level testing. This method
    is not intended to check production lots for shipment, because of the long test
    time.
