abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of test procedures designed to verify
    whether bitstreams and decoders meet requirements specified in ISO/IEC 23092-1
    and ISO/IEC 23092-2.</p><p>Procedures are described for testing conformity of
    bitstreams and decoders to the requirements that are fully determined in ISO/IEC
    23092-1 and ISO/IEC 23092-2. This document identifies those requirements, associates
    them to functionality under test and defines how conformity with them can be tested.
    Test bitstreams implemented according to those functionalities are provided in
    electronic form.</p>"
