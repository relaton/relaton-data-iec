abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a set of tests and procedures designed to verify
    whether bitstreams and decoders meet normative requirements specified in ISO/IEC
    23094-2. An encoder can claim conformance to ISO/IEC 23094-2 if the bitstreams
    that it generates are conforming bitstreams. Characteristics of coded bitstreams
    and decoders are defined in ISO/IEC 23094-2. Decoder characteristics define the
    properties and capabilities of the applied decoding process. The capabilities
    of a decoder specify which bitstreams the decoder can decode and reconstruct.
    A bitstream can be decoded by a decoder if the characteristics of the bitstream
    are within the specified decoder capabilities.<br /><br />\r\nThis document includes
    an electronic attachment containing the conformance bitstreams identified within
    the text and the reference software. The electronic attachment is available here."
