  content: IEC 62899-202-9:2023 describes basic patterns to evaluate the electrical
    reliability of a conductive layer under mechanical deformation. Using the standard
    pattern described in this document, the comparison of the electrical reliability
    of a conductive layer under mechanical deformation is possible when the sample
    dimension is identical.
