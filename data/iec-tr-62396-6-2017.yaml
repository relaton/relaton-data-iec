  content: IEC TR 62396-6:2017 is a technical report which provides information intended
    to improve the understanding of extreme space weather events; it details the mechanisms
    and conditions that produce “extreme space weather” (ESW) as a result of a large
    increase in the activity on the surface of the sun and it discusses the potential
    radiation environment based on projection of previous recorded ESW.
