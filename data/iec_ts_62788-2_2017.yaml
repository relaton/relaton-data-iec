abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62788-2:2017(E) defines test methods and datasheet reporting requirements
    for safety and performance related properties (mechanical, electrical, thermal,
    optical and chemical) of non-rigid polymeric materials intended for use in terrestrial
    photovoltaic modules as polymeric frontsheets and backsheets. The test methods
    define how to characterize backsheet and frontsheet materials and their components
    in a manner representative of how they will be used in the module, which eventually
    includes combination with other matched components such as encapsulant or adhesives.
    The methods described in this document support the safety and performance related
    tests defined on PV module level as defined in the series IEC 61730 and IEC 61215.
    This document also defines test methods for assessment of inherent material characteristics
    of polymeric backsheets and frontsheets or their components.
