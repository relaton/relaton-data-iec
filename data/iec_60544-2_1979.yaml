abstract:
- content: Specifies the controls which shall be maintained over the exposure conditions
    during and following the irradiation of insulating materials with ionizing radiation
    prior to the determination of radiation-induced changes in physical or chemical
    properties. A number of potentially significant irradiation conditions are discussed
    and various parameters which can influence the radiation-induced reactions under
    these conditions are specified. Example test reports for a number of materials
    are also included in appendix A of this standard.
