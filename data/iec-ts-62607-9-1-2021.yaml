  content: IEC TS 62607-9-1:2021(E) establishes a standardized method to characterize
    spatially varying magnetic fields with a spatial resolution down to 10 nm for
    flat magnetic specimens by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). MFM primarily detects
    the stray field component perpendicular to the sample surface. The resolution
    is achieved by the calibration of the MFM tip using magnetically nanostructured
    reference materials.
