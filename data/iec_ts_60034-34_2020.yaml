abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60034-34:2020 is applicable to AC adjustable speed rolling mill
    motors and identifies specific requirements for AC adjustable speed rolling mill
    motors, where those performance characteristics are different from those for conventional
    AC motors.<br />\r\nVarious types of overload capacity conditions and overloads
    are defined. The possible effect on motor insulation life due to operating the
    motor beyond its design capability is discussed.<br />\r\nRequirements for confirmation
    of motor under specified variable speed operational conditions are introduced."
