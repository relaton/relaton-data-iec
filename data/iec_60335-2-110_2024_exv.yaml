abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-110:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 60335-2-110:2024 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-110:2024 deals with the safety
    of microwave appliances intended for commercial use, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase and
    neutral and 480 V for other appliances.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by these types of appliances.<br
    />\r\nAppliances covered by this standard incorporate an open-ended applicator
    for treatment of the load. They are divided into three types:<br />\r\n- with
    insertion applicator, typically for moisture removal by insertion into holes in
    floors, walls or ceilings;<br />\r\n- with large area contacting applicator, typically
    for drying of floors, walls or ceilings;<br />\r\n- with small area contacting
    applicator, typically for paint removal and spot-heating.<br />\r\nMicrowave appliances
    with insertion applicator, large area contacting applicator or small area contacting
    applicator are using electromagnetic energy in one or several of the ISM frequency
    bands between 300 MHz and 30 GHz, for supplying energy to an external load which
    is heated so that a resulting process of drying, moisture transport which can
    result in forces due to formation of steam, decomposition or chemical modification,
    melting, or termination of organisms such as bacteria or fungus occurs.<br />\r\nAppliances
    with insertion applicator and with large area contacting applicator are portable
    appliances. Appliances with small area contacting applicator are handheld appliances.<br
    />\r\nAppliances that use non-electrical energy are within the scope of this standard.
    The microwave-related portion is considered motor-operated.<br />\r\nThe rationales
    for the microwave barrier and associated leakage tests are described in informative
    Annex AA.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- these appliances
    can radiate microwave energy outside a restricted area where they are used. The
    additional requirements specified by national authorities responsible for the
    protection for non-ionising radiation that the limit of power flux density is
    10 W/m2, averaged over any time period of 6 min, outside this restricted area
    is taken into consideration in this standard;<br />\r\n- these appliances are
    intended to exclusively treat the load in normal operation, i.e. this standard
    does not apply to appliances or systems employing free space microwave propagation;<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in tropical countries, special requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, and national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and for non-ionising radiation protection.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- household microwave ovens, including combination
    microwave ovens (IEC 60335-2-25);<br />\r\n- commercial microwave ovens with a
    cavity door, commercial combination microwave ovens with a cavity door and commercial
    microwave ovens without a cavity door and with transportation means (IEC 60335-2-90);<br
    />\r\n- industrial microwave heating equipment (IEC 60519-6);<br />\r\n- appliances
    for medical purposes (IEC 60601-1);<br />\r\n- appliances and equipment for laboratory
    use (IEC 61010 series);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\nSome of the specifications and tests
    in this standard are not applicable for other than 2 450 MHz appliances.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2013 and Amendment
    1:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 7.1 has been improved in clarity.<br />\r\n- Subclauses 19.11.2
    and 19.103 have been improved in clarity.<br />\r\n- Clause 28 has been modified
    to add screw requirements.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
