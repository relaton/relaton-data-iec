abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-21:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60749-21:2025
    establishes a standard procedure for determining the solderability of device package
    terminations that are intended to be joined to another surface using tin-lead
    (SnPb) or lead-free (Pb-free) solder for the attachment. This test method provides
    a procedure for “dip and look” solderability testing of through hole, axial and
    surface mount devices (SMDs) as well as an optional procedure for a board mounting
    solderability test for SMDs for the purpose of allowing simulation of the soldering
    process to be used in the device application. The test method also provides optional
    conditions for ageing. This test is considered destructive unless otherwise detailed
    in the relevant specification.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 This test method does not assess
    the effect of thermal stresses which can occur during the soldering process. More
    details can be found in IEC 60749‑15 or IEC 60749‑20.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 If a qualitative
    test method is preferred, the Wetting balance test method can be found in IEC
    60068-2-69.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision to certain operating
    conditions in line with current working practices."
