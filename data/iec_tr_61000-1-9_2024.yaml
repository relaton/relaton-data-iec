abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61000-1-9:2024 which is a Technical Report, provides examples for
    the evaluation of measurement uncertainty of harmonic emission tests performed
    using IEC 61000-3-2 and IEC 61000-3-12, and their application to the relevant
    conformity decisions. It also contains practical formulae to enable calculations
    in accordance with ISO/IEC Guide 98-3 (GUM).
