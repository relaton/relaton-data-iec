abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC Guide 41:2003 gives the general recommendations to be taken into
    consideration when determining the most suitable type of packaging to be used
    at the point of sale to protect goods. It is not applicable to packaging solely
    intended to protect goods in bulk when being transported between manufacturers
    and retailers.The objectives of ISO/IEC Guide 41:2003 are to maximize the direct
    and indirect benefits to purchasers of goods and services by: eliminating unnecessary
    packaging so as to reduce the price of goods and the amount of waste; ensuring
    that goods reach consumers in the condition intended by the manufacturer; protecting
    consumers from any potentially harmful effects of the packaging or its contents;
    enabling consumers to store the goods and their packaging appropriately and to
    keep, dispose of, or recycle them, in a manner that minimizes their environmental
    impact.'
