  content: "IEC 62037-1:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62037-1:2025
    deals with the general requirements and measuring methods for intermodulation
    (IM) level measurement of passive RF and microwave components, which can be caused
    by the presence of two or more transmitting signals. The test procedures given
    in this document give the general requirements and measurement methods required
    to characterize the level of unwanted IM signals using two transmitting signals.
    The IEC 62037 series addresses the measurement of PIM but does not cover the long-term
    reliability of a product with reference to its performance. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added clarification
    that PIM generation is typically frequency dependent and noted that testing with
    swept or multiple fixed frequencies often provides more accurate results;<br />\r\nb)
    identified multi-port PIM analyzers as a possible test set-up topography;<br />\r\nc)
    added specification that test power level does not exceed the power handling capability
    of the DUT;<br />\r\nd) updated test specification to include missing parameters
    needed to properly define a PIM test;<br />\r\ne) added clarification that PIM
    test reports include the maximum PIM value measured over the test duration;<br
    />\r\nf) corrected error in Figure 3 that was erroneously changed in IEC 62037-1:2021."
