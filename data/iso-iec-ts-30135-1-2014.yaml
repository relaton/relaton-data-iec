  content: "<p>The EPUB® specification is a distribution and interchange format standard
    for digital publications and documents. EPUB defines a means of representing,
    packaging and encoding structured and semantically enhanced Web content — including
    HTML5, CSS, SVG, images, and other resources — for distribution in a single-file
    format.<br /><br />EPUB 3, the third major release of the standard, consists of
    a set of four specifications, each defining an important component of an overall
    EPUB Publication:<br /><br />-EPUB Publications 3.0 [Publications30], which defines
    publication-level semantics and overarching conformance requirements for EPUB
    Publications.<br /><br />-EPUB Content Documents 3.0 [ContentDocs30], which defines
    profiles of XHTML, SVG and CSS for use in the context of EPUB Publications.<br
    /><br />-EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0 [OCF3], which defines a file format
    and processing model for encapsulating a set of related resources into a single-file
    (ZIP) EPUB Container.<br /><br />-EPUB Media Overlays 3.0 [MediaOverlays30], which
    defines a format and a processing model for synchronization of text and audio.<br
    /><br />EPUB has been widely adopted as the format for digital books (eBooks),
    and these new specifications significantly increase the format's capabilities
    in order to better support a wider range of publication requirements, including
    complex layouts, rich media and interactivity, and global typography features.
    The expectation is that EPUB 3 will be utilized for a broad range of content,
    including books, magazines<br />and educational, professional and scientific publications.<br
    /><br />This document provides a starting point for content authors and software
    developers wishing to<br />understand these specifications. It consists of non-normative
    overview material, including a roadmap to<br />the four building-block specification
    documents that compose EPUB 3.<br /><br />Another non-normative document, EPUB
    3 Changes from EPUB 2.0.1 [EPUB3Changes], describes<br />changes in EPUB 3 from
    the previous version, but is intended primarily for Authors and EPUB Reading<br
    />System vendors migrating from EPUB 2.0.1 to EPUB 3 and for those who anticipate
    supporting both versions.</p>"
