  content: "The proposed project is a revision of ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-2:2018, Systems
    and software engineering — Life cycle management — Part 2: Guidelines for the
    application of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (System life cycle processes). There are no
    scope changes. \nISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-2 is a guideline for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288. It addresses system, life cycle, organizational, project, and process,
    concept application, principally through reference to ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1 and
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. It gives guidance on applying ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 from the
    aspects of strategy, planning, application in organizations, and application on
    projects. It also provides comparison of the differences between ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 current revision and the prior version, ISO/IEC 15288:2015."
