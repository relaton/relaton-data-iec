abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines the mapping functions in exchanges
    of private integrated services networks (PISN)</p><p>required for their attachment
    to Virtual Private Network (VPN) functionality of public (or third party provided)
    network</p><p>equipment.</p><p>Mapping functions are required to provide for the
    physical termination of the interface at the C or T reference points, and for</p><p>the
    mapping of user channels and signalling information flows at the Q reference point
    to the appropriate channels or timeslots</p><p>at the C or T reference point.</p><p>At
    the T reference, point it is assumed that the protocol used on the D channel is
    the enhanced version of DSS1. These protocol</p><p>enhancements are given in Annex
    Q and Annex X of Recommendations Q.931 and Q.932 respectively.</p><p>The mapping
    function specified in this International Standard are applicable to PINXs connected
    to a VPN that supports either</p><p>PISN information flows between accesses and/or
    PISN services.</p><p>The C and Q reference points are defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    The T reference point is defined in ITU-T</p><p>Rec. I.411.</p><p>The types of
    interfaces at the C or T reference point covered by this International Standard
    are the ISDN primary rate interface</p><p>and the basic access interface.</p>"
