abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 98-6:2021 provides guidance on developing and using a measurement
    model and also covers the assessment of the adequacy of a measurement model. The
    document is of particular interest to developers of measurement procedures, working
    instructions and documentary standards. The model describes the relationship between
    the output quantity (the measurand) and the input quantities known to be involved
    in the measurement. The model is used to obtain a value for the measurand and
    an associated uncertainty. Measurement models are also used in, for example, design
    studies, simulation of processes, and in engineering, research and development.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis document explains how to accommodate in a measurement model the
    quantities involved. These quantities relate i) to the phenomenon or phenomena
    on which the measurement is based, that is, the measurement principle, ii) to
    effects arising in the specific measurement, and iii) to the interaction with
    the artefact or sample subject to measurement.<br /><br />\r\nThe guidance provided
    is organized in accordance with a work flow that could be contemplated when developing
    a measurement model from the beginning. This work flow starts with the specification
    of the measurand (Clause 6). Then the measurement principle is modelled (Clause
    7) and an appropriate form of the model is chosen (Clause 8). The basic model
    thus obtained is extended by identifying (Clause 9) and adding (Clause 10) effects
    arising from the measurement and the artefact or sample subject to measurement.
    Guidance on assessing the adequacy of the resulting measurement model is given
    in Clause 12. The distinction between the basic model and the (complete) measurement
    model in the work flow should be helpful to those readers who already have a substantial
    part of the measurement model in place, but would like to verify that it contains
    all effects arising from the measurement so that it is fit for purpose.<br /><br
    />\r\nGuidance on the assignment of probability distributions to the quantities
    appearing in the measurement model is given in JCGM 100:2008 and JCGM 101:2008.
    In Clause 11, this guidance is supplemented by describing how statistical models
    can be developed and used for this purpose.<br /><br />\r\nWhen using a measurement
    model, numerical problems can arise including computational effects such as rounding
    and numerical overflow. It is demonstrated how such problems can often be alleviated
    by expressing a model differently so that it performs well in calculations. It
    is also shown how a reformulation of the model can sometimes be used to eliminate
    some correlation effects among the input quantities when such dependencies exist.<br
    /><br />\r\nExamples from a number of metrology disciplines illustrate the guidance
    provided in this document."
