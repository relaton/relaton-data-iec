abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on developing and using a measurement
    model and also covers the assessment of the adequacy of a measurement model. The
    document is of particular interest to developers of measurement procedures, working
    instructions and documentary standards. The model describes the relationship between
    the output quantity (the measurand) and the input quantities known to be involved
    in the measurement. The model is used to obtain a value for the measurand and
    an associated uncertainty. Measurement models are also used in, for example, design
    studies, simulation of processes, and in</p><p>engineering, research and development.</p><p>This
    document explains how to accommodate in a measurement model the quantities involved.
    These quantities relate i) to the phenomenon or phenomena on which the measurement
    is based, that is, the measurement principle, ii) to effects arising in the specific
    measurement, and iii) to the interaction with the artefact or sample subject to
    measurement.</p><p>The guidance provided is organised in accordance with a work
    flow that could be contemplated when developing a measurement model from the beginning.
    This work flow starts with the specification of the measurand (clause 6). Then
    the measurement principle is modelled (clause 7) and an appropriate form of the
    model is chosen (clause 8). The basic model thus obtained is extended by identifying
    (clause 9) and adding (clause 10) effects arising from the measurement and the
    artefact or sample subject to measurement. Guidance on assessing the adequacy
    of the resulting measurement model is given in clause 12. The distinction between
    the basic model and the (complete) measurement model in the work flow should be
    helpful to those readers who already have a substantial part of the measurement
    model in place, but would like to verify that it contains all effects arising
    from the measurement so that it is fit for purpose.</p><p>Guidance on the assignment
    of probability distributions to the quantities appearing in the measurement model
    is given in JCGM 100:2008 and JCGM 101:2008. In clause 11, this guidance is supplemented
    by describing how statistical models can be developed and used for this purpose.</p><p>When
    using a measurement model, numerical problems can arise including computational
    effects such as rounding and numerical overflow. It is demonstrated how such problems
    can often be alleviated by expressing a model differently so that it performs
    well in calculations. It is also shown how a reformulation of the model can sometimes
    be used to eliminate some correlation effects among the input quantities when
    such dependencies exist.</p><p>Examples from a number of metrology disciplines
    illustrate the guidance provided in this document.</p>"
