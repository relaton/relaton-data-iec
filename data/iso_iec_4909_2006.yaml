abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 4909:2006 establishes specifications for financial transaction
    cards using track 3 and is intended to permit interchange based on the use of
    magnetic stripe encoded information. It specifies the data content and physical
    location of read/write information on track 3 and is to be used in conjunction
    with the relevant parts of ISO/IEC 7811 and ISO/IEC 7812.   ISO/IEC 4909:2006
    recognizes the need for formats of track 3 which can be used independently of,
    or in conjunction with, track 2 as defined in ISO/IEC 7813. This approach is intended
    to permit the greatest degree of flexibility within the financial community in
    facilitating international interchange.   Using track 3 in conjunction with track
    2 is a mode of operation in both on-line and off-line interchange environments.
    This mode of operation requires that the original encoded data on track 2 be read;
    the data on track 3 be read; and, if update is required, all the data on track
    3 be rewritten.   Independent use of track 3 is an alternative mode of operation
    permitting both on-line interchange and off-line interchange based on mutual agreement
    between interested parties. It requires reading only of the data on track 3 and,
    if update is required, the rewriting of all the data on track 3.
