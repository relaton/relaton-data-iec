  content: IEC TR 61850-7-500:2017(E) describes the use of the information model for
    devices and functions of IEC 61850 in applications in substation automation systems,
    but it may also be used as informative input for the modeling of any other application
    domain. In particular, it describes the use of compatible logical node names and
    data objects names for communication between Intelligent Electronic Devices (IED)
    for use cases. This includes the relationship between Logical Nodes and Data Objects
    for the given use cases. If needed for the understanding of the use cases, the
    application of services is also described informatively. If different options
    cannot be excluded they are also mentioned.
