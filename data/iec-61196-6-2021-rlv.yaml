  content: "IEC 61196-6:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61196-6:2021
    applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies the requirements for CATV
    drop cables for analogue and digital one and two way signal transmission, e.g.
    for cable networks for television signals, sound signals, interactive services,
    surveillance & control systems, and satellite television receiving systems according
    to the requirements of IEC 60728-1, IEC 60728-1-1, IEC 60728-101, IEC 60728-10,
    ISO/IEC 11801-1 and ISO/IEC 11801-4. This also includes the transmission of BCT
    signals provided by a CATV, MATV or SMATV cable network. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    extended scope,<br />\r\n- revised sheath marking and labelling."
