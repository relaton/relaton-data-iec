  content: "IEC TS 60079-39:2015(E) specifies the construction, testing, installation
    and maintenance of Power-i apparatus and systems which utilise electronically
    controlled spark duration limitation to maintain an adequate level of intrinsic
    safety. This Technical Specification contains requirements for intrinsically safe
    apparatus and wiring intended for use in explosive atmospheres and for associated
    apparatus intended for connection to intrinsically safe circuits entering such
    atmospheres. This Technical Specification excludes the level of protection \"ia\"
    and the use of software-controlled circuits. This Technical Specification applies
    to electrical equipment utilising voltages not higher than 40 V d.c. and a safety
    factor 1,5 for Groups IIB, IIA, I and III. It is also applicable to Group IIC
    \"ic\" apparatus with a safety factor 1,0. Group IIC \"ib\" apparatus with a safety
    factor 1,5 are restricted to voltages up to 32 V d.c. This type of protection
    is applicable to electrical equipment in which the electrical circuits themselves
    are incapable of causing an explosion of the surrounding explosive atmospheres.
    This Technical Specification is applicable to intrinsically safe apparatus and
    systems which utilise electronically controlled spark duration limitation with
    the aim of providing more electrical power while maintaining an adequate level
    of safety. This Technical Specification is also applicable to electrical equipment
    or parts of electrical equipment located outside hazardous areas or protected
    by another type of protection listed in the IEC 60079 series, where the intrinsic
    safety of the electrical circuits in explosive atmospheres depends on the design
    and construction of such electrical equipment or parts of such electrical equipment.
    The electrical circuits located in the hazardous area are evaluated for use in
    such locations by applying this Technical Specification. This Technical Specification
    supplements and modifies the requirements of IEC 60079-0, IEC 60079-11, IEC 60079-14,
    IEC 60079-17 and IEC 60079-25. Keywords: Power-i apparatus, intrinsically safe
    apparatus and wiring intended for use in explosive atmospheres<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of October 2020 have been included in this copy."
