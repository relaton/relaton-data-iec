abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-6:2010+A1:2012(E) referes to IEC 61156-1. The cables described
    herein are intended primarily for work area wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801
    and ISO/IEC 24702. It covers individually screened, common screened and unscreened
    pairs or quads. The transmission characteristics and the frequency range of the
    cables are specified at 20 Â°C. These cables can be used for various communication
    channels which use as many as four pairs simultaneously. In this sense, this sectional
    specification provides the cable characteristics required by system developers
    to evaluate new systems. It cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2007 and constitutes a technical revision. It includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- new requirements
    for new cables Cat6A, Cat7A;<br />\r\n- revised requirements and tests for the
    cables.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication shall be read in conjunction with IEC
    61156-1:2009.<strong>This consolidated version consists of the third edition (2010)
    and its amendment 1 (2012). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong>"
