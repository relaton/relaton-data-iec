    <p>This International Standard defines a Multimedia Content Description Interface, specifying a series of interfaces</p>
    <p>from system to application level to allow disparate systems to interchange information about multimedia content. It</p>
    <p>describes the architecture for systems, a language for extensions and specific applications, description tools in the</p>
    <p>audio and visual domains, as well as tools that are not specific to audio-visual domains. As a whole, this</p>
    <p>International Standard encompassing all of the aforementioned components is known as "MPEG-7." MPEG-7 is</p>
    <p>divided into eight parts (as defined in the Foreword).</p>
    <p>This part of the MPEG-7 Standard (Part 4: Audio) specifies description tools that pertain to multimedia in the audio</p>
    <p>domain. See below for further details of application.</p>
    <p>This part of the MPEG-7 Standard is intended to be implemented in conjunction with other parts of the standard. In</p>
    <p>particular, MPEG-7 Part 4: Audio assumes knowledge of Part 2: Description Definition Language (DDL) in its</p>
    <p>normative syntactic definitions of Descriptors and Description Schemes. This part of the standard also has</p>
    <p>dependencies upon clauses in Part 5: Multimedia Description Schemes, namely many of the fundamental</p>
    <p>Description Schemes that extend the basic type capabilities of the DDL.</p>
    <p>MPEG-7 is an extensible standard. The method to extend the standard beyond the Description Schemes provided</p>
    <p>in the standard is to define new ones in the DDL, and to make those DSs available with the instantiated</p>
    <p>descriptions. Further details are available in Part 2. To avoid duplicate functionality with other parts of the standard,</p>
    <p>the DDL is the only extension facility provided.</p>
