  content: IEC TR 60865-2:2015(E) shows the application of procedures for the calculation
    of mechanical and thermal effects due to short circuits as presented in IEC 60865-1.
    Thus, this technical report is an addition to IEC 60865-1. It does not, however,
    change the basis for standardized procedures given in that publication. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1994 and constitutes
    a technical revision. It includes the following changes. The determinations for
    auto reclosure together with rigid conductors have been revised. The configurations
    in cases of flexible conductor arrangements have been changed. The influence of
    mid-span droppers to the span has been included. For vertical cable-connection
    the displacement and the tensile force onto the lower fixing point may be calculated
    now. Additional recommendations for foundation loads due to tensile forces have
    been added. The subclause for determination of the thermal equivalent short-circuits
    current has been deleted (is part of IEC 60909-0:2001 now). The standard IEC 60865-1:2011
    has been reorganized and some of the symbols have been changed to follow the conceptual
    characteristic of international standards.
