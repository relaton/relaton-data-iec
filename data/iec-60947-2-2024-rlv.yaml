  content: "IEC 60947-2:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60947-2:2024
    applies to circuit-breakers, intended to be installed and operated by instructed
    or skilled persons, the main contacts of which are intended to be connected to
    circuits, the rated voltage of which does not exceed 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC;
    it also contains additional requirements for integrally fused circuit-breakers.<br
    />\r\nThis document also applies to circuit-breakers with ratings at or below
    1 000 V AC, additionally having one or more ratings above 1 000 V AC but not exceeding
    1 500 V AC.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition
    published in 2016 and its Amendment 1: 2019. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) suitability for isolation (see
    Clause 1);<br />\r\nb) removal of the classification according to the interrupting
    medium, according to the design, according to the suitability for isolation (see
    Clause 4);<br />\r\nc) adjustment of current settings with an external device
    connectable to the release (see 5.7.3);<br />\r\nd) requirements for circuits
    with protective separation (see 8.2.3.8);<br />\r\ne) additional tests for ground-fault
    overcurrent releases (see 9.3.4.2.5);<br />\r\nf) additional tests concerning
    dielectric properties in tripped position (see 9.3.4.3);<br />\r\ng) use of DC
    voltage for dielectric tests (see 9.3.4.6.2 and 9.4.6);<br />\r\nh) tests of individual
    pole breaking capacity under phase-to-neutral AC voltage (see 9.3.11);<br />\r\ni)
    improvement of measurement of power loss in Annex G;<br />\r\nj) changes in EMC
    tests (see Annex J);<br />\r\nk) introduction of CBI class W in Annex L."
