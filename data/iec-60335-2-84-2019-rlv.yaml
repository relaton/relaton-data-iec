  content: "IEC 60335-2-84:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-84:2019
    deals with the safety of electric toilet appliances having a rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V, in which excrement is stored, dried or destructed or which
    wash or dry parts of the human body. Examples of such electric toilets are the
    following and they can be used to process garbage such as paper and food waste.<br
    />\r\n- mouldering toilets;<br />\r\n- package toilets;<br />\r\n- freezing toilets;<br
    />\r\n- vacuum toilets.<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to electric equipment
    for use with conventional toilets.<br />\r\nExamples of such electric equipment
    are<br />\r\n- automatic seat covering devices;<br />\r\n- hopping units;<br />\r\n-
    heated seats;<br />\r\n- pumping units;<br />\r\n- water heaters for spray seats;<br
    />\r\n- spray seats.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account young
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n-
    chemical toilets;<br />\r\n- toilets in which excrement is destructed by combustion.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2013. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- definitions have been renumbered
    (Clause 3);<br />\r\n- requirements for installation instructions have been updated
    to reflect the option in 7.101 of the label being placed on the appliance (7.12.1);<br
    />\r\n- some notes have been converted to normative text (7.101, 22.103, 27.1,
    31);<br />\r\n- requirements have been added for appliances that have programmable
    electronic circuits that limit the number of heating elements and motors from
    being energized at the same time (22.105, Annex R). This part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was
    established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
