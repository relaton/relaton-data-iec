abstract:
- content: "This Recommendation International Standard specifies an alternate block-coding
    algorithm that can be used in place of the block-coding algorithm specified in
    Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1. This alternate block-coding algorithm offers
    a significant increase in throughput at the expense of slightly reduced coding
    efficiency, while a) allowing mathematically lossless transcoding to and from
    codestreams that use the block-coding algorithm specified in Rec. ITUâ€‘T T.800
    | ISO/IEC 15444-1, and b) preserving codestream syntax and features specified
    in Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1.<br />\r\nRecommendation ITU-T T.814 (2019)
    is a common text with ISO/IEC 15444-15:2019, both in their first edition."
