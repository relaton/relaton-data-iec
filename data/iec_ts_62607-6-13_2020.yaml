abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-13:2020 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic<br />\r\n• oxygen functional group content<br
    />\r\non graphite oxide, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and other types
    of functionalized graphene by<br />\r\n• Boehm titration method.<br />\r\nIn this
    document, the measured functional groups are carboxyl groups (also in the form
    of their cyclic anhydrides), lactone groups, hydroxyl groups and reactive carbonyl
    groups. Oxygen functional groups that exhibit no reactivity such as epoxides cannot
    be measured<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum 1 of October 2020 have been
