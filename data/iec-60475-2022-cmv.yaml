  content: "IEC 60475:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60475:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60475:2011
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 10 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60475:2022 is applicable to the sampling procedure used for
    insulating liquids in delivery containers and in electrical equipment such as
    power and instrument transformers, reactors, bushings, oil-filled cables, oil-filled
    tank-type capacitors, switchgear and load tap changers (LTCs). This document applies
    to liquids the viscosity of which at the sampling temperature is less than 1 500
    mm2/s (or cSt). It applies to mineral oils and non-mineral oils (such as synthetic
    esters, natural esters, vegetable oils or silicones)."
