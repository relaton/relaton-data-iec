abstract:
- content: "IEC 62803-2:2024 provides the measurement method of the common-mode rejection
    ratio of optical coherent detection devices in high-speed RoF systems, as well
    as in high-speed optical signal transmission systems. In addition, the method
    is also effective for the estimation of the detailed frequency response of the
    common-mode rejection ratios and O/E conversion efficiency. The method applies
    for the following:<br />\r\n- frequency range: 1 GHz to 110 GHz;<br />\r\n- wavelength
    band: 0,8 µm to 2,0 µm.<br />\r\nThe use of optical coherent detection devices
    for high-speed RoF system is shown in Annex A as an example."
