abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard is a part of the functional requirements
    for the Private Integrated Services Network (PISN)</p><p>and defines the functions
    and procedures that are required by Private Integrated Services Network exchanges
    (PINXs)</p><p>and the intervening network (IVN) in order to establish Inter-PINX
    Connections (IPC). The IPC is used for the transfer</p><p>of signalling and user
    information between PINXs.</p><p>The Private Signalling System No.1 (PSS1) as
    defined in ISO/IEC 11572 and 11574 defines the signalling procedures</p><p>and
    protocol for call control between PINXs at the Q reference point. These procedures
    are independent of the types of</p><p>IVNs, called scenarios used to interconnect
    the PINXs. ISO/IEC TR14475 describes the use of various types of IVNs</p><p>which
    provide the interconnections of PINXs.</p><p>In order to connect a PINX to another
    PINX, mapping functions are required to adapt the specific interfaces at the C</p><p>reference
    point to the application at the Q reference point. As such, mapping functions
    provide for physical adaptation</p><p>to the interface at the C reference point.
    Mapping functions also provide for the mapping of user channels and</p><p>signalling
    information at the Q reference point to the appropriate channels or time-slots
    at the C reference point. The C</p><p>and Q reference points are defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.</p><p>The types of interfaces at the C reference point covered by this
    International Standard are:</p><p>[1] 1544 kbit/s unstructured digital leased
    line</p><p>[2] 1544 kbit/s structured digital leased line</p><p>[3] 2048 kbit/s
    unstructured digital leased line</p><p>[4] 2048 kbit/s structured digital leased
    line</p><p>[5] 64 kbit/s unrestricted digital leased line</p><p>[6] 1544 kbit/s
    ISDN Primary Rate user-network layer 1 interface</p><p>[7] 2048 kbit/s ISDN Primary
    Rate user-network layer 1 interface</p><p>[8] ISDN Basic Rate user-network layer
    1 interface</p><p>At the Q reference point the mappings provide a 64 kbit/s service
    for user channels and a packet mode service for the</p><p>signalling channel.
    The applied mapping is a static mapping, i.e. there is a fixed relationship between
    user and</p><p>signalling channels at the Q reference point and the timeslots
    of the interface at the C reference point. Any changes are</p><p>subject to administrative
    actions.</p><p>This International Standard specifies PINX mapping functions between
    the Q reference point and the C reference point</p><p>for IVNs which provide either
    dedicated or semi-permanent, non-user activation, circuit-mode IPCs. The dedicated
    IPC</p><p>is the connection permanently established, usually for the duration
    of a contractual period. The semi-permanent IPC is</p><p>the connection whose
    resources are reserved for specified times during a contractual period. The semi-permanent
    IPC is</p><p>established by management control with or without user activations.
    In this International Standard, the semi-permanent</p><p>IPC established by management
    control with user activation is outside the scope.</p><p>The IVN can be a dedicated
    physical link, dedicated transmission system or a cross connect system, or semi-permanent</p><p>connection
    system. IVNs which include inverse mulitlexer techniques (e.g. channel aggregation
    in accordance with</p><p>ISO/IEC 13871) are covered by this International Standard
    so far as they support one of the interfaces listed above.</p><p>This International
    Standard also specifies mapping information. At both sides of the PINX, mapping
    information is</p><p>required to administer the scenarios.</p><p>This International
    Standard is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a Private
    Integrated Services</p><p>Network (PISN) and which support signalling protocols
    at the Q reference point.</p>"
