- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard is a part of the functional requirements for the Private
    Integrated Services Network (PISN) and defines the functions and procedures that
    are required by Private Integrated Services Network exchanges (PINXs) and the
    intervening network (IVN) in order to establish Inter-PINX Connections (IPC).
    The IPC is used for the transfer of signalling and user information between PINXs.<br
    />\r\nThe Private Signalling System No.1 (PSS1) as defined in ISO/IEC 11572 and
    11574 defines the signalling procedures and protocol for call control between
    PINXs at the Q reference point. These procedures are independent of the types
    of IVNs, called scenarios used to interconnect the PINXs. ISO/IEC TR14475 describes
    the use of various types of IVNs which provide the interconnections of PINXs.<br
    />\r\nIn order to connect a PINX to another PINX, mapping functions are required
    to adapt the specific interfaces at the C reference point to the application at
    the Q reference point. As such, mapping functions provide for physical adaptation
    to the interface at the C reference point. Mapping functions also provide for
    the mapping of user channels and signalling information at the Q reference point
    to the appropriate channels or time-slots at the C reference point. The C and
    Q reference points are defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nThe types of interfaces
    at the C reference point covered by this International Standard are:<br />\r\n[1]
    1544 kbit/s unstructured digital leased line<br />\r\n[2] 1544 kbit/s structured
    digital leased line<br />\r\n[3] 2048 kbit/s unstructured digital leased line<br
    />\r\n[4] 2048 kbit/s structured digital leased line<br />\r\n[5] 64 kbit/s unrestricted
    digital leased line<br />\r\n[6] 1544 kbit/s ISDN Primary Rate user-network layer
    1 interface<br />\r\n[7] 2048 kbit/s ISDN Primary Rate user-network layer 1 interface<br
    />\r\n[8] ISDN Basic Rate user-network layer 1 interface<br />\r\nAt the Q reference
    point the mappings provide a 64 kbit/s service for user channels and a packet
    mode service for the signalling channel. The applied mapping is a static mapping,
    i.e. there is a fixed relationship between user and signalling channels at the
    Q reference point and the timeslots of the interface at the C reference point.
    Any changes are subject to administrative actions.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard specifies PINX mapping functions between the Q reference point and the
    C reference point for IVNs which provide either dedicated or semi-permanent, non-user
    activation, circuit-mode IPCs. The dedicated IPC is the connection permanently
    established, usually for the duration of a contractual period. The semi-permanent
    IPC is the connection whose resources are reserved for specified times during
    a contractual period. The semi-permanent IPC is established by management control
    with or without user activations. In this International Standard, the semi-permanent
    IPC established by management control with user activation is outside the scope.<br
    />\r\nThe IVN can be a dedicated physical link, dedicated transmission system
    or a cross connect system, or semi-permanent connection system. IVNs which include
    inverse mulitlexer techniques (e.g. channel aggregation in accordance with ISO/IEC
    13871) are covered by this International Standard so far as they support one of
    the interfaces listed above.<br />\r\nThis International Standard also specifies
    mapping information. At both sides of the PINX, mapping information is required
    to administer the scenarios.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is applicable
    to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN) and which support signalling protocols at the Q reference point."
