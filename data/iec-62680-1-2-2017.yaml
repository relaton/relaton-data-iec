  content: "IEC 62680-1-2:2017(E) defines a power delivery system covering all elements
    of a USB system including: Hosts, Devices, Hubs, Chargers and cable assemblies.
    This specification describes the architecture, protocols, power supply behavior,
    connectors and cabling necessary for managing power delivery over USB at up to
    100 W. This specification is intended to be fully compatible and extend the existing
    USB infrastructure. It is intended that this specification will allow system OEMs,
    power supply and peripheral developers adequate flexibility for product versatility
    and market differentiation without losing backwards compatibility.<br />\r\nUSB
    Power Delivery is designed to operate independently of the existing USB bus defined
    mechanisms used to negotiate power which are:<br />\r\n- [USB 2.0], [USB 3.1]in
    band requests for high power interfaces.<br />\r\n- [USBBC 1.2]mechanisms for
    supplying higher power (not mandated by this specification).<br />\r\n- [USB Type-C
    1.2]mechanisms for supplying higher power"
