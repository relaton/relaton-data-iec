abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data
    content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to human-readable
    features (ISO/IEC 18013-1), machine-readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013â€‘2), and
    access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3). It
    creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL
    without impeding individual countries/states to apply their privacy rules and
    national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their
    specific needs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-3:2009</p><ul><li>is based on the machine-readable
    data content specified in ISO/IEC 18013-2;</li><li>specifies mechanisms and rules
    available to issuing authorities (IAs) for<ul><li>access control (i.e. limiting
    access to the machine-readable data recorded on the IDL),</li><li>document authentication
    (i.e. confirming that the document was issued by the claimed IA),</li><li>data
    integrity validation (i.e. confirming that the data has not been changed since
    issuing).</li></ul></li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 18013-3:2009 does not address issues related
    to the subsequent use of data obtained from the IDL, e.g. privacy issues.</p>"
