  content: "IEC 60695-2-13:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60695-2-13:2021
    specifies the details of the glow-wire test to be applied to test specimens of
    solid electrical insulating materials or other solid materials for ignitability
    testing to determine the glow-wire ignition temperature (GWIT). The GWIT is the
    temperature which is 25 K (or 30 K) higher than the maximum test temperature,
    determined during this standardized procedure, at which the tested material does
    not ignite, or sustained flaming combustion does not occur for a time longer than
    5 s for any single flame event and the specimen is not totally consumed. This
    test is a materials test carried out on a series of standard test specimens. The
    data obtained, along with data from the glow-wire flammability index (GWFI) test
    method for materials, IEC 60695-2-12, can then be used in a preselection process
    in accordance with IEC 60695-1-30 [4] to judge the ability of materials to meet
    the requirements of IEC 60695-2-11. This basic safety publication focusing on
    safety test method(s) is primarily intended for use by technical committees in
    the preparation of safety publications in accordance with the principles laid
    down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. One of the responsibilities of a technical
    committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety publications in
    the preparation of its publications. This publication is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 60695-2-10. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2010 and Amendment 1:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- New terms and definitions with regards to
    times and durations have been added to Clause 3, with an effect on the application
    of the test method."
