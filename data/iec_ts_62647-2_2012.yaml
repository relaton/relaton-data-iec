abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62647-2:2012(E) establishes processes for documenting the mitigating
    steps taken to reduce the harmful effects of Pb-free tin in electronic systems.
    This Technical Specification is applicable to aerospace, defence, and high performance
    (ADHP) electronic applications which procure equipment that may contain Pb-free
    tin finishes. It may be used by other high-performance and high-reliability industries,
    at their discretion.
