    IEC 61360 for the creation of computer processable product libraries, catalogues
    and reference dictionaries. This description will provide the details of the products
    and their properties in an unambiguous manner, capable of computer communication
    in a form that is independent of any proprietary application software. The term
    “product” is taken to include devices, processes, systems, installations, etc.
