abstract:
- content: It provides user programs with a means to access the fieldbus communication
    environment. In this respect, the FAL can be viewed as a "window between corresponding
    application programs." This standard provides common elements for basic time-critical
    and non-time-critical messaging communications between application programs in
    an automation environment and material specific to Type 2 fieldbus. The term "time-critical"
    is used to represent the presence of a time-window, within which one or more specified
    actions are required to be completed with some defined level of certainty. Failure
    to complete specified actions within the time window risks failure of the applications
    requesting the actions, with attendant risk to equipment, plant and possibly human
    life. It includes the following significant changes from the previous edition
    deletion of the former Type 6 fieldbus for lack of market relevance; addition
    of new types of fieldbuses; partition of part 6 of the third edition into multiple
    parts numbered.
