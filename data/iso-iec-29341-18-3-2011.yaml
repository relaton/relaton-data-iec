  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-18-3:2011(E) includes the device definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred
    to herein as RAServer Device. The RAServer Device is a UPnP Device UPnP device
    that allows control points to configure Remote Access Servers. This Device provides
    control points with the following functionality:<br/>                             \n-
    Determine if the Remote Access Server is reachable from the public Internet;<br/>
    \                                                    \n- Enable a Remote Access
    Server to be reachable from the public Internet;<br/>                                                     \n-
    Enumerate the Remote Access Transport mechanisms supported by the Remote Access
    Server;<br/>                                        \n- Enumerate the Credentials
    Delivery mechanisms supported by the Remote Access Server;<br/>                                        \n-
    Configure active Remote Access Transport profiles;<br/>         \n- Configure
    filters for allowing which local Devices are visible in remote networks;<br/>
    \                                             \n- Configure filters for allowing
    which remote Devices are visible in the local network;<br/>                                            \n-
    Maintains list of registered remote users, and authenticates when they log in
    depending on their pre-configured info appropriately."
