    edition:<br />\r\na) Added new improved approach for exposing structure definitions.
    An Attribute on the DataType Node now simply contains a binary description.<br
    />\r\nb) Added new flags for Variables to indicate atomicity when reading or writing.<br
    />\r\nc) Added Roles and Permissions to allow configuration of a role-based authorization.<br
    />\r\nd) Added new data types: “Union”, “Decimal”, “OptionSet”, “DateString”,
    “TimeString”, “DurationString”, NormalizedString”, “DecimalString”, and “AudioDataType”.<br
    />\r\ne) Added definition on how to use the ModellingRules OptionalPlaceHolder
