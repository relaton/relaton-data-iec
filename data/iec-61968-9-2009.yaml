  content: "IEC 61968-9:2009(E) specifies the information content of a set of message
    types that can be used to support many of the business functions related to meter
    reading and control. Typical uses of the message types include meter reading,
    meter control, meter events, customer data synchronization and customer switching.
    Although intended primarily for electrical distribution networks, IEC 61968-9
    can be used for other metering applications, including non-electrical metered
    quantities necessary to support gas and water networks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid."
