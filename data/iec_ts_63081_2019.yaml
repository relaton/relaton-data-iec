abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63081:2019:<br />\r\n• defines key quantities relevant to ultrasonic
    materials characterization;<br />\r\n• specifies methods for direct measurement
    of many key ultrasonic materials parameters.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to all measurements of properties of passive acoustic materials under drive conditions
    that are not subject to nonlinear acoustic propagation. Whilst there are materials
    properties that may be of interest in a nonlinear drive regime, these are currently
    outside the scope of this document."
