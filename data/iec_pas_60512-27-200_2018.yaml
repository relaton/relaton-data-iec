abstract:
- content: "IEC/PAS 60512-27-200:2018 covers additional, supplemental specifications
    for signal integrity and transmission performance test methods of IEC 60512-27-100,
    for connectors using de-embedded crosstalk measurements, which are specified in
    respective parts of IEC 60603-7 standards for connecting hardware applications
    up to 2 000 MHz.<br />\r\nThese additional specifications are also applicable
    for testing the related lower frequency connectors. However, the test methodology
    specified in the detail specification for any given connector remains the reference
    conformance test for that connector.<br />\r\nTest procedures of IEC 60512-27-100
    affected by these supplemental methods and procedures are:<br />\r\n• insertion
    loss, test 27a;<br />\r\n• return loss, test 27b;<br />\r\n• near-end crosstalk
    (NEXT) test 27c;<br />\r\n• far-end crosstalk (FEXT), test 27d;<br />\r\n• transverse
    conversion loss (TCL), test 27f;<br />\r\n• transverse conversion transfer loss
    (TCTL), test 27g.<br />\r\nOther test procedures referenced here are:<br /><em>•
    transfer impedance (ZT), see test procedures in IEC 62153-4-6 or IEC 62153-4-7.</em><br
    /><em>• for coupling attenuation (aC), see test procedures in IEC 62153-4-7 or
    IEC 62153-4-12.</em><br />\r\nKeywords: Connector, Signal Integrity"
