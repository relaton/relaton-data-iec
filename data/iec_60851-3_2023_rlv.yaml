    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60851-3: 2023
    specifies the following test methods for winding wires:<br />\r\n- Test 6: Elongation;<br
    />\r\n- Test 7: Springiness;<br />\r\n- Test 8: Flexibility and adherence;<br
    />\r\n- Test 11: Resistance to abrasion;<br />\r\n- Test 18: Heat bonding.<br
    />\r\nFor definitions, general notes on test methods and the complete series of
    test methods for winding wires, IEC 60851-1 applies. This document also provides
    recommended friction test methods in Annex B. This fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2009, Amendment 1:2013 and Amendment 2:2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Clarification of the distance measurement for determining loss of adhesion in
    6.6.3, 6.6.4 for fibre-covered wires and 6.6.5 for tape-wrapped wires."
