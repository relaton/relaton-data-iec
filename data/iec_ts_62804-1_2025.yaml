abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62804-1:2025 defines procedures to evaluate the durability of crystalline
    silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules to the effects of short-term high-voltage stress,
    primarily potential-induced degradation (PID). Three test methods are given. The
    first type, which has two variations, is conducted in the dark and is primarily
    designed for assessing PID-shunting. The second type, which also has two variations,
    incorporates the factor of ultraviolet light and is intended for assessing PID-polarization.
    A separate test for the recovery of PID polarization under ultraviolet light is
    also included.<br />\r\nThe testing in this document is designed for crystalline
    silicon PV modules with silicon cells having passivating dielectric layers, for
    degradation mechanisms involving mobile ions influencing the electric field over
    the silicon semiconductor or electronically interacting with the silicon semiconductor.
    This document is not intended for evaluating modules with thin-film technologies,
    tandem, or heterojunction devices but can be used for guidance. The actual durability
    of modules to system voltage stress depends on the environmental conditions under
    which they are operated and the voltage potential in the module relative to earth
    (ground). These tests are intended to assess PV module sensitivity to PID irrespective
    of actual stresses under operation in different climates and systems."
