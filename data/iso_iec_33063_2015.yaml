abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 33063:2015<br />\r\n- defines a process assessment model that
    meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an
    assessment of process capability using the process measurement framework defined
    in ISO/IEC 33020. The process assessment model provides indicators for guidance
    on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119â€‘2 and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020, and<br />\r\n-
    provides guidance, by example, on the definition, selection, and use of assessment
    indicators.<br />\r\nA process assessment model comprises a set of indicators
    of process performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis
    for collecting the objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings,
    following the requirements of ISO/IEC 33002. The set of indicators included in
    this International Standard is not intended to be an all-inclusive set nor is
    it intended to be applicable in its entirety. Subsets that are appropriate to
    the context and scope of the assessment should be selected.<br />\r\nThe process
    assessment model in this International Standard is directed at assessment sponsors
    and competent assessors who wish to select a model and associated documented process
    method for assessment (for either capability determination or process improvement).<br
    />\r\nAny process assessment model for software testing meeting the requirements
    defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning models for process assessment may be used
    for assessment. Different models and methods might be needed to address differing
    business and testing needs. This assessment model is provided as an exemplar of
    a model meeting all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC 33004."
