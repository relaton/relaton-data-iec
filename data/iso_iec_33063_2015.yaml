abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 33063:2015</p><p>- defines a process assessment model that
    meets the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an
    assessment of process capability using the process measurement framework defined
    in ISO/IEC 33020. The process assessment model provides indicators for guidance
    on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29119‑2 and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020, and</p><p>- provides
    guidance, by example, on the definition, selection, and use of assessment indicators.</p><p>A
    process assessment model comprises a set of indicators of process performance
    and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the
    objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings, following the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 33002. The set of indicators included in this International Standard
    is not intended to be an all-inclusive set nor is it intended to be applicable
    in its entirety. Subsets that are appropriate to the context and scope of the
    assessment should be selected.</p><p>The process assessment model in this International
    Standard is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to
    select a model and associated documented process method for assessment (for either
    capability determination or process improvement).</p><p>Any process assessment
    model for software testing meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning
    models for process assessment may be used for assessment. Different models and
    methods might be needed to address differing business and testing needs. This
    assessment model is provided as an exemplar of a model meeting all the requirements
    expressed in ISO/IEC 33004.</p>"
