abstract:
- content: "IEC 62439-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62439-3:2016 is applicable
    to high-availability automation networks based on the Ethernet technology. This
    part of IEC 62439 specifies two redundancy protocols designed to provide seamless
    recovery in case of single failure of an inter-bridge link or bridge in the network,
    which are based on the same scheme: parallel transmission of duplicated information.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous<br />\r\nedition:<br
    />\r\n- technical corrections and extension of specifications;<br />\r\n- consideration
    of IEC 61588 clock synchronization with end-to-end delay measurement alongside
    the existing peer-to-peer delay measurement in PRP."
