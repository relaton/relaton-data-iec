abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: It provides common elements for basic time-critical messaging communications
    between devices in an automation environment. The term "time-critical" is used
    to represent the presence of a time-window, within which one or more specified
    actions are required to be completed with some defined level of certainty. Failure
    to complete specified actions within the time window risks failure of the applications
    requesting the actions, with attendant risk to equipment, plant and possibly human
    life. It includes the following significant changes with respect to the previous
    edition deletion of the former Type 6 fieldbus, and the placeholder for a Type
    5 fieldbus data-link layer, for lack of market relevance; addition of new types
    of fieldbuses; division of this part into multiple parts numbered.
