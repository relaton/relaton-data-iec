abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-41:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-41:2024
    describes three methods for determining and measuring the modal bandwidth of multimode
    optical fibres (see IEC 60793-2-10, IEC 60793-2-30, and the IEC 60793‑2‑40 series).
    The baseband frequency response is directly measured in the frequency domain by
    determining the fibre response to a sinusoidaly modulated light source. The baseband
    response can also be measured by observing the broadening of a narrow pulse of
    light. The calculated response is determined using differential mode delay (DMD)
    data. The three methods are:<br />\r\nMethod A – Time domain (pulse distortion)
    measurement<br />\r\nMethod B – Frequency-domain measurement<br />\r\nMethod C
    – Overfilled launch modal bandwidth calculated from differential mode delay (OMBc)<br
    />\r\nMethod A and method B can be performed using one of two launches: an overfilled
    launch (OFL) condition or a restricted mode launch (RML) condition. Method C is
    only defined for A1-OM3 to A1-OM5 multimode fibres and uses a weighted summation
    of DMD launch responses with the weights corresponding to an overfilled launch
    condition. The relevant test method and launch condition is chosen according to
    the type of fibre.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 These test methods are commonly used in production
    and research facilities and are not easily accomplished in the field.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 OFL has been used for the modal bandwidth value for LED-based applications for
    many years. However, no single launch condition is representative of the laser
    (e.g. VCSEL) sources that are used for gigabit and higher rate transmission. This
    fact drove the development of IEC 60793-1-49 for determining the effective modal
    bandwidth of laser optimized 50 µm fibres. See IEC 60793-2-10 and IEC 61280-4-1
    for more information.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the addition of a direct reference for method A
    and method B."
