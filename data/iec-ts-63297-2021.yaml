  content: "IEC TS 63297:2021 is an attempt to provide classification of NILM sensing
    devices for use in NILM systems, according to the state of the art of NILM technologies.<br
    />\r\nThe classification of NILM analytics and NILM systems, as well as performance
    indicators for NILM systems, can be considered in the future.<br />\r\nNILM systems
    produce estimated disaggregation into energy usages. When accurate measurement
    and analysis of energy consumption and/or other electrical parameters is needed
    (e.g. for monitoring the electrical installation), systems based on standardized
    measuring devices (e.g. PMD, PQI or meters) are used."
