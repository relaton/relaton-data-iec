abstract:
- content: IEC 61747-40-6:2018(E) is a mechanical performance testing procedure for
    cover glass used in electronic flat panel displays in mobile devices. This document
    focuses on the measurement of surface fracture load after flaw introduction via
    grit particle abrasion. After abrasion, the retained surface fracture load is
    measured with the method documented in IEC 61747-40-4.
