  content: "IEC 60747-15:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60747-15:2024
    gives the requirements for isolated power semiconductor devices. These requirements
    are additional to those given in other parts of IEC 60747 for the corresponding
    non-isolated power devices and parts of IEC 60748 for ICs. This third edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) The intelligent power semiconductor modules (IPM), which
    was previously excluded from the first and second edition, is now included in
    this document (Annex C);<br />\r\nb) The thermal resistance is described for each
    switch (6.2.4);<br />\r\nc) Added isolation test between temperature sensor and
    terminals, in case there is an agreement with the user (6.1.2)."
