abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18026:2009 specifies the Spatial Reference Model (SRM) defining
    relevant aspects of spatial positioning and related information processing. The
    SRM allows precise and unambiguous specification of geometric properties such
    as position (location), direction, and distance. The SRM addresses the needs of
    a broad community of users, who have a range of accuracy and performance requirements
    in computationally intensive applications.</p><p>Aspects of ISO/IEC 18026:2009
    apply to, but are not limited to:</p><ol><li>mapping, charting, geodesy, and imagery;</li><li>topography;</li><li>location-based
    services;</li><li>oceanography;</li><li>meteorology and climatology;</li><li>interplanetary
    and planetary sciences;</li><li>embedded systems; and</li><li>modelling and simulation.</li></ol><p>The
    application program interface supports more than 30 forms of position representation.
    To ensure that spatial operations are performed consistently, the application
    program interface specifies conversion operations with functionality defined to
    ensure high precision transformation between alternative representations of geometric
    properties.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18026:2009 is not intended to replace the standards
    and specifications developed by ISO/TC 211, ISO/TC 184, the International Astronomical
    Union (IAU), and the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). It is applicable
    to applications whose spatial information requirements overlap two or more of
    the application areas that are the scope of the work of ISO/TC 211, ISO/TC 184,
    the IAU, and the IAG.</p>"
