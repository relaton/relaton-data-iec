abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18026:2009 specifies the Spatial Reference Model (SRM) defining relevant aspects
    of spatial positioning and related information processing. The SRM allows precise
    and unambiguous specification of geometric properties such as position (location),
    direction, and distance. The SRM addresses the needs of a broad community of users,
    who have a range of accuracy and performance requirements in computationally intensive
    applications.<br />\r\nAspects of ISO/IEC 18026:2009 apply to, but are not limited
    to:<br />\r\nmapping, charting, geodesy, and imagery;<br />\r\ntopography;<br
    />\r\nlocation-based services;<br />\r\noceanography;<br />\r\nmeteorology and
    climatology;<br />\r\ninterplanetary and planetary sciences;<br />\r\nembedded
    systems; and<br />\r\nmodelling and simulation.<br />\r\nThe application program
    interface supports more than 30 forms of position representation. To ensure that
    spatial operations are performed consistently, the application program interface
    specifies conversion operations with functionality defined to ensure high precision
    transformation between alternative representations of geometric properties.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 18026:2009 is not intended to replace the standards and specifications
    developed by ISO/TC 211, ISO/TC 184, the International Astronomical Union (IAU),
    and the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). It is applicable to applications
    whose spatial information requirements overlap two or more of the application
    areas that are the scope of the work of ISO/TC 211, ISO/TC 184, the IAU, and the
    IAG."
