abstract:
- content: '<p>The purpose of ISO/IEC 23000-6 Professional archival application format
    (PA-AF) is to provide a standardized packaging format for digital files. This
    packaging format can also serve as an implementation of the information package
    specified by the Reference Model of Open Archival Information System (OAIS). The
    OAIS Reference Model is a framework for understanding and applying concepts necessary
    for long-term digital information preservation (where "long-term" is long enough
    to be concerned about changing technologies). In addition, PA-AF can also be used
    as an intermediate or exchange packaging format for any kind of multimedia content.</p><p>PA-AF
    specifies the following: a metadata format to describe the original structure
    of digital files archived in a PA-AF file; a metadata format to describe context
    information related to a PA-AF file and digital files archived in it; a metadata
    format to describe necessary information to reverse the pre-processing processes
    applied to digital files prior to archiving them in a PA-AF file; and a file format
    for carriage of the metadata formats and digital files.</p><p>While a general
    archival process may include processes ranging from creation, delivery to the
    archival system, to dissemination to consumers, PA-AF is limited in scope as follows.
    PA-AF specifies neither how to create input content nor any agreement on how the
    content should be handled and delivered to the archiving process. PA-AF assumes
    that input content for the archiving process is available in an appropriate digital
    format. PA-AF specifies the format of a digital archive produced by the archival
    process. It does not specify how the archive output by the archival process is
    disseminated to end-users.</p><p>Note that the archiving policy and agreements
    are not included in the scope of PA-AF. PA-AF is independent from any kind of
    compression scheme or any kind of metadata format. PA-AF provides a mechanism
    for identifying the pre-processing tools applied to the archived content files.
    Any kind of compression tool or encryption tool can be specified as an external
    pre-processing tool. In addition, though PA-AF optionally provides a predefined
    minimum set of descriptive metadata for its archived contents, any kind of application-
    specific meta-information can be stored in the PA-AF package as a content file
    or files if the archive''s policy or agreements require it. For this purpose,
    PA-AF provides a mechanism for linking that meta-information to the archived content
    file.</p><p>In the second edition, the maximum number of files that can be packed
    in a PA-AF file is extended to more than 65535. The latest reference software
    and conformance bitstreams are also included.</p>'
