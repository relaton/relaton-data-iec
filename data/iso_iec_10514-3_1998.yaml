abstract:
- content: "<p><strong>1.1 Goals</strong></p><p>In addition to the goals of the Base
    Language, the goal of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is to</p><p>provide simple extensions
    to allow object oriented programming facilities to be added to the</p><p>Base
    Language defined in International Standard ISO/IEC 10514-1 without altering the</p><p>meaning
    of any valid program allowed by the Base Language (except for the use of the new</p><p>keywords
    introduced by this standard, see clause 5).</p><p><strong>1.2 Specifications included
    in this part of ISO/IEC 10514</strong></p><p>In addition to the specifications
    included in the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514</p><p>provides specifications
    for:</p><p>— required symbols for Object Oriented Modula-2 programs;</p><p>— the
    lexical structure, the syntactic structure and semantics of Object Oriented Modula-2</p><p>programs;</p><p>—
    the interface to and the semantics of Object Oriented Modula-2 system modules;</p><p>—
    violations of the rules for the use of the object oriented extensions that a conforming</p><p>implementation
    is required to detect;</p><p>— further compliance requirements for implementations,
    including documentation</p><p>requirements.</p><p><strong>1.3 Relationship to
    ISO/IEC 10514-1</strong></p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is part three of the
    multi-part standard ISO/IEC 10514. This part</p><p>of ISO/IEC 10514 extends and
    modifies the Base Language ISO/IEC 10514-1, but the</p><p>adoption of this part
    of ISO/IEC 10514 is optional with respect to the Base Language. This</p><p>part
    of ISO/IEC 10514 is also independent of any other parts of ISO/IEC 10514 except
    for</p><p>part 1, and can be adopted either together with or independently of
    such other parts.</p><p><strong>1.4 Specifications not within the scope of this
    part of ISO/IEC 10514</strong></p><p>In addition to the categories of specifications
    excluded by the Base Language this part of</p><p>ISO/IEC 10514 provides no specifications
    for:</p><p>— the internal representation of the objects and their associated methods;</p><p>—
    the implementation of the garbage collector;</p><p>— the implementation of the
    tracking mechanism for traced objects.</p>"
