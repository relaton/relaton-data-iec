abstract:
- content: IEC 62257-9-6:2008(E) proposes a simple selection procedure and cheap,
    comparative tests which can be performed in laboratories of developing countries,
    in order to identify the most suitable model of small Photovoltaic Individual
    Electrification Systems (PV- IES) up to 500 Wp for a particular rural electrification
    project from a number of products submitted for test. The tests provided in IEC
    62257-9-6 allow assessment of the performance of a PV-IES according to the requirement
    of the general specification of the project (see IEC/TS 62257-2) and to verify
    their ability to provide the required service.
