abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-28-1:2017, Today multi-screen/second-screen solutions are proliferating.
    However, each is a proprietary vertical for particular vendor(s). Therefore users
    expectations aren't being met:<br />\r\n- Seamless interoperability across vendors.<br
    />\r\n- Ability for second screen integrated usages rather than 100s of different
    apps.<br />\r\nThe UPnP Multi-Screen Device Control Protocols (DCPs) provide an
    open interface to enable this interoperability between devices and applications,
    i.e. enable time-sensitive and interactive services, including implementation-specific
    applications, among various display devices.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29341-28-1:2017
    describes the overall Multi-Screen Architecture, which forms the foundation for
    the UPnP Multi-Screen Device and Service templates. The Multi-Screen Architecture
    defines the general interaction between UPnP control points and UPnP devices defined
    by the UPnP Multi-Screen DCPs."
