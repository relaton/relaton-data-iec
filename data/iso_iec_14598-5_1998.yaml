abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 14598 provides requirements and recommendations
    for the practical</p><p>implementation of software product evaluation when several
    parties need to understand, accept and</p><p>trust evaluation results. In particular,
    it may be used to apply the concepts described in</p><p>ISO/IEC 9126.</p><p>The
    process described in this part of ISO/IEC 14598 defines the activities needed
    to analyse</p><p>evaluation requirements, to specify, design and perform evaluation
    actions and to conclude the</p><p>evaluation of any kind of software product.</p><p>The
    evaluation process may be used to evaluate already existing products, provided
    the needed</p><p>product components are available, or to evaluate products in
    development.</p><p>NOTE For the evaluation of a product in development, the evaluation
    process needs to be</p><p>synchronized with the software development process and
    product components are evaluated as they</p><p>are delivered.</p><p>This part
    of ISO/IEC 14598 may be used by</p><p>- testing laboratory evaluators, when providing
    software product evaluation services,</p><p>- software suppliers, when planning
    evaluation of their products, including evaluation to be</p><p>carried out by
    independent testing services,</p><p>- software acquirers, when requesting evaluation
    information from a supplier or testing service,</p><p>- software users when evaluating
    products or when using evaluation reports provided by testing</p><p>laboratories,</p><p>-
    certification bodies in defining new certification schemes for software products.</p>"
