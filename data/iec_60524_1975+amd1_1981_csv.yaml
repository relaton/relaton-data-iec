abstract:
- content: IEC 60524:1975+AMD1:1981 CSV is applicable to d.c. resistive volt ratio
    boxes with fixed ratios having a ratio input voltage up to 1.5 kV and a class
    index of 0.1 or better, as well as to all equipment which is built-in or supplied
    by the manufacturer (or responsible supplier) as an essential part of the volt
    ratio box. Classification system. Permissible errors for each accuracy class.
    Conditions for determination of errors. Markings. Information supplied by the
    manufacturer.<br /><br /><strong>This consolidated version consists of the first
    edition (1975) and its amendment 1 (1981). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.</strong>
