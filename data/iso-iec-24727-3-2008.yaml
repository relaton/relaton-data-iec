    <p>ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between integrated circuit cards (ICCs) and external applications to include generic services for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to ISO/IEC 7816-4.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727 is relevant to ICC applications desiring interoperability among diverse application domains.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 defines services as representations of action requests and action responses to be supported at the client-application service interface. The services are described in a programming language independent way.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 is the application interface of the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model defined in ISO/IEC 7498-1. It provides a high-level interface for a client-application making use of information storage and processing operations of a card-application as viewed on the generic card interface.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 does not mandate a specific implementation methodology for this interface.</p>
