  content: "IEC TS 62966-3:2021 defines the requirements for operational and personal
    safety of aisle containments for IT cabinets.<br />\r\nThe aim is to provide physical
    security for the IT equipment installed in the containment using the criteria
    “availability” and “safety”.<br />\r\nThe requirements apply to all operational,
    working and maintenance procedures.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to ordinary
    persons, when using installations and equipment.<br />\r\nThe requirements described
    herein are also intended to ensure that it is possible for authorized personnel
    to enter and remain in the containment (as accessible equipment) and to maintain
    or upgrade the systems installed in the containment without risk. It should also
    be possible to evacuate the containment quickly and safely at any time, especially
    in the event of a fire or any other hazardous situation, whilst reducing the health
    risk to personnel to a minimum.<br />\r\nAspects relating to computing, data processing,
    data storage, building protection or the data centre itself do not fall within
    the scope of this document. Only those additional aspects arising from the integration
    of an aisle containment are considered.<br />\r\nThe design and positioning of
    an aisle containment, which is integrated in the data centre, has influence on
    the following different aspects of operational safety:<br />\r\na) escape and
    evacuation plans;<br />\r\nb) escape routes;<br />\r\nc) emergency exits;<br />\r\nd)
    functional aspects of escape doors;<br />\r\ne) lighting conditions<br />\r\nf)
    lighting and signposting of escape routes;<br />\r\ng) fire protection.<br />\r\nIn
    this document, these operational safety requirements and recommendations are considered.<br
    />\r\nTo achieve the highest effectiveness, all these requirements are considered
    as much as possible during the design of an aisle containment.<br />\r\nThis document
    applies to normal operations, not to the initial installation of the containment."
