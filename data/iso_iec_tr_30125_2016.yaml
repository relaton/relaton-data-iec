abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 30125:2016 provides guidance for developing a consistent and
    secure method of biometric (either alone or supported by non-biometric) personalization
    and authentication in a mobile environment for systems procured on the open market.<p>Guidance
    is provided for</p><p>- 1:1 verification or 1:few positive identification;</p><p>-
    biometric sample capture in the mobile environment where conditions are not well
    controlled and not covered in ISO/IEC Biometric interchange format standards and
    the ISO/IEC Biometric sample quality Technical Reports;</p><p>NOTE 1 Further information
    regarding architectures may be found in NIST/SP 500-288.</p><p>- the best use
    of multiple biometric and non-biometric (PINs, passwords, personal data) personalization
    and authentication methods (i.e. multifactor).</p><p>NOTE 2 More information may
    be found in ISO/IEC 30108â€‘1.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 30125:2016 defines a framework to
    address methods and approaches for remote and unsupervised enrolment, together
    with secure storage and transmission of biometric and supporting biographic data,
    covering a variety of both online connected and offline modes.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR
    30125:2016 identifies the functional elements and components of a generic mobile
    biometric system and the distinct characteristics of each component. It provides
    guidance related to a generic mobile architecture with reference to supporting
    standards.</p><p>The context recognizes a) the user as being mobile and b) operation
    across a variety of platforms, particularly mobile devices but also including
    tablet, laptop and other personal computing devices. The key to defining this
    context is whether the user's environment is physically controlled by the organization
    to which the user seeks access.</p>
