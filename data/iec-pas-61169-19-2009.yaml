    and rules for preparation of detail specification of SSMB series R.F. connectors
    together with the pro forma blank detail specification. The SSMB series connectors
    with characteristic impedance 50 ohm are one kind of low power miniature connectors
    with snap-on coupling mechanism and have the characteristics of light weight,
    small size, convenient connection and excellent characteristics. This connector
    range is suitable for the standard ranges of flexible and semi-rigid cables and
    is also available as a PCB mounted version. The connectors are usable up to a
    frequency of 3 GHz.
