  content: "IEC TS 62715-5-2:2016(E) specifies the general rules and the details of
    optical measuring methods from a fixed point (the so-called vantage point) for
    curved emissive and transmissive type displays such as OLED and LCD in dark room
    conditions. This document focuses on concave shape large screen displays (non-portable)
    around a horizontal and/or vertical axis with fixed or variable curvature radius.
    The measuring method stipulated in this technical specification is applied to
    the curved display modules under the following states:<br />\r\n- vantage-point
    luminance variation by viewing angles<br />\r\n- vantage-point contrast ratio
    variation by viewing angles<br />\r\n- vantage-point chromaticity variation of
    white colour by viewing angles<br />\r\n- vantage-point colour gamut area variation
    by viewing angles<br />\r\n- vantage-point chromaticity variation of primary colours
    by viewing angles<br />\r\n- luminance uniformity and its uniformity variation
    by viewing angles<br />\r\n- chromaticity uniformity and its uniformity variation
    by viewing angles<br />\r\n- viewing angle of half-luminance<br />\r\n- viewing
    angle of half-contrast."
