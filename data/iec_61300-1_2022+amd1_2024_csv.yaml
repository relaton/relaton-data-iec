abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-1:2022+AMD1:2024 CSV provides general information and guidance
    for the basic test and measurement procedures defined in IEC 61300-2 (all parts)
    and IEC 61300-3 (all parts) for interconnecting devices, passive components, mechanical
    splices, fusion splice protectors, fibre management systems and protective housings.
    This document is used in combination with the relevant specification which defines
    the tests to be used, the required degree of severity for each of them, their
    sequence, if relevant, and the permissible performance limits. In the event of
    conflict between this document and the relevant specification, the latter takes
    precedence. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published
    in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- addition of the information of measurement uncertainties in 4.2.1;<br
    />\r\n- change of the requirements for attenuation variation in 4.2.2;<br />\r\n-
    addition of the multimode launch conditions of other fibres than A1-OM2, A1-OM3,
    A1-OM4, A1-OM5 and A3e in 10.4;<br />\r\n- addition of the multimode launch conditions
    of the planer waveguide in 10.6;<br />\r\n- splitting Annex A for EF and Annex
    B for EAF;<br />\r\n- correction of errors in the definitions of encircled flux
    and encircled angular flux."
