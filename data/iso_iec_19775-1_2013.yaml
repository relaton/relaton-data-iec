abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19775, X3D, defines a software system that integrates network-enabled 3D graphics
    and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based space that
    contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a
    variety of mechanisms. ISO/IEC 19775-1:2013 defines the architecture and base
    components of X3D. The semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional behaviour
    of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information. ISO/IEC 19775-1:2013 does
    not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts (e.g.
    screen resolution and input devices). It is intended for a wide variety of devices
    and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation
    of the functionality. For example, it does not assume the existence of a mouse
    or 2D display device. Each X3D application: 1) implicitly establishes a world
    coordinate space for all objects defined, as well as all objects included by the
    application; 2) explicitly defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects;
    3) can specify hyperlinks to other files and applications; 4) can define programmatic
    or data-driven object behaviours; 5) can connect to external modules or applications
    via programming and scripting languages; 6) explicitly declares its functional
    requirements by specifying a profile; 7) can declare additional functional requirements
    by specifying components."
