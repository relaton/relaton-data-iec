    <p>ISO/IEC 19775 Extensible 3D (X3D) defines a software system that integrates network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms. This document defines the architecture and base components of X3D.</p>
    <p>The semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information. This document does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts ( <em>e.g.</em>, screen resolution and input devices). This document is intended for a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation of the functionality. For example, this document does not assume the existence of a mouse or 2D display device.</p>
    <p>Each X3D application:</p>
    <ol start="1" type="a">
    <li>implicitly establishes a world coordinate space for all objects defined, as well as all objects included by the application,</li>
    <li>explicitly defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects,</li>
    <li>can specify hyperlinks to other files and applications,</li>
    <li>can define programmatic or data-driven object behaviours,</li>
    <li>can connect to external modules or applications via programming and scripting languages,</li>
    <li>explicitly declares its functional requirements by specifying a profile, and</li>
    <li>can declare additional functional requirements by specifying components.</li>
    </ol>
