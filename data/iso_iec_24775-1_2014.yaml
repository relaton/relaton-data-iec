abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24775-1:2014(E) defines an interface for the secure, extensible,
    and interoperable management of a distributed and heterogeneous storage system.
    This interface uses an object-oriented, XML-based, messaging-based protocol designed
    to support the specific requirements of managing devices and subsystems in this
    storage environment. Using this protocol, this part of ISO/IEC 24775 describes
    the information available to a WBEM Client from an Information Technology - Storage
    Management compliant CIM WBEM Server. This International Standard, together with
    ISO/IEC 24775-2 to ISO/IEC 24775-8, replaces ISO/IEC 24775, second edition, published
    in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision. The significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition are listed in the INTRODUCTION.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with  the IEC 24775 series."
