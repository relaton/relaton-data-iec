abstract:
- content: IEC 61225:2025 specifies the performance and the functional characteristics
    of the low voltage static uninterruptible power supply (SUPS) systems in a nuclear
    power plant (NPP) and, when applicable, in nuclear facilities in general. An uninterruptible
    power supply (UPS) is an electrical equipment which draws electrical energy from
    a source, stores it, and maintains the supply in a specified form by means inside
    the equipment to output terminals. A SUPS has no rotating parts to perform its
    functions. The specific design requirements for the components of the power supply
    system are covered by IEC standards and other standards listed in the normative
    references. Otherwise, specific component-level design requirements are outside
    the scope of this document.
