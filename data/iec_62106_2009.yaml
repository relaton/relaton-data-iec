    IEC 62106:2009(E) describes the Radio Data System, RDS, intended for application to VHF/FM sound broadcasts in the range 87,5 MHz to 108,0 MHz which may carry either stereophonic (pilot-tone system) or monophonic programmes. The main objectives of RDS are to enable improved functionality for FM receivers and to make them more user-friendly by using features such as Programme Identification, Programme Service name display and where applicable, automatic tuning for portable and car radios, in particular. The relevant basic tuning and switching information therefore has to be implemented by the type 0 group (see 6.1.5.1), and it is not optional unlike many of the other possible features in RDS. This edition constitutes a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br />
    - the list of RDS country codes, inclusive of the extended country codes, has been updated in Annexes D and N;<br />
    - Annex E, containing the character code tables to be used in RDS has been updated;<br />
    - RadioText Plus has been added as a new feature in Annex P;<br />
    - Enhanced RadioText has been added as a new feature in Annex Q.

    The contents of the corrigendum of May 2010 have been included in this copy.
