    <p>For the purpose of biometric comparison, ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013 specifies a data interchange format for processed signature/sign behavioural data extracted from a time series, captured using devices such as digitizing tablets, pen-based computing devices, or advanced pen systems.</p>
    <p>The data interchange format is generic, in that it may be applied and used in a wide range of application areas where handwritten signs or signature/signs are involved. No application-specific requirements or features are addressed in ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013 contains definitions of relevant terms, a description of what data is extracted, and a data format for containing the data, together with advice on whether a set of user's signature/sign is suitable for identification purposes using ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013.</p>
    <p>It is advisable that stored and transmitted biometric data is time-stamped and that cryptographic techniques be used to protect their authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality; however, such provisions are beyond the scope of ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013.</p>
