abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-10:2012 specifies advanced video coding for the coding
    of audio-visual objects.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14496-10:2012 was developed in response
    to a growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications
    such as digital storage media, television broadcasting, Internet streaming, and
    real-time audiovisual communication. ISO/IEC 14496-10:2012 specifies a coded video
    representation syntax and an associated decoding process that are suitable for
    use in a wide variety of applications and network environments.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    14496-10:2012 includes the specification of advanced video coding (AVC) and associated
    extensions to enable scalable video coding (SVC) and multiview video coding (MVC).</p>"
