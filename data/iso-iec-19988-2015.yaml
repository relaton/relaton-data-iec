    <p>ISO/IEC 19988:2015 This GS1 Standard defines the Core Business Vocabulary (CBV).  The goal of this standard is to specify various vocabulary elements and their values for use in conjunction with the EPCIS standard [EPCIS1.1], which defines mechanisms to exchange information both within and across organization boundaries.  The vocabulary identifiers and definitions in this standard will ensure that all parties who exchange EPCIS data using the Core Business Vocabulary will have a common understanding of the semantic meaning of that data.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19988:2015 is intended to provide a basic capability that meets the above goal.  In particular, this standard is designed to define vocabularies that are <i>core</i> to the EPCIS abstract data model and are applicable to a broad set of business scenarios common to many industries that have a desire or requirement to share data.  This standard intends to provide a useful set of values and definitions that can be consistently understood by each party in the supply chain.</p>
    <p>Additional end user requirements may be addressed by augmenting the vocabulary elements herein with additional vocabulary elements defined for a particular industry or a set of users or a single user. Additional values for the standard vocabulary types defined in this standard may be included in follow-on versions of this standard. </p>
