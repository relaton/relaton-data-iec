    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60227-7:2024
    details the particular specifications for polyvinyl chloride insulated, screened
    and unscreened control cables of rated voltages up to and including 300/500 V.
    This document provides the particular requirements for screened and unscreened
    control cables of rated voltages up to and including 300/500 V, which apply in
    addition to the appropriate requirements specified in IEC 60227-1, which apply
    to all cables. The tests for cables specified in the IEC 60227 series are described
