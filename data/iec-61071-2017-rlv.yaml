  content: "IEC 61071:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61071:2017
    applies to capacitors for power electronics applications. The operating frequency
    of the systems in which these capacitors are used is usually up to 15 kHz, while
    the pulse frequencies may be up to 5 to 10 times the operating frequency. The
    document distinguishes between AC and DC capacitors which are considered as components
    when mounted in enclosures. This document covers an extremely wide range of capacitor
    technologies for numerous applications, e.g. overvoltage protection, DC and filtering,
    switching circuits, energy storage, auxiliary inverters, etc. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Introduction of new terms
    and definitions;<br />\r\n- clarifications for surge discharge test;<br />\r\n-
    indications for measuring procedure during thermal stability test;<br />\r\n-
    clarifications for self-healing test;<br />\r\n- clarifications for endurance
    test;<br />\r\n- clarifications for destruction test;<br />\r\n- update of normative
    references;<br />\r\n- general editorial review."
