abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11179-4:2004 specifies requirements and recommendations for constructing definitions
    for data and metadata. Only semantic aspects of definitions are addressed; specifications
    for formatting the definitions are deemed unnecessary for the purposes of this
    standard. While especially applicable to the content of metadata registries as
    specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3, ISO/IEC 11179-4:2004 is useful broadly for developing
    definitions for data and metadata.<br />\r\nThese definitional requirements and
    recommendations pertain to formulating definitions for data elements and other
    types of data constructs such as entity types, entities, relationships, attributes,
    object types (or classes), objects, composites, code entries, metadata items,
    and the data referred to by XML tags."
