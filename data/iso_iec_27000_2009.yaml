abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 27000:2009 provides an overview of information security management
    systems, which form the subject of the information security management system
    (ISMS) family of standards, and defines related terms. As a result of implementing
    ISO/IEC 27000:2009, all types of organization (e.g. commercial enterprises, government
    agencies and non-profit organizations) are expected to obtain: an overview of
    the ISMS family of standards; an introduction to information security management
    systems (ISMS); a brief description of the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) process; and
    an understanding of terms and definitions in use throughout the ISMS family of
    standards. The objectives of ISO/IEC 27000:2009 are to provide terms and definitions,
    and an introduction to the ISMS family of standards that: define requirements
    for an ISMS and for those certifying such systems; provide direct support, detailed
    guidance and/or interpretation for the overall Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) processes
    and requirements; address sector-specific guidelines for ISMS; and address conformity
    assessment for ISMS.'
