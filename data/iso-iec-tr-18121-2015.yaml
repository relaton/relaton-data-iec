    <p>ISO/IEC TR 18121:2015 defines the framework for IT standards and specifications on virtual experiments supporting IT-enhanced learning, education and training. It is based on implementations of standards and specifications that are used to support virtual experiment, development, evaluation and management that rely on ITLET.</p>
    <p>This ISO/IEC TR 18121:2015</p>
    <p>-      provides a framework that can be used for virtual experiment systems that rely on ITLET,</p>
    <p>-      determines the categories of different virtual experiment standards and specifications and their relationships to facilitate their integration,</p>
    <p>-      promotes the appropriate design and application of virtual experiment components so that IT systems that are being used are reusable, low cost, and more broadly applicable,</p>
    <p>-      indicates considerations to be taken into account when developing ITLET systems that are being developed or used to support virtual experiment systems,</p>
    <p>-      provides sample architecture of a virtual experiment system framework that can be used to support further development of virtual experiments,</p>
    <p>-      illustrates various roles that different actors can have at various points within the virtual experiment system,</p>
    <p>-      demonstrates how standards and specifications that support virtual experiments can be combined to form the basis for future work and implementations.</p>
    <p>The following aspects are not addressed in this ISO/IEC TR 18121:2015:</p>
    <p>-      specifications of the implementation details of virtual experiment systems;</p>
    <p>-      accessibility;</p>
    <p>-      privacy;</p>
    <p>-      security.</p>
