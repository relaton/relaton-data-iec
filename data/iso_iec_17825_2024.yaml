abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies the non-invasive attack
    mitigation test metrics for determining conformance to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 for security levels 3 and 4. The test metrics are associated
    with the security functions addressed in ISO/IEC 19790:2012. Testing is conducted
    at the defined boundary of the cryptographic module and the inputs/outputs available
    at its defined boundary.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document is intended to
    be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 24759:2017 to demonstrate conformance to ISO/IEC
    19790:2012.</p><p class="Note">NOTE ISO/IEC 24759:2017 specifies the test methods
    used by testing laboratories to assess whether the cryptographic module conforms
    to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and the test metrics specified
    in this document for each of the associated security functions addressed in ISO/IEC
    19790:2012.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The test approach employed in this document
    is an efficient “push-button” approach, i.e. the tests are technically sound,
    repeatable and have moderate costs.</p>
