abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000-64:2012 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 960 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and
    Medical (ISM) band used in item management applications. It provides a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards.   It is intended to allow for compatibility and to
    encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international
    marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes
    including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy,
    occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP),
    spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy,
    bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency
    hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines
    the communications protocol used in the air interface.  ISO/IEC 18000-64:2012
    specifies the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter, Tag
    Only Talks After Listening (TOTAL) RFID system. The system comprises Interrogators,
    also known as readers, and tags, also known as labels. An Interrogator receives
    information from a tag by transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal to the
    tag; the tag responds by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna,
    thereby backscattering an information signal to the Interrogator. The system is
    TOTAL, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an
    information signal upon entering an Interrogator's field after first listening
    for Interrogator modulation in order to determine if the system is ITF or not.  ISO/IEC
    18000-64:2012 contains Type D.  Type D is TOTAL based on Pulse Position Encoding
    or Miller M=2 encoded subcarrier.  ISO/IEC 18000-64:2012 specifies           physical
    interactions (the signalling layer of the communication link) between Interrogators
    and tags,          Interrogator and tag operating procedures,          the collision
    arbitration scheme used to identify a specific tag in a multiple-tag environment.
