abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 specifies scene, photographic, digitization and
    format requirements for images of faces to be used in the context of both human
    verification and computer automated recognition. The approach to specifying scene
    and photographic requirements in this format is to carefully describe constraints
    on how a photograph should appear rather than to dictate how the photograph should
    be taken. The format is designed to allow for the specification of visible information
    discernable by an observer pertaining to the face, such as gender, pose and eye
    colour. The digital image format can be either ISO standard JPEG or JPEG2000.
    Finally, the 'best practice' appendices provide guidance on photo capture for
    travel documents and face recognition performance versus digital compression.</p><p>This
    consolidated reprint of ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 contains the original content of
    ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 and incorporates the Amendments ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005/Amd
