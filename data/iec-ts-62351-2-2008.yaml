  content: "IEC 62351-2:2008 (E) covers the key terms used in the IEC 62351 series,
    and is not meant to be a definitive list. Most terms used for cyber security are
    formally defined by other standards organizations, and so are included here with
    references to where they were originally defined.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication
    is of core relevance for Smart Grid."
