abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-2:2010 defines a digital interface for connecting transducers
    to microprocessors. It describes a Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS) and
    its data formats. It defines an electrical interface, read and write logic functions
    to access the TEDS, and a wide variety of transducers. ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-2:2010
    does not specify signal conditioning, signal conversion, or how the TEDS data
    is used in applications.
