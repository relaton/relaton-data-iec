abstract:
- content: "IEC 60794-2-22:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60794-2-22:
    2023 specifies breakout optical cables with multiple simplex optical fibre cables
    for use in terminated breakout cable assemblies. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) changed partly the wording in the
    title and the scope to align with IEC 60794-2-50, IEC 60794-2-23 and IEC 60794-2-24;<br
    />\r\nb) added IEC 60793-1-40, IEC 60793-1-46 and IEC 60794-1-2 to the normative
    references;<br />\r\nc) deleted reference to IEC 60794-2-51;<br />\r\nd) added
    the definition of terminated breakout cable assembly;<br />\r\ne) changed the
    number of bend cycles from 10 to 3 to harmonise with IEC 60794-2-50;<br />\r\nf)
    changed test parameters for temperature cycling to harmonise with IEC 60794-2-50;<br
    />\r\ng) added maximum attenuation requirements after temperature cycling;<br
    />\r\nh) replaced the text for the fire performance with an improved description."
