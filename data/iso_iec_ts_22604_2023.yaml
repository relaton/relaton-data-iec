abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document establishes requirements for development
    of biometric solutions for verification and identification processes for secure
    access without physical contact with any device at any time. The solution acquires
    the biometric characteristics that are captured while the data subjects are in
    motion to verify or identify the individuals requiring access, and thus controlling
    access using contactless biometrics.</p>
