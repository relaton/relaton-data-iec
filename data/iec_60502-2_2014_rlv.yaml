abstract:
- content: "IEC 60502-2:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60502-2:2014 specifies
    the construction, dimensions and test requirements of power cables with extruded
    solid insulation from 6 kV up to 30 kV for fixed installations such as distribution
    networks or industrial installations. When determining applications, it is recommended
    that the possible risk of radial water ingress is considered. Cable designs with
    barriers claimed to prevent longitudinal water penetration and an associated test
    are included in this part of IEC 60502. Cables for special installation and service
    conditions are not included, for example cables for overhead networks, the mining
    industry, nuclear power plants (in and around the containment area) nor for submarine
    use or shipboard application. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition, published in 2005, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) a simplified calculation procedure for the thickness of the
    lead sheath and the oversheath;<br />\r\nb) a new subclause for the determination
    of the cable conductor temperature;<br />\r\nc) a modified procedure for the routine
    voltage test;<br />\r\nd) a new subclause for a routine electrical test on oversheath;<br
    />\r\ne) modified requirements for the non-metal sheaths including semi-conductive
    layer;<br />\r\nf) modified tolerances for the bending test cylinder;<br />\r\ng)
    the inclusion of a 0,1Hz test after installation.<br />\r\nIn addition, the modified
    structure of the IEC 60811 series has been adopted for this third edition."
