    <p>ISO/IEC 27033-4:2014 gives guidance for securing communications between networks using security gateways (firewall, application firewall, Intrusion Protection System, etc.) in accordance with a documented information security policy of the security gateways, including:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>identifying and analysing network security threats associated with security gateways;</li>
    <li>defining network security requirements for security gateways based on threat analysis;</li>
    <li>using techniques for design and implementation to address the threats and control aspects associated with typical network scenarios; and</li>
    <li>addressing issues associated with implementing, operating, monitoring and reviewing network security gateway controls.</li>
