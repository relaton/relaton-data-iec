abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a standard notation called Abstract Syntax Notation
    One (ASN.1) that is used for the definition of data types, values, and constraints
    on data types.</p><p>This document:</p><p>– defines a number of simple types,
    with their tags, and specifies a notation for referencing these types and for
    specifying values of these types;</p><p>– defines mechanisms for constructing
    new types from more basic types, and specifies a notation for defining such types
    and assigning them tags, and for specifying values of these types;</p><p>– defines
    character sets (by reference to other Recommendations and/or International Standards)
    for use within ASN.1.</p><p>The ASN.1 notation can be applied whenever it is necessary
    to define the abstract syntax of information.</p><p>The ASN.1 notation is referenced
    by other standards which define encoding rules for the ASN.1 types.</p>"
