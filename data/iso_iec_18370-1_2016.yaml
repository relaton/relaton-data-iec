abstract:
- content: ISO 18370-1:2016 specifies principles, including a general model, a set
    of entities, a number of processes, and general requirements for blind digital
    signature mechanisms, as well as the following variants of blind digital signature
    mechanisms:<p>- blind signature mechanisms with partial disclosure;</p><p>- blind
    signature mechanisms with selective disclosure;</p><p>- traceable blind signature
    mechanisms.</p><p>It also contains terms, definitions, abbreviated terms and figure
    elements that are used in all parts of ISO/IEC 18370.</p><p>See Annex A for a
    comparison on the blind digital signature mechanisms.</p>
