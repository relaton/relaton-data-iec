abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63468:2023 overviews the fundamentals of artificial intelligence
    (AI) as it could potentially be applied within nuclear facilities and identifies
    proven or potential applications, with the objective to foster better understanding
    and adoption of AI technologies within such facilities. With the objective of
    supporting future standard development work of IEC SC 45A in this technical area,
    this document takes the initiative to propose a structure for SC 45A standard
    series on nuclear AI applications and recommends setting up a new dedicated working
    group to be responsible for and coordinate standard development efforts in this
    particular area, taking into account its cross-cutting nature.
