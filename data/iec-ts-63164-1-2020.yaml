  content: "IEC 63164-1:2020(E) provides guidance on the assurance of reliability
    data of automation devices. If the source of this data is calculation, guidance
    is given on how to specify the methods used for this calculation. If the source
    is from observation of devices in the field, guidance is given on how to describe
    these observations and their evaluations. If the source is the outcome of laboratory
    tests, guidance is given on how to specify these tests and the conditions under
    which they have been carried out.<br />\r\nThis document defines the form to present
    the data.<br />\r\nThe components considered in this document are assumed not
    to need any break-in phase before full range usage.<br />\r\nWhen devices are
    used for functional safety application, the requirements of IEC 61508 (all parts)
    and related standards are considered."
