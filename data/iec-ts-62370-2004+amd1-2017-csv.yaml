- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: IEC TS 62370:2004+A1:2017 specifies requirements for instruments that measure
    sound intensity using pairs of pressure sensing microphones with respect to their
    immunity to power- and radio-frequency fields and to electrostatic discharge,
    and the permitted radio-frequency emissions, together with test procedures to
    verify conformance. Sound intensity measuring instruments are available in many
    different configurations and may be powered by batteries or from external power
    supply systems. The technical requirements in this Technical Specification apply
    to all configurations of instruments for the measurement of sound intensity. The
    electromagnetic and electrostatic compatibility requirements are equally applicable
    for sound intensity measuring instruments used in residential, commercial and
    light-industrial environments, or industrial sites. The requirements of this Technical
    Specification are additional to those contained in IEC 61043 and do not alter
    any of the specifications contained therein. The requirements do not apply retrospectively
    to sound intensity measuring instruments complying with IEC 61043 prior to the
    publication of this Technical Specification. <strong>This consolidated version
    consists of the first edition (2004) and its amendment 1 (2017). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>
