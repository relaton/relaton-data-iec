abstract:
- content: "IEC 61340-4-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61340-4-5:2018
    specifies test methods for evaluating electrostatic protection provided by a system
    of footwear and flooring in combination with a person. Test results are valid
    only for the specific footwear and flooring combination tested. The test methods
    are not intended for individual product qualification purposes. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) normative references have been updated;<br />\r\nb) Figure 2 has been
    improved and expanded to include actual examples of body voltage recordings, and
    text has been added to explain how to interpret recordings;<br />\r\nc) an alternative
    walking pattern has been added in an informative annex."
