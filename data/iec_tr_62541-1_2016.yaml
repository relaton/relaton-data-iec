abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62541-1:2016(E) is a Technical Report and presents the concepts
    and overview of the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Reading this document is

    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC TR 62541-1,
    published in 2010. This edition includes no technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition but includes updates to reflect changes or additions in normative
    parts of IEC 62541.
