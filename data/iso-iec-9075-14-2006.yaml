    <p>ISO/IEC 9075 defines the SQL database language. The scope of SQL is the definition of data structure and the operations on data stored in that structure. ISO/IEC 9075-1, -2 and -11 encompass the minimum requirements of the language. Other parts define extensions. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9075-14:2006 defines ways in which SQL can be used in conjunction with XML. It defines ways of importing and storing XML data in an SQL database, manipulating it within the database and publishing both XML and conventional SQL-data in XML form. In addition, it provides facilities that permit applications to integrate into their SQL code the use of XQuery, the XML Query Language published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), to concurrently access ordinary SQL-data and XML documents.</p>
