  content: "IEC/TR 61000-1-6:2012(E), which is a technical report, provides methods
    and background information for the assessment of measurement uncertainty. It gives
    guidance to cover general measurement uncertainty considerations within the IEC
    61000 series. The objectives of this Technical Report are to give advice to technical
    committees, product committees and conformity assessment bodies on the development
    of measurement uncertainty budgets; to allow the comparison of these budgets between
    laboratories that have similar influence quantities; and to align the treatment
    of measurement uncertainty across the EMC committees of the IEC. It gives a description
    for:<br />\r\n- a method for the assessment of measurement uncertainty;<br />\r\n-
    mathematical formulas for probability density functions;<br />\r\n- analytical
    assessment of statistical evaluations;<br />\r\n- correction of measured data;
    and<br />\r\n- documentation. This Technical Report is not intended to summarize
    all measurement uncertainty influence quantities nor is it intended to define
    how measurement uncertainty is to be taken into account in determining compliance
    with an EMC requirement. The contents of the corrigendum of october 2014 have
    been included in this copy."
