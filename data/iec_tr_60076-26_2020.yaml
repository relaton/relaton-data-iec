abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60076-26: 2020 which is a Technical Report, provides the functional
    requirements of insulating liquids that are considered necessary for use in power
    transformers, including, for example, reactors and HVDC transformers, are assembled
    and listed. A relevance index of importance for design and for service as well
    as the status of validation is given for all individual requirements (parameters).
    All parameters are assigned to one of the following categories:<ul><li>General
    (physical / chemical)</li><li>Dielectric / Insulation</li><li>Thermal / Cooling</li><li>Ageing
    and Stability</li><li>Liquid-solid system</li><li>Material compatibility</li></ul>\r\nThe
    document is intended to serve as a general reference document for the transformer
    industry, including liquid suppliers as well as relevant scientific and technical
    bodies dealing with insulating liquids (materials)."
