  content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO 20294:2018 This document specifies
    the requirements for quantifying the carbon footprint of those processes, materials
    and technologies within the user's knowledge and control that are necessary for
    the delivery and use of e-media. It covers requirements to account for e-media
    archiving, distribution, use and storage. It is based on a life cycle assessment
    (LCA) approach, using defined system boundaries and a specified functional unit
    as the basis for complete or partial carbon footprinting studies. These data can
    be referenced throughout supply chains for individual e-media products.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to a carbon footprint of a product (CFP) study of e-media
    regarding contents and e-media devices.<br />\r\nThis document provides a framework
    for carbon calculators that organisations can follow and that can be used as the
    structure for market- or sector-specific carbon footprinting tools. Studies and
    tools constructed within this framework methodology provide carbon footprint quantifications
    of e-media that can be validated, verified and provide reference for future studies.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not assess any social or economic aspects or impacts,
    or any other environmental aspects and related impacts potentially arising from
    the life cycle of a product."
