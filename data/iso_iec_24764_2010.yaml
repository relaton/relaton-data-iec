    of communications services for use within a data centre. It covers balanced cabling
    and optical fibre cabling. It is based upon and references the requirements of
    ISO/IEC 11801 and contains additional requirements that are appropriate to data
    centres in which the maximum distance over which communications services have
    to be distributed is 2 000 m.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in
    conjunction with ISO/IEC 11801:2002, its amendment 1:2008and its amendment 2:2010."
