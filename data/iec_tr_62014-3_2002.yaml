abstract:
- content: Describes a model for EMI simulation due to IC internal activities. Gives
    more accurately the electromagnetic emissions of electronic equipment by taking
    into account the influence of internal activities. Gives general data which could
    be implemented in different format such as IBIS, IMIC, SPICE, etc
