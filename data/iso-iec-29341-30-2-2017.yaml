    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-30-2:2017 defines the device for IOT Management and Control, which identifies Level 1 of the device named IOT Management and Control. This Publicly Available Specification is applicable to Standardized DCPs of the UPnP Forum which include this device.</p>
    <p>This device definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [1]. It defines a device type referred to herein as IOT Management and Control device.</p>
    <p>This specification defines a general-purpose device that can be used to instantiate a bridge or gateway device that is connected to Sensors and Actuators. This device implements a bridge between the UPnP network and Sensors/Actuators endpoints. It exposes services to check the status, and send and receive data from Sensors. Sensors/Actuators may be connected using a variety of transport protocols including Bluetooth, ZigBee and IEEE 11073.</p>
