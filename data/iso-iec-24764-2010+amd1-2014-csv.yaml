  content: "ISO/IEC 24764:2010+A1:2014 specifies generic cabling that supports a wide
    range of communications services for use within a data centre. It covers balanced
    cabling and optical fibre cabling. It is based upon and references the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 11801 and contains additional requirements that are appropriate to
    data centres in which the maximum distance over which communications services
    have to be distributed is 2 000 m.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be
