abstract:
- content: IEC 62442-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 62442-2:2018 defines
    a measurement method of the power losses of electromagnetic controlgear, the total
    input power and the standby power of electronic controlgear for high intensity
    discharged lamps (excluding fluorescent lamps). A calculation method of the efficiency
    of controlgear for high intensity discharged lamp(s) is also defined. It is assumed
    that the controlgear are designed for use on DC supplies up to 1 000 V and/or
    AC supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision
    and has been harmonized with IEC 62442-1 and IEC 62442-3.</p>
