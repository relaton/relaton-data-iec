    Is the first part in a series of standards that define interfaces for the major elements of an interface architecture for Distribution Management Systems. Identifies and establishes requirements for standard interfaces based on an Interface Reference Model. This set of standards is limited to the definition of interfaces and is implementation independent; it provides for interoperability among different computer systems, platforms, and languages.
