abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19761:2003 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and
    activities of the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable
    to software from the following functional domains:</p><ol><li>application software
    which is needed to support business administration;</li><li>real-time software,
    the task of which is to keep up with or control events happening in the real world;</li><li>hybrids
    of the above.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC 19761:2003 has not been designed for measuring
    the functional size of a piece of software, or its parts, which:</p><ol><li>are
    characterized by complex mathematical algorithms or other specialized and complex
    rules, such as may be found in expert systems, simulation software, self-learning
    software and weather forecasting systems, or</li><li>process continuous variables
    such as audio sounds or video images, such as may be found, for instance, in computer
    game software, musical instruments and the like.</li></ol><p>However, within the
    local environment of an organisation using the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement
    Method, it may be possible to measure these FUR in a way which is meaningful as
    a local standard. ISO/IEC 19761:2003 contains provision for the local customisation
    of the method for this purpose.</p>"
