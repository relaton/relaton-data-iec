abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19761:2003 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities
    of the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable to software
    from the following functional domains:application software which is needed to
    support business administration;real-time software, the task of which is to keep
    up with or control events happening in the real world;hybrids of the above.ISO/IEC
    19761:2003 has not been designed for measuring the functional size of a piece
    of software, or its parts, which:are characterized by complex mathematical algorithms
    or other specialized and complex rules, such as may be found in expert systems,
    simulation software, self-learning software and weather forecasting systems, orprocess
    continuous variables such as audio sounds or video images, such as may be found,
    for instance, in computer game software, musical instruments and the like.However,
    within the local environment of an organisation using the COSMIC-FFP Functional
    Size Measurement Method, it may be possible to measure these FUR in a way which
    is meaningful as a local standard. ISO/IEC 19761:2003 contains provision for the
    local customisation of the method for this purpose.
