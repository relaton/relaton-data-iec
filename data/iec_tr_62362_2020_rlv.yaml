abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62362:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/TR 62362: 2020
    which is a technical report, provides information on the specification of optical
    fibre cables with respect to the mechanical, ingress, climatic and chemical or
    electromagnetic characteristics (MICE) as classified in ISO/IEC 11801-1. In this
    classification system, each letter of the four initials of the acronym are subscripted
    with a value from one to three to indicate different severities. The current attributes
    and severities are found in Annex A. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2010. It constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- replacement of references and information from ISO/IEC
    24702 and ISO/IEC 11801 with ISO/IEC 11801-1;<br />\r\n- update of the MICE table;<br
    />\r\n- update of the current optical fibre designations of IEC 60793-2-10 and
    IEC 60793-2-50."
