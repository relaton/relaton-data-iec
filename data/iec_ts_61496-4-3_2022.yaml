- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TS 61496-4-3:2022 is available as IEC TS 61496-4-3:2022
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC TS 61496-4-3:2022
    specifies requirements for the design, construction and testing of non-contact
    electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed specifically to detect
    persons or parts of persons as part of a safety-related system, employing vision-based
    protective devices (VBPDs) using stereo vision techniques (VBPDST) for the sensing
    function. Special attention is directed to features which ensure that an appropriate
    safety-related performance is achieved. An ESPE can include optional safety-related
    functions, the requirements for which are given in Annex A of IEC 61496-1:2020
    and this document. Where this document does not contain all necessary provisions,
    IEC TS 62998-1 applies. It is also possible, for those aspects not considered
    in this document, to use provisions from IEC TS 62998-1 additionally. This document
    does not specify the dimensions or configurations of the detection zone and its
    disposition in relation to hazardous parts for any particular application, nor
    what constitutes a hazardous state of any machine. It is restricted to the functioning
    of the ESPE and how it interfaces with the machine. The detection principle is
    based on the evaluation of images from different viewing points (stereoscopic
    view) for the determination of distance information. This distance information
    is used to determine the position of an object(s).<br />\r\n– This document is
    limited to vision based ESPEs with fixed distances (stereo base) and fixed directions
    of the optical axes using a fixed focal length.<br />\r\n– It is limited to vision
    based ESPEs that do not require human intervention for detection.<br />\r\n– It
    is limited to vision based ESPEs that detect objects entering into or being present
    in a detection zone(s).<br />\r\n– It is limited to VBPDSTs employing radiation
    at wavelengths within the range 400 nm to 1 500 nm.<br />\r\n– This document does
    not address those aspects required for complex classification or differentiation
    of the object detected.<br />\r\n– This document does not consider the aspects
    of a moving ESPE installation.<br />\r\nAdditional requirements and tests can
    apply in the following cases:<br />\r\n– Use of multi-spectral (colour) techniques;<br
    />\r\n– Setups other than as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 (e.g. changing backgrounds,
    horizontal orientation of the optical axis with respect to the floor);<br />\r\n–
    Intended for outdoor applications.<br />\r\nThis document is relevant for VBPDSTs
    having a stated detection capability up to 200 mm. This document can be relevant
    to applications other than those for the protection of persons or parts of persons
    like arm or fingers (in the range 14 mm to 200 mm), for example the protection
    of machinery or products from mechanical damage. In those applications, additional
    requirements can be necessary, for example when the materials that are to be recognized
    by the sensing function have different properties from those of persons. This
    document does not deal with EMC emission requirements.<br />\r\nIEC TS 61496-4-3:2022
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015-05. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Some requirement clauses and test
    procedures have been adapted or removed because they have been consolidated in
    IEC 61496-1:2020 (e.g. 5.4.6.2 Light sources or Clause A.9)."
