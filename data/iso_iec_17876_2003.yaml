abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17876:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Private User Mobility Registration supplementary service (SS-PUMR) at the
    Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs)
    connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>SS-PUMR
    is a supplementary service which enables a PUM user to register at, or de-register
    from, any wired or wireless terminal within the PISN. The ability to register
    at different locations in the PISN at different times enables the PUM user to
    maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls)
    at different access points. De-registration is used to inform the PISN that the
    PUM user is temporarily unable to make use of the provided services (including
    the receipt of calls). SS-PUMR may provide the PUM user with the ability to obtain
    information on the current registration sessions (interrogation).</p><p>The Q
    reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are
    produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130.
    ISO/IEC 17876:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point
    and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 17875.</p><p>The signalling protocol for SS-PUMR uses certain aspects
    of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17876:2003 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between SS-PUMR and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>NOTE Additional
    interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference
    point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.</p>"
