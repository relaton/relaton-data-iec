  content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2:2025 is available as <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/109780\">IEC/IEEE
    60079-30-2:2025 RLV</a> which contains the International Standard and its Redline
    version, showing all changes of the technical content compared to the previous
    edition.</br></br>IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2:2025 provides guidance for the application
    of electrical resistance trace heating systems in areas where explosive atmospheres
    can be present, with the exclusion of those classified as requiring Equipment
    Protection Level (EPL) Ga or Da (traditional relationship to Zone 0 and Zone 20
    respectively). This document also provides guidance for explosive atmospheres
    incorporating the Division method of area classification that can be applied by
    some users of this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides recommendations for
    the design, installation, maintenance and repair of trace heating systems including
    associated control and monitoring equipment. It does not cover devices that operate
    by induction heating, skin effect heating or direct pipeline heating, nor those
    intended for stress relieving.<br />\r\nThis second edition of IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2
    cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2 published in 2015.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) a general review and updating of the first
    edition;<br />\r\nb) the addition of Annex I – Other applications of trace heating
    in explosive atmospheres.<br />\r\nThe significance of changes between IEC/IEEE
    60079-30-2, Edition 1.0 (2015) and IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2, Edition 2.0 (this document)
    can be found on the foreword of this document."
