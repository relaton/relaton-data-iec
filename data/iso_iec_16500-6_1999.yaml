abstract:
- content: <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 takes a practical approach to the specification
    of Information Representation. Just the</p><p>information types that cannot be
    dispensed with in producing the set of DAVIC applications (viz. broadcast, movies</p><p>on
    demand, home shopping, etc.) are specified. The approach taken in this part of
    ISO/IEC 16500 starts by defining</p><p>the various monomedia information types.
    They include character, text, fonts, service information, audio, video, and</p><p>graphics.
    Consistent with DAVIC principles, one tool is selected for the encoding of each
    information type.</p><p>Multimedia components comprise one or more monomedia components.
    This part of ISO/IEC 16500 defines the way</p><p>in which multimedia information
    is coded and exchanged. This includes the definition of a virtual machine and
    a set</p><p>of APIs to support interoperable exchange of program code. Finally,
    this part of ISO/IEC 16500 defines a Reference</p><p>Decoder Model for contents
    decoding which provides constraints on content. The major problem addressed by
    the</p><p>model is to ensure interoperability of applications by specifying memory
    and behaviour constraints for contents</p><p>decoding by a hypothetical STU, without
    specifying the internal design of an STU. An application built according to</p><p>the
    reference decoder model will be an "ISO/IEC 16500 conforming application" and
    will successfully execute on a</p><p>STU that is compliant to ISO/IEC 16500.</p><p>For
    each monomedia and multimedia component the coding format is specified, as well
    as applicable constraints for</p><p>coding of the components. Three types of monomedia
    components are distinguished. Monomedia components which</p><p>are included within
    other monomedia components, such as characters within text, are of type implied.
    Non-implied</p><p>monomedia components that do not require synchronization with
    a time base at play back, are of type stand-alone.</p><p>Finally, non-implied
    monomedia components of which the presentation may require synchronization with
    a time base</p><p>are of type stream. This part of ISO/IEC 16500 defines which
    type each DAVIC defined monomedia component may</p><p>take, and specifies that
    the coded representation of monomedia components of type stream are packetized
    in PES</p><p>packets (for definition of PES packets refer to ISO/IEC 13818-1).
    PES packets permit (1) to include time stamps to</p><p>support mutual synchronisation
    of multiple monomedia components in reference to a common time base and (2) to</p><p>define
    timing and buffer behaviour in a common reference model for contents decoding.
    While there are various</p><p>ways to deliver the monomedia and multimedia components
    to the STU, This part of ISO/IEC 16500 defines how the</p><p>components are carried
    in an MPEG-2 Transport Stream.</p><p>DAVIC specifies a number of different profiles.
    In a specific profile there may be support of a subset of the</p><p>monomedia
    components. Each STU that complies to a specific profile of DAVIC shall be capable
    of decoding and</p><p>presenting each monomedia and multimedia component permitted
    within that profile.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 also specifies methods for
    packaging of contents and metadata. The way in which</p><p>content is packaged
    for delivery is independent of the way in which content data is delivered to the
    SPS (it may be</p><p>delivered to a Service Provider either on physical media
    or over a transmission system). All programming content is</p><p>represented in
    the DAVIC system as multimedia components. Multimedia components comprise one
    or more</p><p>monomedia components coupled with the logical relationships between
    the monomedia components. The multimedia</p><p>components will be created by content
    providers for input to the servers.</p>
