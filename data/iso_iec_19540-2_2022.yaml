abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a normative supplement to the UAF DMM document (c4i/19-06-16).</p><p>This
    document specifies a UAF profile to enable practitioners to express architectural
    model elements and organize them in a set of domains, model kinds, and view specification
    (specified in the UAF DMM) that support the specific needs of end users in defense
    and commercial industry.</p><p>UAFP 1.1 defines a set of stereotypes and model
    elements and relationships to satisfy the requirements of the UPDM 3.0 RFP and
    the UAF DMM. The profile specification documents the language architecture in
    terms of UML profiling mechanism.</p><p>A number of UAFP stereotypes inherit from
    SysML stereotypes where reuse of SysML semantics is necessary. The reusable portions
    of the SysML specification are not included directly in the specification but
    are made explicit through the stereotype inheritance.</p>"
