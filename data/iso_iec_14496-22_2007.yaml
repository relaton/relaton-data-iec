abstract:
- content: '<p>ISO/IEC 14496-22:2007, "Open Font Format Specification", defines the
    extensible font data format representation for interchange of digital font information
    in different multimedia applications.</p><p>Historically, scalable digital fonts
    have come in two basic flavours: PostScript (registered trademark of Adobe Systems
    Incorporated) Type 1 and TrueType (trademark of Apple Computer Incorporated).
    Both of them are multi-platform outline font standards. OpenType (registered trademark
    of Microsoft Corporation) is the unification of these two most powerful and widely
    used font formats, PostScript and TrueType, into a single font format. Designed
    to handle languages with complex typographic requirements, such as Arabic, it
    supports alternate glyphs and contextual ligature substitution.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    14496-22:2007 defines the data format for scalable digital fonts that is based
    on the OpenType specification, version 1.4.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14496-22 addresses the
    following goals:</p><ul><li>high-quality scaling of glyphs, based on the advanced
    TrueType hinting capabilities;</li><li>broader multi-platform support;</li><li>better
    support for international character sets and the Unicode standard;</li><li>better
    protection for font data using digital signatures in font files;</li><li>smaller
    file sizes to make font distribution more efficient;</li><li>broader support for
    advanced typographic features and text layout.</li></ul>'
