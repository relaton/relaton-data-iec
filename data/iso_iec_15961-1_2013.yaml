abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15961-1:2013 focuses on the abstract interface between an application
    and the data processor, and includes the specification and definition of application
    commands and responses. It allows data and commands to be specified in a standardized
    way, independent of the particular air interface of ISO/IEC 18000.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15961-1:2013<br />\r\n\tprovides guidelines on how data shall be presented as
    objects;<br />\r\n\tdefines the structure of Object Identifiers, based on ISO/IEC
    9834-1;<br />\r\n\tspecifies the commands that are supported for transferring
    data between an application and the radio frequency identification (RFID) tag;<br
    />\r\n\tspecifies the responses that are supported for transferring data between
    the RFID tag and the application;<br />\r\n\tdoes not specify any required transfer
    syntax with ISO/IEC 15962, but provides the non-normative information to provide
    backward compatibility with ISO/IEC 15961:2004.<br /><br />"
