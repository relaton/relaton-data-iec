abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-481:2019 defines a device model that is applicable
    to all SCSI devices. Other command standards expand on the general SCSI device
    model in ways appropriate to specific types of SCSI devices.\r\nISO&#x2F;IEC 14776
    (all parts) specifies the interfaces, functions, and operations necessary to ensure
    interoperability between conforming SCSI implementations. This document is a functional
    description. Conforming implementations employ any design technique that does
    not violate interoperability.\r\nThis document defines security features for use
    by all SCSI devices. This document defines the security model that is basic to
    every device model and the parameter data that applies to any device model. For
    additional information on the security goals and threat model discussed in this
    document see Annex A."
