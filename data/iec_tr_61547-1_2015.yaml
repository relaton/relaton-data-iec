abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61547-1:2015(E) establishes an objective method and procedure for
    testing the immunity performance of lighting equipment against voltage fluctuation
    disturbances on the a.c. power port. The object of this Technical Report is to
    establish a common and objective reference for evaluating the immunity of lighting
    equipment in terms of illuminance flicker when subjected to mains voltage fluctuations.
    Temporal changes in the colour of the light (chromatic flicker) are not considered
    in this test.
