  content: "IEC 60981:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60981:2019 specifies
    requirements for extra heavy-duty electrical rigid steel (EHDERS) conduits, couplings,
    nipples and elbows for electrical installations, including communications and
    fibre optics. This document also specifies threads for these components. It is
    not applicable to the conduits specified in IEC 60423. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the second edition:<br />\r\n- addition of provisions
    for alternative coatings to zinc;<br />\r\n- addition of elasticity test for organic
    coatings;<br />\r\n- new Annex B on tests for evaluating alternative exterior
    coatings applied on extra heavy­duty electrical rigid steel (EHDERS) conduits.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol
