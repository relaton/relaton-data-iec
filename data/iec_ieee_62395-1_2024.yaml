abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62395-1:2024 specifies requirements for electrical resistance
    trace heating systems and includes general test requirements.<br />\r\nThis first
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2013. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes, apart from general revisions of IEC 62395-1 and
    harmonization with IEEE 515 [1] and IEEE 515.1 [2], with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Added control and monitoring requirements for fire sprinkler
    systems and safety showers.<br />\r\nb) Provided a supplemental ice bath method
    for verification of rated output.<br />\r\nc) Provided constructional and type
    test requirements for glands used to terminate heating devices to an exposed enclosure."
