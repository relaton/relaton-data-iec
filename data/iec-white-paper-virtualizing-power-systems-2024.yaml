  content: "Digital twins in the energy sector are digital – and often real time –
    representations of the physical grid assets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new IEC White
    Paper on Virtualizing power systems: how digital twins will revolutionize the
    energy sector focuses on the benefits digital twins can bring. Effective use of
    digital twin technologies can help grid planners and grid operators manage their
    systems efficiently, helping them overcome infrastructural challenges. This also
    enables industry to meet net-zero goals by helping planners monitor and identify
    design alternatives to reduce carbon emissions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe paper highlights
    the growing importance of digital twins as we grow into a more connected society,
    with different sectors having to work closely with each other to leverage synergies.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nAddressing challenges in such an implementation, the paper recommends
    among other solutions, the adoption of core standards for describing underlying
    data models, and to create secure open data exchange policies. The recommendations
    provide tangible actions that government agencies, standards bodies, and digital
    twin stakeholders can take to unlock the potential of digital twin technologies
    and their revolutionary impact on the energy sector of the future.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis white paper has been prepared by a project team representing a variety
    of organizations, working under the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>).
    The project team included representatives from electrical power network businesses,
    standards organizations, and equipment vendors from around the world. IEC MSB
    members Dr Hiroshi Okamoto, TEPCO Power Grid, Inc., and Dr Maurizio Bragagni,
    Tratos, Ltd., served as project sponsors. Dr Scott Coe, GridOptimize, served as
    coordinating author and project partner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper
    is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/virtualizing-power-systems-how-digital-twins-will-revolutionize-energy-sector\">free
