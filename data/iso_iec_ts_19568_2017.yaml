abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 19568:2017 describes extensions to the C++ Standard Library
    (1.2). These extensions are classes and functions that are likely to be used widely
    within a program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries written
    by different organizations.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 19568:2017 is non-normative. Some
    of the library components in this technical specification may be considered for
    standardization in a future version of C++, but they are not currently part of
    any C++ standard. Some of the components in this technical specification may never
    be standardized, and others may be standardized in a substantially changed form.<br
    />\r\nThe goal of this technical specification is to build more widespread existing
    practice for an expanded C++ standard library. It gives advice on extensions to
    those vendors who wish to provide them."
