abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 provides a toolbox consisting of lower layer
    protocols and physical interfaces. Each</p><p>tool is applicable at one or more
    of the reference points within the delivery system. The physical delivery media</p><p>that
    have been identified for this version of ISO/IEC 16500-4 are copper pairs, coaxial
    cable, microwave, fiber</p><p>and satellite. Removable information carrying physical
    media (e.g. optical discs and tapes) are not covered. The</p><p>tools listed address
    the three parts of the delivery system, namely, the core network, the access network
    and the</p><p>access-network-independent interface to the Set Top Unit (STU).
    Tools are also identified for the STU dataport</p><p>interface and for a service
    provider system (SPS) internal network and an SPS/SPS core network.</p><p>Clause
    6 specifies in detail the tools provided to digitize the physical media in the
    core network. In the case of a</p><p>broadband core network, all these tools support
    high speed ATM transport. Clause 7 specifies in detail the tools</p><p>provided
    to digitize the physical media in the access network (copper pairs, coax, satellite,
    microwave, fiber). All</p><p>these tools support high speed MPEG-2-TS transport
    and/or high speed ATM transport. Clause 8 concerns the</p><p>access-network-independent
    interface to the STU and provides a detailed specification of the physical interfaces</p><p>between
    the network interface unit (NIU) and the STU. This physical interface can be internal
    or external to the</p><p>Set Top Box (STB) and is independent from the physical
    interface used in the access network. It supports the</p><p>transport of MPEG-2-TS
    and ATM between NIU and STU. Clause 9 concerns the STU dataport interface and</p><p>specifies
    the physical interfaces used to connect an STB to various peripheral devices.
    It defines normative STU</p><p>multimedia dataport tools and interfaces and also
    includes informative specifications for both PC and parallel</p><p>dataports.
    These interfaces support the transport of MPEG-2-TS or IP. Clause 10 defines the
    physical interfaces</p><p>for interconnections between cascaded SPS entities with
    or without an intervening core network and the physical</p><p>interfaces for networks
    used to connect various hosts within an SPS.</p>"
