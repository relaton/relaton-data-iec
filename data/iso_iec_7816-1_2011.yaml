abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-1:2011 specifies the physical characteristics of integrated
    circuit cards with contacts. It applies to identification cards of the ID-1 card
    type, which can include embossing and/or a magnetic stripe and/or tactile identifier
    mark as specified in ISO/IEC 7811. Test methods are specified in ISO/IEC 10373-1.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    7816-1:2011 applies to cards which have a physical interface with electrical contacts.
    It does not, however, define the nature, number and position of the integrated
    circuits in the cards.</p>"
