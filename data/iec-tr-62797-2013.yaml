  content: IEC/TR 62797:2013(E) provides the results of an international comparison
    of measurements of the magnetic moment, using vibrating sample magnetometers (VSM)
    and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers. The basic
    object of this comparison is to verify the degree of reproducibility of the method
    employed as a prerequisite for the prospective development of a related IEC measuring
    standard.
