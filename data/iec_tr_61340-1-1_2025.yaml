abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61340-1-1:2025 gives guidance on error consideration and uncertainty
    estimation in electrostatics and ESD control measurements. It provides guidance
    on minimizing measurement errors and estimating measurement uncertainties using
    practical methods. The document also outlines how measurement results can be expressed
    in a test report. It is important to note that this document serves as an informative
    guideline intended for individuals who already have a solid understanding of the
    basics of electrostatics theory and measurement techniques.
