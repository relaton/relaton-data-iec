abstract:
- content: This technical report covers the routine testing of radionuclide calibrators
    used in nuclear medicine. Such devices utilise ionization chambers of the well
    type (directly coupled to an appropriate electronic circuitry (IEC 61145)) and
    a direct readout in units of ACTIVITY. Requirements and specific methods to determine
    performance parameters are described in IEC 61303 and IEC 61145. These methods
    are primarily designed for acceptance testing.
