abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-3:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to hand-held grinders, disc-type
    polishers and disc-type sanders, including angle, straight and vertical tools,
    intended for use on various materials except magnesium, with a rated capacity
    not exceeding 230 mm. For grinders, the rated no-load speed does not exceed a
    peripheral speed of the accessory of 80 m/s at rated capacity.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to dedicated cut-off machines.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to orbital polishers and orbital sanders.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to die grinders.<br />\r\nThis Part 2-3 is to be used in conjunction with
    the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014.<br />\r\nThe attention of National Committees
    is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may
    need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.<br />\r\nIt is the
    recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted
    for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.
    The contents of the corrigendum of April 2021 have been included in this copy."
