  content: "IEC TS 62749:2020 specifies the expected characteristics of electricity
    at the SUPPLY TERMINALS of public low, medium and high voltage, 50 Hz or 60 Hz,
    networks.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The boundaries between the various voltage levels can
    be different for different countries/regions. In the context of this TS, the following
    terms for system voltage are used:<br />\r\n- low voltage (LV) refers to less
    than or equal to 1 kV;<br />\r\n- medium voltage (MV) refers to between 1 kV and
    35 kV;<br />\r\n- high voltage (HV) refers to between 35 kV and 230 kV.<br />\r\nWhile
    power quality is related to EMC in a number of ways this document is not an EMC
    publication. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) minimum number of remaining data for weekly analysis,<br />\r\nb) improvement
    of the compatibility between EN 50160 and IEC TS 62749,<br />\r\nc) further explanation
    of the conception of daily sliding window,<br />\r\nd) further explanation of
    the aggregation method used for events,<br />\r\ne) further explanation of the
    relation between Power Quality and EMC,<br />\r\nf) addition of a new definition
    of mains communicating system (MCS),<br />\r\ng) addition of a new Annex G: Other
    phenomena,<br />\r\nh) transfer of the main content of IEC TR 62510 to IEC TS
    62749."
