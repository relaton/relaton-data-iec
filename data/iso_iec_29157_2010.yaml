abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29157:2010 specifies the physical layer (PHY) characteristics and
    medium access control (MAC) procedures used for short-range, low-data-rate, wireless
    communications with very low latency and point-to-multipoint connection capability
    in the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band.
