abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-4:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-4:2023
    deals with the safety of:<br />\r\n- stand-alone electric spin extractors, and<br
    />\r\n- spin extractors incorporated in washing machines that have separate containers
    for washing and spin extraction<br />\r\nfor household and similar purposes that
    have a capacity not exceeding 10 kg of dry cloth and a drum peripheral speed not
    exceeding 50 m/s, their rated voltages being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied
    appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as spin extractors intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry
    and on farms and spin extractors for communal use in blocks of flats or in launderettes,
    are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the reasonably foreseeable hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances intended
    exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used
    in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis eighth edition cancels
    and replaces the seventh edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text (20.103, 20.104, 22.101);<br
    />\r\nc) addition of test probe 19 for accessibility of live parts and moving
    parts (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nd) addition of accessible surface temperature limits
    (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ne) specified operating conditions for battery operated
    appliances (B.11.1).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the
    latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
