  content: IEC TR 62357-200:2015(E) applies to information exchange in power systems
    including, but not restricted to, substations, control centre, maintenance centre,
    energy management systems, synchrophasor-based grid stability systems, bulk energy
    generation, distributed energy generation (renewables), energy storage, load management.
    It addresses the issues encountered when migrating from Internet Protocol version
    4 (IPv4) to Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). It describes migration strategies,
    covering impact on applications, communication stack, network nodes, configuration,
    address allocation, cyber security and the related management. This Technical
    Report considers backward compatibility and show concepts as well as necessary
    migration paths to IPv6 from IPv4 where necessary, for a number of protocols in
    the IEC 61850 framework.
