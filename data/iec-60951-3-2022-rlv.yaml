  content: "IEC 60951-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60951-3:2022 provides
    general guidance on the design principles and performance criteria for equipment
    for continuous high range area gamma monitoring in nuclear facilities for accident
    and post-accident conditions. This document categorizes accident conditions into
    design basis accidents (DBA) and design extension conditions (DEC), including
    severe accident (SA). The purpose of this document is to lay down general requirements
    for equipment for continuous high range area gamma monitoring of radiation within
    the facility during and after accident conditions in nuclear facilities. This
    document is applicable to installed dose rate meters that are used to monitor
    high levels of gamma radiation during and after an accident. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009.The main technical changes
    with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- Title modified.<br
    />\r\n- To be consistent with the categorization of the accident condition.<br
    />\r\n- To update the references to new standards published since the second edition.<br
    />\r\n- To update the terms and definitions.<br />\r\nThis standard is to be read
    in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4029\">IEC 60951-1</a>.</p>"
