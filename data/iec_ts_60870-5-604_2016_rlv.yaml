abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60870-5-604:2016(E) RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC TS 60870-5-604:2016(E)
    describes test cases for conformance testing of telecontrol equipment, Substation
    Automation Systems (SAS) and telecontrol systems, including front-end functions
    of SCADA, using the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard and IEC 60870-5-6, Guidelines
    for conformance testing for the IEC 60870-5 companion standards. The use of this
    part of IEC 60870 facilitates interoperability by providing a standard method
    of testing protocol implementations. This new edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- resolution
    of ambiguities;<br />\r\n- refinement of some test cases to enhance operability
    between tested devices;<br />\r\n- addition of some test cases (mainly negative
    test cases)."
