abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13818-4:2004 specifies how tests can be designed to verify
    whether coded data and decoders meet requirements specified in parts 1, 2, 3 and
    7 of ISO/IEC 13818.</p><p>Characteristics of coded data and decoders are defined
    for parts 1, 2, 3 and 7 of ISO/IEC 13818. The capabilities of a decoder specify
    which coded data the decoder can decode and reconstruct, by defining the subset
    of the standard that may be exploited in the coded data. Coded data can be decoded
    by a decoder if the characteristics of the coded data are within the subset of
    the standard specified by the decoder capabilities.</p><p>Procedures are described
    for testing conformance of coded data and decoders to the requirements defined
    in parts 1, 2, 3 and 7 of ISO/IEC 13818. Given the set of characteristics claimed,
    the requirements that must be met are fully determined by parts 1, 2, 3 and 7
    of ISO/IEC 13818. ISO/IEC 13818-4:2004 summarizes the requirements, cross references
    them to characteristics, and defines how conformance with them can be tested.</p><p>A
    set of conformance test sequences implemented according to those guidelines are
    provided as an electronic annex to ISO/IEC 13818-4:2004.</p>"
