abstract:
- content: "IEC 62236-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62236-4:2018
    specifies limits for emission and immunity and provides performance criteria for
    signalling and telecommunications (S&T) apparatus (including power supply systems
    belonging to S&T) which may interfere with other apparatus inside the railway
    environment, or increase the total emissions for the railway environment and so
    risk causing electromagnetic interference to apparatus outside the railway system.
    This new edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition: clarification of certain parts of the standard; extension
    of emission and immunity requirements."
