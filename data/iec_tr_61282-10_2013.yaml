abstract:
- content: 'IEC/TR 61282-10:2013(E) defines the error vector magnitude (EVM) as a
    metric for quantifying the quality of an optical vector-modulated (modulation
    of phase and possibly magnitude) signal from a transmitter or optical transmission
    link. The considerations required for reproducible measurement results are detailed.
    The relationships with other related parameters from constellation diagram analysis
    like error vector, phase error, magnitude error, I-Q offset and time-resolved
    EVM are described, as well as the relationship between EVM and Q-factor. Key words:
    error vector magnitude (EVM), quality of an optical vector-modulated signal The
    contents of the corrigendum of April 2013 have been included in this copy.'
