abstract:
- content: IEC 62595-2-5:2021 specifies the measurement methods for measuring the
    optical characteristics of convex and concave cylindrical light sources. These
    non-planar light sources (NPLSs) can have either a continuous, distinct, segmented
    or block-wised light radiating surface, for example OLED panels, integrated LEDs,
    integrated mini-LEDs, micro-LEDs, laser diodes, each being either monochromatic
    or polychromatic.
