  content: "IEC 62908-12-10:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62908-12-10:2025
    specifies the standard measuring conditions and measurement methods for determining
    touch and hovering performance of a touch sensor module. This document is applicable
    to touch sensor modules, whereas the structural relationship between touch sensor,
    touch controller, touch sensor module, display panel, touch display panel, and
    touch display module is defined in IEC 62908-1-2. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2023. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added principle of force sensitive
    touch sensor module and force-output characteristics measurement;<br />\r\nb)
    added required equipment for force-output characteristic measurement of force
    sensitive touch sensor module;<br />\r\nc) added test method for force-output
    characteristics measurement."
