abstract:
- content: "CISPR TR 31: 2024, which is a Technical Report, covers the rationale behind
    the database containing the characteristics of radio services. The database is
    a \"living document \" in the format of a spreadsheet file in the EMC Zone of
    the IEC web site: https://www.iec.ch/emc/radio-services-database. As new input
    for the IEC Radio Services Database arrives, this Technical Report provides guidance
    and support for the systematic collation of data on those radio services which
    are relevant for determination of CISPR limits according to CISPR TR 16-4-4. All
    interested parties are invited to contribute with relevant data to the database,
    e.g., via the National Committees represented in CISPR/H. The objective of the
    database is to register those characteristics which are relevant for derivation
    and specification of limits for disturbances from electric and/or electronic equipment,
    systems and installations. Committees responsible for generic and/or product emission
    EMC standards use this information together with CISPR TR 16-4-4.<br />\r\nThis
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    A new Clause 3 covers a line of essential definitions of radio parameters, the
    knowledge of which is necessary to get qualified input data for inclusion of essential
    requirements in the present radio services database (RSD) maintained by CISPR
    and IEC.<br />\r\nb) The radio parameters and conditions of use of radio receivers
    listed in Table 1 of this edition of CISPR TR 31 are provided now with instructive
    advice in its new Subclauses 5.1 and 5.2, on selection of data for input to the
    RSD and retrieval of that data for consideration and use with the limits setting
    model as in CISPR TR 16-4-4 which was missing in the previous edition of CISPR
    TR 31.<br />\r\nc) Finally, another new informative Annex B informs, to the extent
    necessary, on the principles of ITU-R on determination of data for the minimum
    usable field strength (to be inserted in Column (E) of the RSD) and of the associated
    tolerable disturbance at the antenna of the radio reception system or other self-contained
    radio receiver (also to be used as input with the limits-setting model in CISPR
    TR 16-4-4), which concerns only parties who are concerned with designing and projecting
    of radio-communication/broadcast networks and with coverage planning of related
    radio services. Knowledge of these fundamental principles also by CISPR experts
    will ensure that only valid data will get future input to the RSD maintained by
    CISPR and IEC."
