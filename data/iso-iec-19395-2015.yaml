  content: <p>ISO/IEC 19395:2015 provides Messages that facilitate integrated or "smart"
    monitoring and control of Resources in those islands. The Messages are exchanged
    between the Management Function and Resources. ISO/IEC 19395:2015 acknowledges
    that those Resources may be composed of other Resources (e.g. a rack may contain
    servers, ventilators, etc.). In addition, e.g. those servers may be viewed from
    their computing, energy consumption or dissipation aspects which ISO/IEC 19395:2015
    models as Resource Components and groups into IT, power and fluid Domains, respectively.</p>
