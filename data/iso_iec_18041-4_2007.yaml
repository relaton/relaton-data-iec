abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18041-4:2007 specifies the binding of the application programming
    interface (API) defined in ISO/IEC 18025 to the C programming language.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) is a mapping between
    data and meaning. Data in a system may need to be identified as to purpose, metric
    and usage. This specification defines a standard set of terms for providing this
    information. ISO/IEC 18041-4:2007 defines a standard binding for the C computer
    programming language."
