abstract:
- content: "IEC 60626-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60626-1:2023
    contains the definitions related to and the general requirements to be fulfilled
    by combined flexible materials for electrical insulation. This document does not
    include mica papers used as a primary component, which are covered by the IEC
    60371 series, but insulation materials based on mica paper can be used as component
    of a combined flexible material. Materials which conform to this specification
    meet established levels of performance. However, the selection of material by
    a user for a specific application is based on the actual requirements necessary
    for adequate performance in that application and not based on this specification
    alone. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the materials available for use within this series of standards have
    been updated;<br />\r\nb) a framework has been created to allow test methods beyond
    those used for quality control specifications to allow for testing for qualification
    purposes."
