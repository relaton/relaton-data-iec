abstract:
- content: "This document defines how to use the RFID air interface standards of the
    ISO/IEC 18000 series that are based on backscatter technology for localization
    of RFID tags, specifically tags which are ISO/IEC 18000‑4, ISO/IEC 18000‑61, ISO/IEC
    18000-62, ISO/IEC 18000-63 and ISO/IEC 18000-64 compliant.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies the physical and logical requirements for localization. The system comprises
    interrogators, also known as readers, and tags, also known as labels. An interrogator
    receives information from a tag by transmitting a modulated RF signal to the tag
    and the tag responds by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna,
    thereby backscattering an information signal to the interrogator. The modulated
    RF signal for data exchange is based on the relevant part of the ISO/IEC 18000
    series and, in addition, there is a superimposed modulated RF signal with the
    same or different carrier frequency intended for localization. This document describes
    the signals required for localization, the method to derive localization information
    from the signals received by the interrogator and the requirements onto tags and
    interrogators."
