abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document defines how to use
    the RFID air interface standards of the ISO/IEC 18000 series that are based on
    backscatter technology for localization of RFID tags, specifically tags which
    are ISO/IEC 18000‑4, ISO/IEC 18000‑61, ISO/IEC 18000-62, ISO/IEC 18000-63 and
    ISO/IEC 18000-64 compliant.</p><p>This document specifies the physical and logical
    requirements for localization. The system comprises interrogators, also known
    as readers, and tags, also known as labels. An interrogator receives information
    from a tag by transmitting a modulated RF signal to the tag and the tag responds
    by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering
    an information signal to the interrogator. The modulated RF signal for data exchange
    is based on the relevant part of the ISO/IEC 18000 series and, in addition, there
    is a superimposed modulated RF signal with the same or different carrier frequency
    intended for localization. This document describes the signals required for localization,
    the method to derive localization information from the signals received by the
    interrogator and the requirements onto tags and interrogators.</p>
