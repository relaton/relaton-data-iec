    Covers minimum requirements for ventilated and electrically heated single-chamber ovens, with or without forced gas circulation, for thermal endurance evaluation of electrical insulation. It covers ovens designed to operate over all or part of the temperature range from 20 °C above ambient to 500 °C. It gives acceptance tests and in-service monitoring tests for these ageing ovens.

    The main changes with regard to the previous edition is that this edition adapts IEC 60216-4-1 to the technical content and the editorial form of IEC 60216-4-2 and IEC 60216-4-3. In addition, errors and omissions in the third edition have been corrected.
