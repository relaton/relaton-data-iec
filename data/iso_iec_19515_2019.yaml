    1.1 Purpose<p>This International Standard defines a method for automating the counting of Function Points that is generally consistent with the Function Point Counting Practices Manual, Release 4.3.1 (IFPUG CPM) produced by the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG). Guidelines in this International Standard may differ from those in the IFPUG CPM at points where subjective judgments have to be replaced by the rules needed for automation. The IFPUG CPM was selected as the anchor for this International Standard because it is the most widely used functional measurement specification with a large supporting infrastructure maintained by a professional organization.</p>
    1.2 Applicability<p>This International Standard is applicable to the functional sizing of transaction-oriented software applications, and in particular those with data persistency. To be consistent with the IFPUG CPM, the International Standard provides details on the support of applications using relational databases. However, the International Standard can be used and extended for any type of transactional application with data persistency.</p>
    1.3 Limitations<p>This International Standard does not address the sizing of enhancements to an application or maintained functionality (often called Enhancement Function Points). Extensions of the automated counting methods described in this International Standard such as Automated Enhancement Function Points will be addressed in future addendums to this International Standard. This International Standard does not address sizing for the non-functional components of a software application. Non-functional components (as defined by IFPUG) include:</p><p>— Structural Quality Constraints Reliability, Security, Performance Efficiency, Maintainability, etc.</p><p>— Organizational Constraints locations for operations, target hardware, compliance to standards, etc.</p><p>— Environmental Constraints interoperability, security, privacy, safety, etc.</p><p>— Implementation Constraints development language, delivery schedule, etc.</p>
