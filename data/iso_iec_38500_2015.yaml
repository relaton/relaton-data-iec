abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 38500:2015 provides guiding principles for members of governing
    bodies of organizations (which can comprise owners, directors, partners, executive
    managers, or similar) on the effective, efficient, and acceptable use of information
    technology (IT) within their organizations. It also provides guidance to those
    advising, informing, or assisting governing bodies. They include the following:<br
    />\r\n- executive managers;<br />\r\n- members of groups monitoring the resources
    within the organization;<br />\r\n- external business or technical specialists,
    such as legal or accounting specialists, retail or industrial associations, or
    professional bodies;<br />\r\n- internal and external service providers (including
    consultants);<br />\r\n- auditors. ISO/IEC 38500:2015 applies to the governance
    of the organization's current and future use of IT including management processes
    and decisions related to the current and future use of IT. These processes can
    be controlled by IT specialists within the organization, external service providers,
    or business units within the organization. ISO/IEC 38500:2015 defines the governance
    of IT as a subset or domain of organizational governance, or in the case of a
    corporation, corporate governance. ISO/IEC 38500:2015 is applicable to all organizations,
    including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit
    organizations. ISO/IEC 38500:2015 is applicable to organizations of all sizes
    from the smallest to the largest, regardless of the extent of their use of IT.
    The purpose of ISO/IEC 38500:20015 is to promote effective, efficient, and acceptable
    use of IT in all organizations by<br />\r\n- assuring stakeholders that, if the
    principles and practices proposed by the standard are followed, they can have
    confidence in the organization's governance of IT,<br />\r\n- informing and guiding
    governing bodies in governing the use of IT in their organization, and<br />\r\n-
    establishing a vocabulary for the governance of IT."
