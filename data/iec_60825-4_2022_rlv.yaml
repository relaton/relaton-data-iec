abstract:
- content: "IEC 60825-4:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60825-4:2022
    deals with basic issues concerning laser guards, including human access, interlocking
    and labelling, and gives general guidance on the design of protective housings
    and enclosures for high-power lasers. Laser guards may also comply with standards
    for laser protective eyewear, but such compliance is not necessarily sufficient
    to satisfy the requirements of this document. This part of IEC 60825 specifies
    the requirements for laser guards, permanent and temporary (for example for service),
    that enclose the process zone of a laser processing machine, and specifications
    for proprietary laser guards. This document applies to all component parts of
    a guard including clear (visibly transmitting) screens and viewing windows, panels,
    laser curtains and walls. In addition, this document indicates<br />\r\n- how
    to assess and specify the protective properties of a laser guard, and<br />\r\n-
    how to select a laser guard."
