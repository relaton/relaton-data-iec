abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-50-4:2025 describe procedures and methods which ensure that
    wind measurements using floating wind lidar systems are carried out and reported
    consistently and according to best practice. This document does not prescribe
    the purpose or use case of the wind measurements. However, as this document forms
    part of the IEC 61400 series of standards and technical specifications, it is
    anticipated that the wind measurements will be used in relation to some form of
    wind energy testing or resource assessment.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document
    is limited to vertically profiling wind lidar devices in or on buoys.<br />\r\nThis
    document aims to be applicable to any type and make of floating wind lidar system.
    The method and requirements provided in this document are independent of the model
    and type and of the measurement principle and allow application to new types of
    floating wind lidar systems as these become available.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC
    61400 aims to describe wind measurements using floating wind lidar with sufficient
    quality for the use case of wind resource assessment. Readers of this document
    can consider other use cases that can have other specific requirements."
