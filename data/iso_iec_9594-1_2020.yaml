abstract:
- content: "This document provides the directory capabilities required by many application
    layer standards and telecommunication services. Among the capabilities which it
    provides are those of \"user-friendly naming\", whereby objects can be referred
    to by names which are suitable for citing by human users (though not all objects
    need have user-friendly names); and \"name-to-address mapping\" which allows the
    binding between objects and their locations to be dynamic. The latter capability
    allows networks, for example, to be \"self-configuring\" in the sense that addition,
    removal and the changes of object location do not affect network operation.<br
    />\r\nThe Directory is not intended to be a general-purpose database system, although
    it may be built on such systems. It is assumed, for instance, that, as is typical
    with communication directories, there is a considerably higher frequency of \"queries\"
    than of updates. The rate of updates is expected to be governed by the dynamics
    of people and organizations, rather than, for example, the dynamics of networks.
    There is also no need for instantaneous global commitment of updates; transient
    conditions, where both old and new versions of the same information are available,
    are quite acceptable.<br />\r\nIt is a characteristic of the Directory that, except
    as a consequence of differing access rights or un-propagated updates, the results
    of directory queries will not be dependent on the identity or location of the
    inquirer. This characteristic renders the Directory unsuitable for some telecommunication
    applications, for example some types of routing. For cases where the results are
    dependent on the identity of the inquirer, access to directory information and
    updates of the Directory may be denied."
