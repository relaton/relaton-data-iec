abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nSpecifies
    a general framework addressing the following six components: conformance in the
    standard itself; test requirements document (defining what shall be tested for
    a computer graphics standard); test specifications document (addressing the test
    technique and the content of each test); test method (defining the implementation
    of the test specification document, including the test software); test procedures
    (defining the application of the test software, which consists of the procedures
    to be used in conformance testing); the establishment of test services. Is applicable
    to all standards within the scope of the ISO/IEC JTC1 subcommittee responsible
    for computer graphics and image processing."
