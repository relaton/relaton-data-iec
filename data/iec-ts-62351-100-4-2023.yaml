  content: "IEC TS 62351-100-4:2023, which is a technical specification, describes
    test procedures for interoperability conformance testing of data and communication
    security for power system automation and protection systems which implement MMS,
    IEC 61850-8-1 (MMS), IEC 61850-8-2 (XMPP) or any other protocol implementing IEC
    62351-4:2018/AMD1:2020. The tests described in this document cover only E2E security
    testing and do not evaluate A-security profile implementation. Thus, citing conformance
    to this document does not imply that any particular security level has been achieved
    by the corresponding product, or by the system in which it is used.<br />\r\nThe
    goal of this document is to enable interoperability by providing a standard method
    of testing protocol implementations, but it does not guarantee the full interoperability
    of devices. It is expected that using this document during testing will minimize
    the risk of non interoperability. Additional testing and assurance measures will
    be required to verify that a particular implementation of IEC 62351-4:2018/AMD1:2020
    has correctly implemented all the security functions and that they can be assured
    to be present in the delivered products. This topic is covered in other IEC standards,
    for example IEC 62443.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document is to specify available
    common procedures and definitions for conformance and/or interoperability testing
    of IEC 62351-4:2018/AMD1:2020.<br />\r\nThis document deals mainly with cyber
    security conformance testing; therefore, other requirements, such as safety or
    EMC are not covered. These requirements are covered by other standards (if applicable)
    and the proof of compliance for these topics is done according to these standards.<br
    />\r\nT-profile testing is to be performed prior to E2E security profile testing.
    T-profile testing is described in IEC 62351-100-3 in the context of IEC 61850-8-1.
    T-profile testing for IEC 61850-8-2 is to be described in the corresponding IEC
    61850-8-2 test specification."
