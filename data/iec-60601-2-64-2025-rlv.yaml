  content: "IEC 60601-2-64:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-64:2025
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and essential performance of LIGHT ION BEAM ME EQUIPMENT,
    hereafter referred to as ME EQUIPMENT, used for treatment of patients. If a clause
    or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT only, or
    to ME SYSTEMS only, the title and content of that clause or subclause will say
    so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to ME EQUIPMENT
    and to ME SYSTEMS, as relevant.<br />\r\nThis document, with the inclusion of
    TYPE TESTS and SITE TESTS, applies respectively to the manufacturer and specified
    installation aspects of LIGHT ION BEAM ME EQUIPMENT<br />\r\n– intended for RADIOTHERAPY
    in human medical practice, including those in which the selection and DISPLAY
    of operating parameters can be controlled automatically by PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRONIC
    SUBSYSTEMS (PESS),<br />\r\n– that, in NORMAL USE, deliver a RADIATION BEAM of
    LIGHT IONS having ENERGY PER NUCLEON in the range 10 MeV/n to 500 MeV/n,<br />\r\nand<br
    />\r\n– intended to be<br />\r\n• for NORMAL USE, operated under the authority
    of appropriately licensed or QUALIFIED PERSONS by OPERATORS having the required
    skills for a particular medical application, for particular SPECIFIED clinical
    purposes maintained in accordance with the recommendations given in the INSTRUCTIONS
    FOR USE,<br />\r\n• subject to regular quality assurance performance and calibration
    checks by a QUALIFIED PERSON.<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-64:2025 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) harmonization with IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC
    60601-1:2005/AMD1:2011 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020;<br />\r\nb) harmonization
    with IEC 62667:2017 for defined terms and definitions;<br />\r\nc) address revision
    to neutrons outside the field of irradiation."
