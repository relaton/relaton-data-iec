abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62543:2011+A1:2013+A2:2017 gives general guidance on the subject
    of voltage-sourced converters used for transmission of power by high voltage direct
    current (HVDC). It describes converters that are not only voltage-sourced (containing
    a capacitive energy storage medium and where the polarity of d.c. voltage remains
    fixed) but also self-commutated, using semiconductor devices which can both be
    turned on and turned off by control action. The scope includes 2-level and 3-level
    converters with pulse-width modulation (PWM), along with multi-level converters,
    but excludes 2-level and 3-level converters operated without PWM, in square-wave
    output mode. HVDC power transmission using voltage sourced converters is known
    as "VSC transmission". The various types of circuit that can be used for VSC transmission
    are described in the report, along with their principal operational characteristics
    and typical applications. The overall aim is to provide a guide for purchasers
    to assist with the task of specifying a VSC transmission scheme. Line-commutated
    and current-sourced converters are specifically excluded from this report. This
    technical report cancels and replaces IEC/PAS 62543:2008 (Ed.1) which was published
    by IEC and CIGRÃ‰ jointly, and combined with engineering experience.<br /><strong>This
    consolidated version consists of the first edition (2011), its amendment 1 (2013)
    and its amendment 2 (2017). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong>
