  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 16326:2009 provides normative content specifications for
    project management plans covering software projects, and software-intensive system
    projects. It also provides detailed discussion and advice on applying a set of
    project processes that are common to both the software and system life cycle as
    covered by ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008) and ISO/IEC 15288:2008 (IEEE
    Std 15288-2008), respectively. The discussion and advice are intended to aid in
    the preparation of the normative content of project management plans. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    16326:2009 is the result of the harmonization of ISO/IEC TR 16326:1999 and IEEE
    Std 1058-1998.</p>"
