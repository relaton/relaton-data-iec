abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2018 series is applicable to Very Small Entities
    (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up
    to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are
    not intended to preclude or discourage their use by larger organizations than
    VSEs.</p><p>The lifecycle processes defined in the ISO/IEC 29110 series can be
    used by VSEs when using, as well as when creating and supplying, a software system.
    They can be applied at any level in a software system's structure and at any stage
    in the lifecycle. The processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not
    intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that VSEs find
    useful. This document is not intended to preclude the use of different life cycles
    such as: waterfall, iterative, incremental, evolutionary or agile.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    29110-4-1:2018 provides a profile specification for the Basic profile. The Basic
    profile applies to VSEs involved in software development. It selects ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 project management and software implementation process elements from the
    single project perspective.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2018 provides the normative
    and informative links to the subset of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.</p>"
