abstract:
- content: "This part of IEC 61788 covers a test method for the determination of the
    dc critical current of short and straight Ag- and/or Ag alloy-sheathed Bi-2212
    and Bi-2223 oxide superconductors that have a monolithic structure and a shape
    of round wire or flat or square tape containing mono- or multicores of oxides.
    \n\nThis method is intended for use with superconductors that have critical currents
    less than 500 A and n-values larger than 5. The test is carried out with and without
    an applying external magnetic field. For all tests in a magnetic field, the magnetic
    field is perpendicular to the length of the specimen. In the test of a tape specimen
    in a magnetic field, the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the wider
    tape surface (or one surface if square). The test specimen is immersed either
    in a liquid helium bath or a liquid nitrogen bath during testing. Deviations from
    this test method that are allowed for routine tests and other specific restrictions
    are given in this standard."
