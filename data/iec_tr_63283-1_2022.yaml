abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63283-1:2022(E) is to compile a comprehensive collection of base
    terminology with compatible terms that can become relevant within the scope of
    Smart Manufacturing. Most of these terms refer to existing definitions in the
    domain of industrial-process measurement, control and automation and its various
    subdomains. When multiple similar definitions exist for the exact same term in
    different standards, this document contains only the preferred definition in the
    context of Smart Manufacturing. Whenever the existing definitions are not compatible
    with other terms in this document or when the definition does not fit into the
    broader scope of Smart Manufacturing, new or modified definitions are given.
