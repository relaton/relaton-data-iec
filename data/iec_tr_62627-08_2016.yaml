abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 62627-08:2016 which is a Technical Report, describes two methods
    used to measure the blocking characteristics of adaptors with an optical power
    blocking shutter. This document focuses on singlemode fibre (SMF) and two wavelengths,
    1 310 nm and 1 550 nm. Keywords: blocking characteristics, optical power blocking
    shutter'
