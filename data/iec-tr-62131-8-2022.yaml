  content: IEC TR 62131-8:2022 reviews available dynamic data relating to the transportation
    of electrotechnical equipment by marine craft such as ships and boats either at
    sea or during riverine use. In this instance, there is a clear similarity between
    dynamic data relating to the transportation of electrotechnical equipment and
    that of electrotechnical equipment installed on maritime platforms.
