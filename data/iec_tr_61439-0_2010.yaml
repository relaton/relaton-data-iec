    IEC/TR 61439-0:2010(E) Within the IEC 61439 series of standards for low-voltage switchgear and controlgear assemblies (ASSEMBLIES), there are system and application details that need to be specified by the user to enable the manufacturer to produce an ASSEMBLY that meets the needs and expectations of the user. IEC/TR 61439-0:2010(E) identifies, from the user's perspective, those functions and characteristics that should be defined when specifying ASSEMBLIES. It provides:<br />
    - an explanation of the ASSEMBLY characteristics and options within the IEC 61439 series;<br />
    - a guidance on how to select the appropriate option and to define characteristics so as to meet specific application needs, using a functional approach; and<br />
    - an assistance in the specification of ASSEMBLIES.
