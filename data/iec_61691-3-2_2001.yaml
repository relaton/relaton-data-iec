abstract:
- content: This set of packages provides a standard for the declaration of most frequently
    used real and complex elementary functions required for numerically oriented modeling
    applications. Use of these packages with their defined data types, constants,
    and functions is intended to provide a mechanism for writing VHDL models (compliant
    with IEEE Std 1076-1993) that are portable and interoperable with other VHDL models
    adhering to this standard. The standard serves a broad class of applications with
    reasonable ease of use and requires implementations that are of high quality.
    This standard includes package bodies, as described in annex B, which are available
    in electronic format either on a diskette affixed to the back cover, or as a downloadable
    file from the IEC Web Store.
