abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23000-11:2009 specifies a file format which is capable of storage,
    interchange, management, editing, and presentation of stereoscopic video contents
    based on the ISO base media file format.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23000-11:2009 specifies
    the following:</p>\n\nthe file type brand for stereoscopic video contents;\nfour
    stereoscopic video contents composition types, which are widely used and suitable
    for the 3D mobile display; \nthe file structure, which is capable of storage with
    a single video track or two video tracks for stereoscopic contents;\nthe stereoscopic
    video media information, which includes the visual type information of signaling
    stereoscopic content composition types, and the stereo_mono_change information
    for the identification of each fragment in stereo-monoscopic mixed contents;\nthe
    stereoscopic camera and display information, which provides camera, display and
    visual safety information for stereoscopic contents;\nthe track reference type,
    which tells the track of indicating primary and secondary view sequences in case
    of using two video tracks for stereoscopic contents;\nthe item location, which
    provides a location of stereoscopic fragments in stereoscopic video contents.<p>ISO/IEC
    23000-11:2009 provides the overall structure for storing pure stereoscopic video
    contents and also stereo-monoscopic mixed contents with the stereoscopic-related
    information in mobile environments.</p>"
