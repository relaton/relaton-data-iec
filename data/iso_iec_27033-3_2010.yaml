abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 27033-3:2010 describes the threats, design techniques and control
    issues associated with reference network scenarios. For each scenario, it provides
    detailed guidance on the security threats and the security design techniques and
    controls required to mitigate the associated risks. Where relevant, it includes
    references to ISO/IEC 27033-4 to ISO/IEC 27033-6 to avoid duplicating the content
    of those documents.The information in ISO/IEC 27033-3:2010 is for use when reviewing
    technical security architecture/design options and when selecting and documenting
    the preferred technical security architecture/design and related security controls,
    in accordance with ISO/IEC 27033-2. The particular information selected (together
    with information selected from ISO/IEC 27033-4 to ISO/IEC 27033-6) will depend
    on the characteristics of the network environment under review, i.e. the particular
    network scenario(s) and â€˜technology' topic(s) concerned.Overall, ISO/IEC 27033-3:2010
    will aid considerably the comprehensive definition and implementation of security
    for any organization's network environment.
