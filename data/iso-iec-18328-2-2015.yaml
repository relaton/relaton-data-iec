    <p>ISO/IEC 18328-2:2015 defines physical characteristics and test methods for cards with devices, including but not limited to power supplying devices, displays, sensors, microphones, loudspeakers, buttons or keypads. This part of ISO/IEC 18328 also covers aspects of coexistence of technologies of devices on the card and other machine readable card technologies.</p>
    <p>Additional requirements related to biometric capture devices are defined in ISO/IEC 17839‑2. Such requirements may be applied in addition to the ones defined in this part of ISO/IEC 18328.</p>
