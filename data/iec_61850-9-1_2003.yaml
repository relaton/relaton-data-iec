abstract:
- content: Lays down the specific communication service mappings for the communication
    between bay and process level; specifies a mapping on a serial unidirectional
    multidrop point to point link in accordance with IEC 60044-8. Applies to the communication
    between merging units of electronic current or voltage-transformers and bay devices
    such as protection relays.<br /><br />This publication is of core relevance for
