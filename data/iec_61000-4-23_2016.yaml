abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-4-23:2016(E) provides a protective devices test method for HEMP
    and other radiated disturbances. It is primarily intended for HEMP testing but
    can be applied to other externally generated radiated disturbances where appropriate.
    It provides a brief description of the most important concepts for testing of
    shielding elements. For each test, the following basic information is provided:<br
    />\r\n- theoretical foundation of the test (the test concepts);<br />\r\n- test
    set-up including outside-to-in and inside-to-out measurements;<br />\r\n- required
    equipment;<br />\r\n- test procedures;<br />\r\n- data processing.<br />\r\nThis
    international standard does not provide information on requirements for specific
    levels for testing. Due to the available space, a transmitting antenna position
    outside the barrier has mainly been suggested. However, nowadays, many EMP protection
    facilities in practical use do not actually have enough space available outside
    the electromagnetic barrier due to physical constraints such as concrete walls
    or soil to allow the method described in IEC 61000-4-23:2000 (edition 1) to be
    applied correctly. From experience many facilities have available space for a
    1 m separation or less only. Therefore, in many practical cases it is not possible
    to measure shielding effectiveness according to the test method of previous documents.
    The constructors for EMP protection facilities are also unwilling to build facilities
    with extra space for measurements with the transmitting antenna outside the barrier
    due to the great expense and inefficiency of the operational working area for
    new or existing buildings. This document provides additionally a method that allows
    the transmitting antenna to be placed inside the enclosure and the receiving antenna
    outside the barrier ('inside-to-out' method). Annex F includes test set-up and
    procedure examples. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2000. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) updates to the shielding effectiveness (SE) test method in
    Clause 5;<br />\r\nb) a new Annex F describing methods for testing 'inside-to-out'
    has been added."
