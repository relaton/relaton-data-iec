  content: IEC 62906-5-5:2022 specifies the standard measurement conditions and optical
    measuring methods for raster-scanning retina direct projection laser displays
    with light sources such as direct-emitting lasers, optionally equipped with higher-order
    harmonic generation devices. The hybrid light sources using both lasers and spontaneous-emission-based
    light sources are not considered.
