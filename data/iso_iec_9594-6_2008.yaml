abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594-6:2008 defines a number of attribute types and matching
    rules which may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory.</p><p>Attribute
    types and matching rules fall into the following three categories:</p><ul><li>Some
    attribute types and matching rules are used by a wide variety of applications
    or are understood and/or used by the Directory itself. (It is recommended that
    an attribute type or matching rule defined in ISO/IEC 9594-6:2008 be used, in
    preference to the generation of a new one, whenever it is appropriate for the
    application.)</li><li>Some attribute types and matching rules are internationally
    standardized, but are application-specific. These are defined in the standards
    associated with the application concerned.</li><li>Any administrative authority
    can define its own attribute types and matching rules for any purpose. These are
    not internationally standardized, and are available to others beyond the administrative
    authority which created them only by bilateral agreement.</li></ul>"
