abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO
    19678:2015 provides requirements and guidelines for preventing the unauthorized
    modification of Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) firmware on PC client systems.
    Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by malicious software constitutes a
    significant threat because of the BIOS's unique and privileged position within
    the PC architecture. A malicious BIOS modification could be part of a sophisticated,
    targeted attack on an organization?either a permanent denial of service (if the
    BIOS is corrupted) or a persistent malware presence (if the BIOS is implanted
    with malware). As used in this publication, the term BIOS refers to conventional
    BIOS, Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) BIOS, and Unified Extensible Firmware
    Interface (UEFI) BIOS. This International Standard applies to system BIOS firmware
    (e.g., conventional BIOS or UEFI BIOS) stored in the system flash memory of computer
    systems, including portions that may be formatted as Option ROMs. However, it
    does not apply to Option ROMs, UEFI drivers, and firmware stored elsewhere in
    a computer system. Subclause 7.2 provides platform vendors with requirements for
    a secure BIOS update process. Additionally, subclause 7.3 provides guidelines
    for managing the BIOS in an operational environment. While this International
    Standard focuses on current and future x86 and x64 client platforms, the controls
    and procedures are independent of any particular system design."
