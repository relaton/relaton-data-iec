abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO 19678:2015 provides requirements and guidelines for preventing
    the unauthorized modification of<em>Basic Input/Output System (BIOS)</em> firmware
    on PC client systems. Unauthorized modification of BIOS firmware by malicious
    software constitutes a significant threat because of the BIOS's unique and privileged
    position within the PC architecture. A malicious BIOS modification could be part
    of a sophisticated, targeted attack on an organization?either a permanent denial
    of service (if the BIOS is corrupted) or a persistent malware presence (if the
    BIOS is implanted with malware).</p><p>As used in this publication, the term BIOS
    refers to conventional BIOS,<em>Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)</em> BIOS,
    and<em>Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI)</em>BIOS<em>.</em> This International
    Standard applies to system BIOS firmware (e.g., conventional BIOS or UEFI BIOS)
    stored in the system flash memory of computer systems, including portions that
    may be formatted as Option ROMs. However, it does not apply to Option ROMs, UEFI
    drivers, and firmware stored elsewhere in a computer system.</p><p>Subclause 7.2
    provides platform vendors with requirements for a secure BIOS update process.
    Additionally, subclause 7.3 provides guidelines for managing the BIOS in an operational
    environment.</p><p>While this International Standard focuses on current and future
    x86 and x64 client platforms, the controls and procedures are independent of any
    particular system design.</p>"
