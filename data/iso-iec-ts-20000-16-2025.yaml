    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document provides guidance for including sustainability within a service management system (SMS) based on the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 20000-1. It is aimed at:</span></p>
    <p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-bidi-font-family: Cambria;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">—<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">     </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">organizations that are intending to implement the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1 and directly address sustainability;</span></p>

    <p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if !supportLists]--><span lang="EN-GB" style="mso-fareast-font-family: Cambria; mso-bidi-font-family: Cambria;"><span style="mso-list: Ignore;">—<span style="font: 7.0pt 'Times New Roman';">     </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span lang="EN-GB">consultants, trainers and other experts supporting organizations that utilize ISO/IEC 20000-1, so that they can be informed on how to include sustainability actions in an SMS.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Sustainability in this context has three interdependent dimensions, which are environmental, social and economic. Annex A expands on the three dimensions with examples of each.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The guidance provided in this document aims to help organizations consider and address sustainability objectives as well as challenges related to their services. The complexity and detail surrounding the inclusion of sustainability within an SMS will vary and be dependent on the context of the organization, the scope of the SMS, compliance obligations and the nature of the services within the scope of the SMS.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 20000-1 to address sustainability objectives related to specific requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1. As such, it is anticipated that the user of this document is aware of the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1. The suggestions included across clauses in this document will be most effective when applied to an SMS which is implemented according to the corresponding clauses in ISO/IEC 20000-1. Application of this guidance to an SMS according to ISO/IEC 20000-1 is therefore recommended.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document supports and is an addition to the guidance already provided in ISO/IEC 20000-2, ISO/IEC 20000-3, ISO/IEC TS 20000-5 and other parts of the ISO/IEC 20000 series.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Organizations can use the guidance in this document to also address the new requirements identified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018/Amd 1:2024 and ISO’s objectives to address climate change.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The recommendations in this document for improving sustainability within an SMS are not exclusive and can be implemented along with other sustainability initiatives.</span></p>
