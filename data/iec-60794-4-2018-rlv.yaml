  content: "IEC 60794-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-4:2018
    covers cable construction, test methods, optical, mechanical, environmental and
    electrical performance requirements for aerial optical fibre cables and cable
    elements which are intended to be used along power lines (OCEPL) as a high bandwidth
    transport media for communications and control optical signals, including optical
    ground wires (OPGW), optical phase conductors (OPPC), metallic aerial self-supported
    cables (MASS), all-dielectric self-supporting cables (ADSS) and optical attached
    cables (OPAC). This document excludes figure-8 optical cables to be used on telephone
    utility poles. The IEC TR 62839-1 gives recommendations to provide the customer
    with the environmental declaration on request. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.  This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the specification has been streamlined
    by cross-referencing IEC 60794-1-1;<br />\r\nb) the classification as type tests
    or routine tests has been deleted;<br />\r\nc) cable kink test has been deleted;<br
    />\r\nd) creep test for ADSS is referred to IEC 60794-4-20.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords:
    aerial optical fibre cables"
