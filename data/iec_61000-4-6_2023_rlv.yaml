abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-4-6:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-6:
    2023 relates to the conducted immunity requirements of electrical and electronic
    equipment to electromagnetic disturbances coming from intended radio-frequency
    (RF) transmitters in the frequency range 150 kHz up to 80 MHz.<br />\r\nNOTE 1
    Product committees might decide to use the methods described in this document
    also for frequencies up to 230 MHz (see Annex B) although the methods and test
    instrumentation are intended to be used in the frequency range up to 80 MHz.<br
    />\r\nEquipment not having at least one conducting wire or cable (such as mains
    supply, signal line or earth connection) which can couple the equipment to the
    disturbing RF fields is excluded from the scope of this document.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 Test methods are specified in this part of IEC 61000 to assess the effect that
    conducted disturbing signals, induced by electromagnetic radiation, have on the
    equipment concerned. The simulation and measurement of these conducted disturbances
    are not adequately exact for the quantitative determination of effects. The test
    methods specified are structured for the primary objective of establishing adequate
    repeatability of results at various facilities for quantitative analysis of effects.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is to establish a common reference for evaluating
    the functional immunity of electrical and electronic equipment when subjected
    to conducted disturbances induced by RF fields. The test method in this document
    describes a consistent method to assess the immunity of an equipment or system
    against a specified phenomenon.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 As described in IEC Guide 107,
    this document is a basic EMC publication for use by product committees of the
    IEC. As also stated in Guide 107, the IEC product committees are responsible for
    determining whether this immunity test standard should be applied or not, and
    if applied, they are responsible for determining the appropriate test levels and
    performance criteria.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) selection of injection devices revised;<br />\r\nb)
    need of AE impedance check for clamp injection removed and Annex H deleted;<br
    />\r\nc) saturation check revised;<br />\r\nd) new Annex H on testing with multiple
    signals;<br />\r\ne) level-setting only with feedback loop."
