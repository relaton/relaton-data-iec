abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63415:2023 provides an overview over the formalized modelling and
    designing of cybersecure architectures to apply for I&C system cybersecurity enforcement
    at NPPs. The plant-specific risk assessment can use the techniques covered by
    this TR. This document considers the complex problem of NPP I&C architecture synthesis
    to address particular issues:<br />\r\n- asset classification,<br />\r\n- barrier
    measures assignment,<br />\r\n- the information transfer and links conformity
    with security requirements.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance on creating
    a comprehensive security model applicable to NPP I&C systems that describes NPP
    I&C cybersecurity architecture and aids in accomplishing the main tasks of I&C
    system secure design, which are:<br />\r\n- specification of system designs with
    increased determinism that enhance security,<br />\r\n- mapping of the security
    requirements into the security architecture of the I&C system,<br />\r\n- definition
    of the security requirements for information exchange between components within
    the I&C system, operators and other systems,<br />\r\n- assistance in the determination
    of the security degree assignment with a model-based technique considering asset
    properties and formal grouping of the assets,<br />\r\ndesign and establishment
    of security zones boundaries."
