  content: "IEC/TR 62781:2012(E), which is a technical report, is applicable to all
    measurements of ultrasonic fields where water is the transmission medium. Water
    provides an inexpensive and readily available medium with characteristic acoustic
    impedance comparable to biological tissue. However, basic tap water is far from
    optimum for ultrasonic measurement as it contains many dissolved, absorbed and
    suspended contaminants. Measurements can be affected in many ways by these impurities.
    This technical aims to provide a unified source to establish a water treatment
    process for ultrasonic measurements. The quality and treatment methods for water
    used within a radiation force balance (RFB) may be different from that required
    for hydrophone based acoustic measurements. Chemical based methods of water treatment
    (e.g. algaecides) may be appropriate for these applications. However, in this
    document, chemical means are noted but appropriately discouraged for acoustic
    pressure/intensity measurements. This Technical Report describes methods for:<br
    />\r\n- degassing water to be used in ultrasonic measurements;<br />\r\n- to decrease
    the ionic content of water to be used in ultrasonic measurements;<br />\r\n- to
    decrease the biological content of water to be used in ultrasonic measurements;
    and<br />\r\n- to reduce the suspended particulate content of water to be used
    in ultrasonic measurements."
