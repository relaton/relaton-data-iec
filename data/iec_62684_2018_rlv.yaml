abstract:
- content: "IEC 62684:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62684:2018
    specifies the interoperability of common external power supplies for use with
    data-enabled mobile telephones. It defines the common charging capability and
    specifies interface requirements for the external power supply. Safety and EMC
    aspects are not covered by this document. Safety is covered by IEC 60950-1 or
    IEC 62368-1 and EMC is covered by regional /national standards. This document
    defines interoperability based on legacy USB technologies and does not cover charging
    interfaces that implement IEC 62680-1-3, IEC 62680-1-2 and IEC 63002. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2011. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 1 is
    modified to include updated references to IEC Universal Serial Bus interface standards;<br
    />\r\nb) Clause 2 is expanded to include references to IEC Universal Serial Bus
    interface standards;<br />\r\nc) Subclause 4.1 is expanded to include requirements
    for non USB Micro-B plug DC plug connectors;<br />\r\nd) Subclause 4.4 is modified
    to remove obsolete requirements for common mode noise and reference requirements
    of IEC Universal Serial Bus interface standards;<br />\r\ne) Subclause 4.5 is
    modified to reference appropriate safety standards."
