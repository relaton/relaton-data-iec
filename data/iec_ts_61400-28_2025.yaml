abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61400-28:2025 sets out minimum requirements for actions, investigations
    and assessments to ensure the continued structural integrity of wind farm assets,
    particularly wind turbines, aimed at verifying that they remain safe for personnel
    to operate. The document describes how to maintain those assets and collect suitable
    evidence to demonstrate to third parties that risks are minimised, particularly
    where risks are related to collateral damage or injury, such as could be suffered
    by personnel or structures neighbouring the wind farm. Covered in this document
    are assessments of current condition and remaining useful life, resulting in the
    technical basis for justifying extended operation beyond the design life (defined
    in 3.1.3) and also beyond the site-specific assessed lifetime, whichever is shorter,
    for structural or major components and systems contributing to primary layer of
    the safety system.
