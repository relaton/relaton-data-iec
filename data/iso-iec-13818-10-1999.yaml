    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 138 18 defines compliance to Data Storage Media Command and Control (DSMCC) standard in 2 steps: the static review and the dynamic review as defined in ISO/IEC 9646 Conformance Testing standard [ 1, 2, 31. The static review requirements are specified in clause 4 of this part of ISO/IEC 138 18 in the form of Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma. The ATS used for dynamic review is described in clause 5.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 138 18 does not specify all the requirements with which terminal equipment intended for use in conjunction with multimedia information retrieval services has to comply. In particular, this part of ISO/IEC 138 18 does not specify (lower layer) protocols to be used to deliver/transport DSM-CC protocol data units. Neither does it specify requirements related to safety, protection, and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of the equipment, or regulatory requirements with which such equipment may be required to comply.</p>
