abstract:
- content: 'Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This ISO&#x2F;IEC standard for FC-SW specifies tools and algorithms for interconnection
    and initialization of Fibre Channel switches to create a multi-switch Fibre Channel
    Fabric. This Standard defines an E_Port (iPExpansion Portlp) that operates in
    a manner similar to an N_Port and F_Port, as defined in ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165-111,
    with additional functionality provided for interconnecting switches. This standard
    decribes the following: - An overview of the Switched-based Fabric; - The general
    behavior for all modes of the Switch Port; - The services provided for use by
    the Switch Fabrics; - Fabric Configuration process.'
