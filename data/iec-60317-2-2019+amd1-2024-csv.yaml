  content: "IEC 60317-2:2019+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of solderable
    enamelled round copper winding wire of class 130 with a dual coating. The underlying
    coating is based on polyurethane resin, which may be modified providing it retains
    the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all specified wire requirements.
    The superimposed coating is a bonding layer based on a thermoplastic resin. NOTE
    A modified resin is a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains
    one or more additives to enhance certain performance or application characteristics.
    The range of nominal conductor diameters covered by this standard is:<br />\r\n-
    Grade 1B: 0,020 mm up to and including 2,000 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2B: 0,020 mm
    up to and including 2,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe nominal conductor diameters are specified
    in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the
    fourth edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of heat bonding test loads for nominal
    conductor diameters up to and including 0,050 mm;<br />\r\nb) addition of pin
    hole test requirements according to IEC 60317-0-1:2013.<br />\r\nKeywords: insulated
    wires used for windings"
