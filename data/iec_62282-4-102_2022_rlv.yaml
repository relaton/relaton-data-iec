abstract:
- content: "IEC 62282-4-102:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62282-4-102:2022 specifies
    the performance test methods of fuel cell power systems for propulsion and auxiliary
    power units (APU). This document covers fuel cell power systems for propulsion
    other than those for road vehicles. This document applies to gaseous hydrogen-fuelled
    fuel cell power systems and direct methanol fuel cell power systems for electrically
    powered industrial trucks. The following fuels are considered within the scope
    of this document:<br />\r\n- gaseous hydrogen, and<br />\r\n- methanol.<br />\r\nThis
    document covers the fuel cell power system as defined in 3.7 and Figure 1. This
    document applies to DC type fuel cell power systems, with a rated output voltage
    not exceeding DC 150 V for indoor and outdoor use. This document covers fuel cell
    power systems whose fuel source container is permanently attached to either the
    industrial truck or the fuel cell power system.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2017. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na.
    alignment of the Scope with the second edition of IEC 62282-4-101:2022;<br />\r\nb.
    deletion of terms and definitions (previous entries 3.5, 3.10, and 3.15);<br />\r\nc.
    addition of new terms in Clause 3: \"delivered power\" (3.13) and \"regenerated
    power\" (3.14);<br />\r\nd. revision of symbols and their meanings in alignment
    with those of IEC 62282-3-201;<br />\r\ne. replacement of \"reference conditions\"
    with \"standard conditions\" as seen in Clause 5;<br />\r\nf. revision of the
    test method for the accessory load voltage spike test (13.3.2);<br />\r\ng. addition
    of clarifications in Clause 14 (Power stability under operation);<br />\r\nh.
    addition of a checklist for performance criteria dealt with in this document (Annex
    C).</p>"
