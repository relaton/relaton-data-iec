  content: IEC 62481-8:2017(E) specifies guidelines for Diagnostics. The DLNA Diagnostics
    guidelines focus mostly on the collection of data through test actions and queries.
    The procedures for troubleshooting and remedies are outside the scope of the DLNA
    guidelines. The user can be an operator accessing the Diagnostics Application
    through a TR-069 (an application layer protocol for remote management of end-user
    devices) management interface, or a technician or end-user accessing it through
    a browser or screen interface as shown in Figure 1.
