abstract:
- content: ISO 7498-2:1989 provides a general description of security services and
    related mechanisms, which can be ensured by the Reference Model, and of the positions
    within the Reference Model where the services and mechanisms may be provided.
    Extends the field of application of ISO 7498 to cover secure communications between
    open systems. Adds to the concepts and principles included in ISO 7498 but does
    not modify them. Is no implementation specification, nor a basis for assessing
    the conformance of actual implementations.
