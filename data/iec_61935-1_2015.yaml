abstract:
- content: "IEC 61935-1:2015(E) specifies reference measurement procedures for cabling
    parameters and the requirements for field tester accuracy to measure cabling parameters
    identified in ISO/IEC 11801. References in this standard to ISO/IEC 11801 mean
    ISO/IEC 11801 or equivalent cabling standards. This International Standard applies
    when the cable assemblies are constructed of cables complying with the IEC 61156
    family of standards, and connecting hardware as specified in the IEC 60603-7 family
    of standards or IEC 61076-3-104, IEC 61076-3-110, IEC 61076-2-101 and IEC 61076-2-109.
    Where cables and/or connectors do not comply with these standards, then additional
    tests may be required. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the upper frequency
    goes up to 1 000 MHz;<br />\r\nb) test methods are now included for exogenous
    (alien) crosstalk;<br />\r\nc) a new Annex A has been added for uncertainty and
    variability of field test results."
