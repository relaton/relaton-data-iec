abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 specifies a series of extensions to the standard
    library for the programming language C++, as specified by ISO/IEC 14882, in order
    to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded C++ standard library.
    Some of the components in ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 could be considered for standardization
    in a future version of C++.  The specific classes of extensions specified in ISO/IEC
    TR 19768:2007 are as follows:    general utilities such as reference-counted pointers;   functional
    programming;   facilities for compile-time type queries;   enhanced support for
    numerical computation;   hash tables and other additional container classes;   regular
    expression processing;    improved capability with the programming language C,
    as specified by ISO/IEC 9899.'
