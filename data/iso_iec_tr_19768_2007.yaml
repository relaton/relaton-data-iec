abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 specifies a series of extensions to the standard
    library for the programming language C++, as specified by ISO/IEC 14882, in order
    to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded C++ standard library.
    Some of the components in ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 could be considered for standardization
    in a future version of C++.<br /><br />\r\nThe specific classes of extensions
    specified in ISO/IEC TR 19768:2007 are as follows:<br /><br />\r\ngeneral utilities
    such as reference-counted pointers;<br />\r\nfunctional programming;<br />\r\nfacilities
    for compile-time type queries;<br />\r\nenhanced support for numerical computation;<br
    />\r\nhash tables and other additional container classes;<br />\r\nregular expression
    processing;<br />\r\nimproved capability with the programming language C, as specified
    by ISO/IEC 9899."
