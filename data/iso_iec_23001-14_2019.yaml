abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23001-14:2019 This document specifies the partial file format,
    which is a generic format for describing file partially received over lossy communication
    channels. This format contains the correctly received data, missing block identification,
    and repair information such as location of the file or high-level original indexing
    information. This format can be used with any file formats, and provides additional
    helper tools for formats deriving from ISO/IEC 14496-12.
