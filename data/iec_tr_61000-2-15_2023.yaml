abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-2-15: 2023 which is a Technical Report, addresses in particular
    the following main phenomena, which affect the power quality in modern distribution
    systems with high penetration of power electronics converters. As some aspects
    of the subject have already been addressed in the past, considering the evolution
    of the LV and MV networks, this document focuses on the following aspects:\r\nresonances
    in the network, modelling and on-site validation;\r\nsupraharmonics and measurements
    issues;\r\nimpact of increased number of power electronic converters;\r\nstability
    and instability issues for the equipment to be connected\r\nThe target phenomena
    and conditions of this document are the following:\r\nfrequency: ≤ 2 kHz, 2 kHz
    to 9 kHz, ≥ 9 kHz;\r\nvoltage levels: LV, MV;\r\nharmonic sources: all types of
    converters (EV battery chargers, appliances, etc.…).\r\nSome of these frequency
    ranges have already been standardized in some countries (Japan, Germany, Switzerland,
    etc.), but the resulting phenomena developed will benefit being described in more
    details, with a focus on the interaction between the converters and the electrical
    networks. The case of the presence of a large number of converters is also at
    stake. Some complex phenomena can also arise when the full system is not stable
    anymore. NOTE Whereas it is expected that the models and derived calculations
    form this document can be applied to the Americas electrical systems its formal
    validation studies are still pending."
