abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-2-15: 2023 which is a Technical Report, addresses in particular
    the following main phenomena, which affect the power quality in modern distribution
    systems with high penetration of power electronics converters. As some aspects
    of the subject have already been addressed in the past, considering the evolution
    of the LV and MV networks, this document focuses on the following aspects:&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt;\r\nresonances in the network, modelling and on-site validation;&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt;\r\nsupraharmonics and measurements issues;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nimpact
    of increased number of power electronic converters;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nstability
    and instability issues for the equipment to be connected&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nThe
    target phenomena and conditions of this document are the following:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nfrequency:
    ≤ 2 kHz, 2 kHz to 9 kHz, ≥ 9 kHz;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nvoltage levels: LV, MV;&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt;\r\nharmonic sources: all types of converters (EV battery chargers,
    appliances, etc.…).&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nSome of these frequency ranges have already
    been standardized in some countries (Japan, Germany, Switzerland, etc.), but the
    resulting phenomena developed will benefit being described in more details, with
    a focus on the interaction between the converters and the electrical networks.
    The case of the presence of a large number of converters is also at stake. Some
    complex phenomena can also arise when the full system is not stable anymore. NOTE Whereas
    it is expected that the models and derived calculations form this document can
    be applied to the Americas electrical systems its formal validation studies are
    still pending."
