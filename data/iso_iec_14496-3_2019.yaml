abstract:
- content: "<p>This document integrates many different types of audio coding: natural
    sound with synthetic sound, low bitrate delivery with high-quality delivery, speech
    with music, complex soundtracks with simple ones, and traditional content with
    interactive and virtual-reality content. This document standardizes individually
    sophisticated coding tools to provide a novel, flexible framework for audio synchronization,
    mixing, and downloaded post-production.</p><p>This document does not target a
    single application such as real-time telephony or high-quality audio compression.
    Rather, it applies to<em>every</em> application requiring the use of advanced
    sound compression, synthesis, manipulation, or playback. This document specifies
    the state-of-the-art coding tools in several domains. As the tools it defines
    are integrated with the rest of the ISO/IEC 14496 series, exciting new possibilities
    for object-based audio coding, interactive presentation, dynamic soundtracks,
    and other sorts of new media, are enabled.</p>"
