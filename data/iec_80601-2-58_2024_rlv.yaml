    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 80601-2-58:2024
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of LENS REMOVAL DEVICES
    and VITRECTOMY DEVICES for ophthalmic surgery (as defined in 201.3.209 and 201.3.217)
    and associated ACCESSORIES that can be connected to this MEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT,
    hereafter referred to as ME EQUIPMENT. If a clause or subclause is specifically
    intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT only, or to ME SYSTEMS only, the title
    and content of that clause or subclause will say so. If that is not the case,
    the clause or subclause applies both to ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS, as relevant.<br
    />\r\nHAZARDS inherent in the intended physiological function of ME EQUIPMENT
    or ME SYSTEMS within the scope of this document are not covered by specific requirements
    in this document except in 7.2.13 of IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601 1:2005/AMD2:2020

    to align with amendments to IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC
    60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 and other collateral standards;<br />\r\nc) updated normative
    references;<br />\r\nd) added new requirement for particulate matter from APPLIED
    PARTS in 201.9.5.101;<br />\r\ne) adding the shadow light method in 201.12.1.101.7;<br
    />\r\nf) clarify test conditions for EMC requirements in 202.7.1.2;<br />\r\ng)
    updated Table D.4 references to include specific IEC references to the symbols
    and delete “Annex AA, 201.7.6.101”;<br />\r\nh) include a new annex to address
    the relevant general safety and performance requirements of European regulation
    (EU) 2017/745 (Annex BB);<br />\r\ni) remove all references of the LIQUEFACTION
