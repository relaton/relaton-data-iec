abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-3-16:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62841-3-16:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62841-1:2014 and IEC 62841-1:2014/AMD1:2025.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62841-3-16:2025
    applies to transportable belt sanders, disc sanders and belt/disc sanders which
    are equipped with<br />\r\n– a sanding belt; or<br />\r\n– a sanding disc; or<br
    />\r\n– a sanding belt and a sanding disc<br />\r\nfor sanding solid materials.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to hand-held disc-type sanders.<br />\r\nNOTE
    101 Hand-held disc-type sanders are covered by IEC 62841-2-3.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not apply to hand-held belt sanders.<br />\r\nNOTE 102 Hand-held belt sanders
    are covered by IEC 62841-2-4.<br />\r\nThis Part 3-16 is to be used in conjunction
    with the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014 and IEC 62841-1:2014/AMD1:2025.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 3-16 supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC
    62841-1:2014, so as to convert it into the IEC Standard: Particular requirements
    for transportable belt sanders, disc sanders and belt/disc sanders.<br />\r\nWhere
    a particular subclause of IEC 62841-1:2014 is not mentioned in this Part 3-16,
    that subclause applies as far as relevant. Where this document states \"addition\",
    \"modification\" or \"replacement\", the relevant text in IEC 62841-1:2014 is
    to be adapted accordingly.<br />\r\nNOTE The attention of National Committees
    is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations can
    need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.<br />\r\nIt is the
    recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted
    for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication."
