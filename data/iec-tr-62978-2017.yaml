  content: IEC TR 62978:2017(E) gives guidelines on the current asset management perspectives
    for HVDC installations based on best practices of asset owners, operators, users,
    original equipment manufacturers and regulators within the power industry. This
    document covers HVDC systems with Line-Commutated Converters (LCC) and can be
    generally applied to Voltage Sourced Converters (VSC), not including specific
    equipment or sub-equipment required under VSC. This document provides base guidelines
    on fundamental aspects and prudent practices to be considered by stake holders
    in managing HVDC assets. Compliance to additional requirements and recommendations
    stipulated in this document by the supplier or OEM are non-obligatory, unless
    explicitly specified by the customer.
