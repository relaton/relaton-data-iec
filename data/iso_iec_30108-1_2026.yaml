abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines biometric services used for
    identity assurance that are invoked over a services-based framework. It provides
    a generic set of biometric and identity-related functions and associated data
    definitions to allow remote access to biometric services.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The
    binding of these services to specific frameworks is not included in this document
    but is the subject of other parts of the ISO/IEC 30108 series.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Although
    focused on biometrics, this document includes support for other related identity
    assurance mechanisms such as biographic and document capabilities. IAVS is intended
    to be compatible with and used in conjunction with other biometric standards as
    described in Clause 6.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Specification of biometric functionality
    is limited to remote (backend) services. Services between a client-side application
    and biometric capture devices are not within the scope of this document.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">Integration of biometric services as part of an authentication
    service or protocol is not within the scope of this document.</p>
