abstract:
- content: IEC 60898-3:2019+A1:2022 applies to DC circuit-breakers, having a rated
    DC voltage not exceeding 440 V, a rated current not exceeding 125 A and a rated
    short-circuit capacity not exceeding 10 000 A. These circuit-breakers are intended
    for the protection against overcurrents of wiring installations of buildings and
    similar applications; they are designed for use by uninstructed people and for
    not being maintained.
