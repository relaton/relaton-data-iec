    <p>This document specifies a family of logic languages designed for use in the representation and interchange of information and data among disparate computer systems.</p>
    <p>The following features are essential to the design of this document.</p>
    <p>—          Languages in the family have declarative semantics. It is possible to understand the meaning of expressions in these languages without appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions.</p>
    <p>—          Languages in the family are logically comprehensive ? at its most general, they provide for the expression of arbitrary first-order logical sentences.</p>
    <p>—          Languages in the family are translatable by a semantics-preserving transformation to a common XML-based syntax, facilitating interchange of information among heterogeneous computer systems.</p>
    <p>The following are within the scope of this document:</p>
    <p>—        representation of information in ontologies and knowledge bases;</p>
    <p>—        specification of expressions that are the input or output of inference engines;</p>
    <p>—        formal interpretations of the symbols in the language.</p>
    <p>The following are outside the scope of this document:</p>
    <p>—        specification of proof theory or inference rules;</p>
    <p>—        specification of translators between the notations of heterogeneous computer systems;</p>
    <p>—          computer-based operational methods of providing relationships between symbols in the logical "universe of discourse" and individuals in the "real world".</p>
    <p>This document describes Common Logic's syntax and semantics.</p>
    <p>This document defines an abstract syntax and an associated model-theoretic semantics for a specific extension of first-order logic. The intent is that the content of any system using first-order logic can be represented in this document. The purpose is to facilitate interchange of first-order logic-based information between systems.</p>
    <p>Issues relating to computability using this document (including efficiency, optimization, etc.) are not addressed.</p>
