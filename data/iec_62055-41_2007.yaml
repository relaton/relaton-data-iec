abstract:
- content: specifies the application layer protocol of the STS for transferring units
    of credit and other management information from a point-of-sale (POS) system to
    an STS-compliant payment meter in a one-way token carrier system. It is primarily
    intended for application with electricity payment meters without a tariff employing
    energy-based tokens, but may also have application with currency-based token systems
    and for services other than electricity.
