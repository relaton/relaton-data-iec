  content: "Establishing a zero-carbon power system is essential for achieving carbon
    neutrality. Transitioning to a clean energy world with different renewable energies
    is complicated, however.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor one, we must ensure a safe and
    steady power supply. At the same time, the rising proportion of new energy types
    needs to be acknowledged while keeping a reasonable cost for the entire power
    system.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe new IEC technology and market outlook paper (TMOP)
    recognizes hydropower as a technically mature, widely applied, economical and
    flexibly regulated power source to support a zero-carbon power system. It outlines
    and analyzes the main driving forces for hydropower’s development, current status
    of global development and also provides an overview of the key technologies and
    technical challenges.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe paper notes that smart hydropower
    is expanding the functions of traditional hydropower, carrying forward its advantages
    and overcoming its shortcomings. A smarter system will provide more efficient
    and economical energy solutions for countries, which also align with sustainable
    development goals.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the paper highlights the important
    role standards can play in promoting the development of hydropower, including
    smarter technologies. It shows potential use-cases and identifies where standardization
    is most needed, and urges standardization bodies to address needs for smart hydropower
    and related technologies to help stay sufficiently on track for net-zero goals.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis TMOP has been prepared by a project team from a variety of
    organizations, including representatives from power suppliers, universities, research
    institutes and industry associations, working under the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis TMOP is available for
    <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/smart-hydropower\">free download</a>."
