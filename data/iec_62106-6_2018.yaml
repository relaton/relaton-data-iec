abstract:
- content: "IEC 62106-6:2018 contains the technical specifications for Open Data Applications
    in the public domain. This document is maintained by the RDS Forum Office. The
    RDS Forum Office applies an easy procedure for registering new Open Data Applications,
    to ensure that they can be used without the need to change the RDS standard. The
    ODA feature permits defining new applications that can be decoded on a receiver.
    The receiver needs to the adequate software handler for the specific AID, which
    identifies the application. Receivers that have not implemented the software handler
    needed for decoding are not affected by ODA data received for any of the applications
    already defined and specified.<br />\r\nThe procedure for registering a new ODA
    is described in IEC 62106-3.<br />\r\nIEC 62106-6:2018 together with IEC 62106-1,
    IEC 62106-2, IEC 62106-3, IEC 62106-4 and IEC 62106-5, cancels and replaces IEC
    62106:2015, and constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to IEC 62106:2015:<br
    />\r\n• Provision has been made to carry RDS on multiple data-streams (RDS2);<br
    />\r\n• New are AF coding below 87,5 MHz (down to 64,0 MHz) using ODA-AID 0x6365;<br
    />\r\n• RT+ can now be used simultaneously for RT and eRT, each having its own
    RT+ ODA;<br />\r\n• Data-streams 1, 2 and 3 are exclusively UTF-8 coded. For backwards
    compatibility, UCS-2 encoded eRT on data-stream 0 is retained."
