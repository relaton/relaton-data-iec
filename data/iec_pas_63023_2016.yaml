abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63023:2016 establishes a unique input interface for connection
    of an external alarming device to haemodialysis equipment. The input interface
    of the haemodialysis equipment is designed as a simple solution, which takes a
    single fault condition of the input interface into account, to stop the extracorporeal
    blood flow in case of needles slipping out from the fistula or graft detected
    by the external alarming device.
