abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 11179-2:2019 This document compliments ISO/IEC 11179-3 by describing
    registration of classification schemes and using them to classify registered items
    in an MDR. Any metadata item can be made a Classifiable_Item so it can be classified,
    which can include object classes, properties, representations, conceptual domains,
    value domains, data element concepts and data elements themselves.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not establish a particular classification scheme as pre-eminent.
    Sanction of a particular taxonomic approach and/or a particular epistemology is
    also beyond the scope of this document. These are addressed by other standards
    committees and/or tend to be tailored to a particular domain of discourse. The
    MDR can establish its own classification schemes, and other standards committees
    are developing or have developed normative languages for use in classification
    and/or particular techniques and structures that can be accommodated by this document.<br
    />\r\nEach registration authority, as described and specified in ISO/IEC 11179-6,
    can classify classifiable items according to the classification schemes, structures
    and content that it deems appropriate. In documenting the classification aspects
    of classifiable items, the registration authority can use the principles, methods,
    procedures and attributes covered in this document."
