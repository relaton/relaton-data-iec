    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13238 enables the bulk transfer of all or part of the data contained in an</p>
    <p>Information Resource Dictionary (IRD) or in an Information Resource Dictionary Definition</p>
    <p>conforming to ISO/IEC 10728:1993 IRDS Services Interface.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13238 defines a format for such a transfer and also services to generate</p>
    <p>the export file and services to import the file. These services are additional to the existing</p>
    <p>services defined in the IRDS Services Interface.</p>
    <p>This version of this part of ISO/IEC 13238 defines a limited set of Export and Import</p>
    <p>services. It is expected that implementations will also provide more sophisticated services</p>
    <p>based on the use of the Transfer File structure defined in this part of ISO/IEC 13238.</p>
    <p>The physical way in which the transfer takes place is outside the scope of this part of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 13238. Each transfer may be effected in one of several ways including the physical</p>
    <p>transfer of the data using a transportable storage device.</p>
