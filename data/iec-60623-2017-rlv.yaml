  content: "IEC 60623:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60623:2017
    specifies marking, designation, dimensions, tests and requirements for vented
    nickel-cadmium prismatic secondary single cells. When there exists an IEC standard
    specifying test conditions and requirements for cells used in special applications
    and which is in conflict with this document, the former takes precedence.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- optional characterization of cells designed for performances
    at very low and/or very high temperature;<br />\r\n- optional characterization
    of cells tested with CCCV charge;<br />\r\n- optional characterization of cells
    designed for rapid charge;<br />\r\n- optional characterization of cells designed
    for high cycling."
