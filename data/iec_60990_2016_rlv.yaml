abstract:
- content: "IEC 60990:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60990:2016 defines
    measurement methods for d.c. or a.c. current of sinusoidal or non-sinusoidal waveform,
    which could flow through the human body, and current flowing through a protective
    conductor. The measuring methods recommended for TOUCH CURRENT are based upon
    the possible effects of current flowing through a human body. In this standard,
    measurements of current through networks representing the impedance of the human
    body are referred to as measurements of TOUCH CURRENT. These networks are not
    necessarily valid for the bodies of animals. The specification or implication
    of specific limit values is not within the scope of this standard. IEC TS 60479
    series provides information regarding the effects of current passing through the
    human body from which limit values may be derived. This standard is applicable
    to all classes of EQUIPMENT, according to IEC 61140. The methods of measurement
    in this standard are not intended to be used for TOUCH CURRENTS having less than
    1 s duration, patient currents as defined in IEC 60601-1, a.c. at frequencies
    below 15 Hz, and currents above those chosen for ELECTRIC BURN limits. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 1999. It constitutes
    a technical revision. The principal changes in this edition as compared with the
    second edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- the effects names have been updated
    to reflect increased understanding of the range of effects and is in concert with
    present usage;<br />\r\n- the conditions of use invoking a GRIPPABLE PART have
    been reduced in the application of the requirements based upon the current understanding
    of this effect;<br />\r\n- the references to ISO 10012-1, which has been replaced
    by management standard of the same number, have been replaced with explanatory
    text, where needed to maintain the sense of the document;<br />\r\n- former informative
    Annex H (GRIPPABLE PART) has been deleted from this update as it does not properly
    represent the full set of conditions under which immobilization can occur. A new
    informative Annex H (Analysis of frequency filtered touch current circuits measurement)
    has been added and the Bibliography (formerly Annex M) has been updated with additional
    references for completeness. This basic safety publication is primarily intended
    for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards in accordance
    with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. It is not
    intended for use by manufacturers or certification bodies independent of product
    standards.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a Basic Safety Publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\nKeywords: Touch Current, Protective Conductor Current,
    Current Flow"
