abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-27-1:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0. It defines a service type referred to herein as FriendlyInfoUpdate
    service. It is scoped to the Device Description Document (DDD) and is a service
    allowing control points to create orderly updates to the &lt;friendlyName&gt;
    and &lt;iconList&gt; elements. Once a change has taken place the status of the
    DDD might not reflect that of the advertised description because the device can
    not leave the network during ongoing activities. Therefore a state variable is
    provided to indicate if the DDD contains non-advertised (pending) values. If for
    any reason the device goes off line, power cycles, or reboots it will most likely
    advertise its new DDD. If DeviceProtection UPnP DP is implemented on the device
    then it will support restricting control point actions to control points with
    specific Roles.</p>"
