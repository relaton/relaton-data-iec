abstract:
- content: "<p>Thin flexible cards, the subject of this International Standard, are
    used to automate the controls for access to goods or services such as mass transit,
    highway toll systems, car parks, vouchers, stored value, etc.</p><p>For these
    applications, data can be written and/or read by machines using various recording
    techniques such as magnetic stripe, optical character recognition (OCR), bar code,
    etc.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 15457 specifies the test methods and procedures
    required to carry out measurements of the magnetic stripe and encoding characteristics
    of thin flexible cards.</p><p>Many of the standard methods available for checking
    physical properties of base materials are intended to be applied to samples cut
    from continuous material or large sheets. However, all test methods given herein,
    unless explicitly stated otherwise, apply to finished cards.</p><p>The test methods
    described are to be performed on separate samples. It is not intended that any
    individual card should pass through more than one test procedure, unless explicitly
    stated.</p><p>Acceptance criteria do not form part of this standard.</p>"
