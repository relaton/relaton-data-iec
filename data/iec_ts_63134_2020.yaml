abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63134:2020 identifies AAL scenarios and use cases based on real-world
    applications and requirements. The use cases provide a practical context for considerations
    of interoperability and standards based on user experience. Use cases provide
    a context for utilizing existing standards and identifying further standardization
    work. User requirements have also been identified.<br />\r\nThis document also
    highlights potential areas for standardization in the AAL environment to ensure
    safety, security, privacy, ease of operation, performance and interoperability.<br
    />\r\nLastly, this document is a contribution to the IEC use case management repository,
    the purpose of which is to collect, administer, maintain, and analyse use cases."
