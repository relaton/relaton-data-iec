abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-032:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 61010-2-032:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD1:2016.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-032:2023
    EXV specifies safety requirements for hand-held and hand-manipulated current sensors
    intended for measuring, detecting or injecting current, or indicating current
    waveforms on circuits without physically opening the current path of the circuit
    being measured.<br />\r\nThese current sensors are hand-manipulated before and/or
    after a test or measurement, but are not necessarily hand-held during the test
    or measurement. They can be stand-alone current sensors or accessories to other
    equipment or parts of combined equipment. These include measurement circuits which
    are part of electrical test and measurement equipment, laboratory equipment, or
    process control equipment.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the
    fourth edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) In 1.1.1, definitions of current sensor types
    have been moved to a new Annex FF;<br />\r\nb) Clause 2, all normative references
    have been dated and new normative references have been added;<br />\r\nc) 3.2.103,
    a new definition protective fingerguard has been added which replaces the previous
    definition of protective barrier;<br />\r\nd) 4.4.2.101 is a new subclause about
    surge protective devices;<br />\r\ne) in 5.1.5.101.2, minimum ratings for voltage
    of measuring terminals are required;<br />\r\nf) Subclause 6.5.1 has been modified;<br
    />\r\ng) Subclause 6.5.5 is no longer used;<br />\r\nh) Subclause 6.6.101 modifies
    6.6.101 and 6.6.102 of previous edition:<br />\r\n1) in 6.6.101.1, insulating
    material of group I may be allowed for determination of creepage distances of
    measuring circuit terminals;<br />\r\n2) in 6.6.101.2, clearances and creepage
    distances up to 3 000 V for measuring circuit terminals in unmated position have
    been defined;<br />\r\n3) in 6.6.101.3, requirements for measuring circuit terminals
    in partially mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n4) in 6.6.101.4, requirements
    for measuring circuit terminals in mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n5)
    Subclause 6.6.101.5 replaces 6.6.102;<br />\r\ni) Subclause 6.6.102 replaces 6.101
    of previous edition with modifications;<br />\r\nj) Subclause 6.101.2 replaces
    6.9.101.1 of previous edition with modifications;<br />\r\nk) Subclause 6.101.3
    replaces 6.9.101.2 of previous edition with modifications;<br />\r\nl) Subclause
    6.101.4 replaces 6.9.102 of previous edition with modifications;<br />\r\nm) in
    8.101, jaw ends abrasion test has been modified;<br />\r\nn) 8.105 is a new subclause
    for input/output leads attachment has been added;<br />\r\no) in 9.101.2, relocation
    of 101.3 of previous edition;<br />\r\np) in 9.101.3, relocation of 101.4 of previous
    edition, extension to measurement category II and reference to IEC 61000-4-5 for
    tests:<br />\r\nq) Table 104 has been replaced by Table K.101:<br />\r\nr) in
    9.102, relocation of Clause 102 of previous edition;<br />\r\ns) in 14.101, relocation
    of 14.102. Subclause 14.101 of previous edition has been deleted;<br />\r\nt)
    101.3 is a new subclause for protections against hazard occurring from reading
    a voltage value in replacement of Clause EE.5 of previous edition;<br />\r\nu)
    in Table D.101, transients are disregarded for insulation between jaw ends and
    input/output circuits;<br />\r\nv) in Clause F.101, test voltages for routine
    test of jaws have been modified;<br />\r\nw) in K.2.1, another method for determination
    of clearances of secondary circuits is proposed;<br />\r\nx) in K.3.2, new Table
    K.15 and Table K.16 for clearance calculation;<br />\r\ny) K.3.101 is a new clause;<br
    />\r\nz) Clause K.4, redraft of the clause to propose a method for determination
    of Ut for circuits which reduce transient overvoltages;<br />\r\naa) Table K.101
    replaces Table 104;<br />\r\nbb) Subclause K.101.4 has been reviewed and tables
    and tests for solid insulation have been modified;<br />\r\ncc) Table K.104 of
    previous edition has been deleted;<br />\r\ndd) Annex AA: Figure AA.1 has been
    redesigned;<br />\r\nee) Annex EE: addition of a new informative annex for determination
    of clearances for Table 101;<br />\r\nff) Annex GG: this annex was Annex EE of
    previous edition and the current sensor type of a clamp multimeter is type A or
    type B."
