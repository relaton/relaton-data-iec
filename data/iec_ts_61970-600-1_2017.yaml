abstract:
- content: "IEC 61970-600-1:2017(E) defines the main rules and requirements related
    to the CGMES which are mandatory for achieving interoperability with the CGMES
    and for satisfying business processes. The profiles which belong to CGMES are
    defined in IEC 61970-600-2:2017. The CGMES is defined using information on the
    Common Information Model (CIM) available in the public domain. Future editions
    of this technical specification will be released to describe following CGMES versions
    which will reflect additional requirements due to European network codes or guidelines.<br
