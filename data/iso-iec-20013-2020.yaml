    <p>This document specifies a reference framework of e-Portfolio implementation that can be used to inform and support development of ITLET systems that meet the requirements of learners, instructors, e-learning service providers and others in contexts such as K-12 education, higher education, training and personal development.</p>
    <p>The reference framework identifies content and functional components that support e-Portfolio systems. It addresses interoperability issues required for data exchange between these components and among the various categories.</p>
    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>—     provides an e-Portfolio reference framework;</p>
    <p>—     provides descriptions of e-Portfolios in terms of components (content or functional), categories, elements and items;</p>
    <p>—     identifies commonalities of current implementations of e-Portfolios; and,</p>
    <p>—     represents the needs of stakeholders (learners, instructors, etc.).</p>
    <p>This document does not include:</p>
    <p>—     in-depth technical review of issues related to adaptability to culture, language, and human functions;</p>
    <p>—     security techniques related to the protection of privacy information;</p>
    <p>—     authentication of the identity of an IT or ITLET system user;</p>
    <p>—     how e-Portfolios might integrate with ITLET systems; and,</p>
    <p>—     specific requirements of e-Portfolios or e-Portfolio systems to meet jurisdictional domain requirements.</p>
