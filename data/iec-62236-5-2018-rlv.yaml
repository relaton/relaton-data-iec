  content: "IEC 62236-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62236-5:2018
    applies to emission and immunity aspects of EMC for electrical and electronic
    apparatus and systems intended for use in railway fixed installations for power
    supply. This includes the power feed to the apparatus, the apparatus itself with
    its protective control circuits, trackside items such as switching stations, power
    autotransformers, booster transformers, substation power switchgear and power
    switchgear to other longitudinal and local supplies. This new edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    clarification of certain parts of the standard; extension of emission and immunity
    requirements."
