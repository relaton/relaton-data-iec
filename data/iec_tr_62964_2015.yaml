abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62964:2015(E) provides the result of a study of some of the graphical
    symbols for use on equipment standardized in IEC 60417 being primarily intended
    to:<br />\r\n- identify the equipment or a part of the equipment (e.g. a control
    or display);<br />\r\n- indicate a functional state (e.g. on, off, alarm);<br
    />\r\n- designate connections (e.g. terminals, filling points for materials);<br
    />\r\n- provide information on packaging (e.g. identification of contents, instructions
    for handling);<br />\r\n- provide instruction for the operation of the equipment
    (e.g. limitations of use);<br />\r\n- in the focus of contemporary use of graphical
    symbols for use on multimedia equipment, and new possible meanings to be envisaged
    as well as new graphical symbols not yet standardized in IEC 60417."
