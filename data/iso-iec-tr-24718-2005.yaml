  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24718:2005 gives a complete description of the motivations
    behind the Ada Ravenscar Profile, to show how conformant programs can be analysed
    and to give examples of usage. The profile is a subset of the Ada tasking model,
    restricted to meet the real-time community requirements for determinism, schedulability
    analysis and memory-boundedness, as well as being suitable for mapping to a small
    and efficient run-time system that supports task synchronization and communication,
    and which could be certifiable to the highest integrity levels. The profile has
    been designed such that the restricted form of tasking that it defines can be
    used even for software that needs to be verified to the very highest integrity
    levels. </p>"
