abstract:
- content: "<p>Message Authentication Code (MAC) algorithms are data integrity mechanisms
    that compute a short string (the Message Authentication Code or MAC) as a complex
    function of every bit of the data and of a secret key. Their main security property
    is unforgeability: someone who does not know the secret key should not be able
    to predict the MAC on any new data string.</p><p>MAC algorithms can be used to
    provide data integrity. Their purpose is the detection of any unauthorized modification
    of the data such as deletion, insertion, or transportation of items within data.
    This includes both malicious and accidental modifications. MAC algorithms can
    also provide data origin authentication. This means that they can provide assurance
    that a message has been originated by an entity in possession of a specific secret
    key.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011 specifies three MAC algorithms that are based on
    a dedicated hash-function (selected from ISO/IEC 10118-3).</p><p>ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011
    specifies three MAC algorithms that use a secret key and a hash-function (or its
    round-function) with an<em>n</em>-bit result to calculate an<em>m</em>-bit MAC.</p><p>The
    strength of the data integrity mechanism and message authentication mechanism
    is dependent on the length (in bits)<em>k</em> and secrecy of the key, on the
    length (in bits)<em>n</em> of the hash-function and its strength, on the length
    (in bits)<em>m</em> of the MAC, and on the specific mechanism.</p><p>The first
    mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011 is commonly known as MDx-MAC. It calls
    the complete hash-function once, but it makes a small modification to the round-function
    by adding a key to the additive constants in the round-function. The second mechanism
    specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011 is commonly known as HMAC. It calls the complete
    hash-function twice. The third mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2011 is a
    variant of MDx-MAC that takes as input only short strings (at most 256 bits).
    It offers a higher performance for applications that work with short input strings
    only.</p>"
