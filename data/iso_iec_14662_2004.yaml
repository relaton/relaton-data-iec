abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14662:2004 specifies the framework for coordinating the integration
    of existing International Standards and the development of future International
    Standards for the inter-working of Open-edi Parties via Open-edi and provides
    a reference for those International Standards. As such, it serves to guide the
    work necessary to accomplish Open-edi by providing the context to be used by developers
    of International Standards to ensure the coherence and integration of related
    standardized modelling and descriptive techniques, services, service interfaces
    and protocols.<br /><br />\r\nThis International Standard describes, through two
    perspectives of business transactions, significant aspects relevant to the interoperability
    of information technology systems used by Open-edi Parties engaging in Open-edi.
    The perspectives are:<br />\r\nbusiness aspects such as business information,
    business conventions, agreements and rules among Open-edi Parties; and<br />\r\ninformation
    technology aspects which are necessary in the Open-edi systems to support the
    execution of business transactions.<br /><br />\r\nThis International Standard
    is not an implementation specification nor is it a basis for appraising the conformance
    of implementations."
