abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63473:2024 is to describe the process of building an inventory
    of international standards based on use cases, mapping these international standards
    to individual use cases, and providing a visual representation in the IEC mapping
    platform.<br />\r\nThis document identifies the main categories of international
    standards applicable to AAL systems and applies these international standards
    to AAL components and the complete AAL system.<br />\r\nAlthough there are national
    and regional standards that can address parts of AAL systems, this document will
    focus only on standards developed at the international level (e.g., IEC, ISO,
    ITUâ€‘T)."
