  content: "IEC TR 60493-3:2017(E) clarifies how a statistical analysis can be done
    with a small number of samples.</br>\r\nThis document will be useful when the
    accelerated test method is difficult to carry out, for example in cases where
    the dimensions of test specimens (including test devices) are very large in scale
    or the cost of test specimens is high. Testing is facilitated by enabling users
    to reduce the number of test specimens."
