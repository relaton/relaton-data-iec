  content: "<p>The standard identifies gateways for field-bus networks, data storage
    for archiving and developing data sharing platforms, and application units as
    important system components for developing digital communities, i.e., building-scale
    and city-wide ubiquitous facility networking infrastructure. The standard defines
    a data exchange protocol that generalizes and interconnects these components (gateways,
    storage, application units) over the IPv4/v6-based networks. This enables integration
    of multiple facilities, data storage, application services such as central management,
    energy saving, environmental monitoring, and alarm notification systems.</p>"
