abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15772:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Common Information additional network feature (ANF-CMN) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>ANF-CMN is an additional
    network feature which enables the exchange of Common Information between entities
    acting on behalf of the two ends of a connection through a PISN. This Common Information
    is a collection of miscellaneous information that relates to the user or equipment
    at one end of a connection and includes one or more of the following: Feature
    Identifiers, Party Category, Equipment Identity. This information, when received
    by an entity, can be used for any purpose, e.g. as the basis for indications to
    the local user or to another network or in order to filter feature requests.</p><p>The
    Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Additional network feature
    specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification
    for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage
    1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15771.</p><p>The signalling protocol for
    ANF-CMN operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched
    call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic
    procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15772:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the
    support of interactions at the Q reference point between ANF-CMN and other supplementary
    services and ANFs.</p>"
