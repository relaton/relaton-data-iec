abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62898-2:2018 provides guidelines for operation of microgrids. Microgrids
    considered in this document are alternating current (AC) electrical systems with
    loads and distributed energy resources (DER) at low or medium voltage level. This
    document does not cover direct current (DC) microgrids.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62898-2
    applies to operation and control of microgrids, including:<br />\r\n• operation
    modes and mode transfer;<br />\r\n• energy management system (EMS) and control
    of microgrids;<br />\r\n• communication and monitoring procedures;<br />\r\n•
    electrical energy storage;<br />\r\n• protection principle covering: principle
    for non-isolated microgrid, isolated microgrid, anti-islanding, synchronization
    and reclosing, power quality;<br />\r\n• commissioning, maintenance and test."
