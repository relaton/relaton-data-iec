    <p>ISO/IEC 30107-2:2017 defines data formats for conveying the mechanism used in biometric presentation attack detection and for conveying the results of presentation attack detection methods. The attacks considered in the ISO/IEC 30107 series take place at the sensor during the presentation and collection of the biometric characteristics. Any other attacks are outside the scope of this document.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 30107-2:2017 contains the following data formats: a binary format and an XML schema. The data interchange formats in this document are generic, in that they may be applied and used in a wide range of application areas. No application-specific requirements are addressed here.</p>
    <p>Provisions for the cryptographic protection of the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of stored and transmitted presentation attack detection data are beyond the scope of this document.</p>
    <p>NOTE       While addressing security is out of the scope of this document, PAD data may be protected by encoding them into a biometric information record (see ISO/IEC 19785-1) that includes an optional security block.</p>
