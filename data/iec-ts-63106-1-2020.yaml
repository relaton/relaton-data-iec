  content: "IEC TS 63106-1:2020 provide recommendations for Low Voltage (LV) AC power
    simulators used for testing utility interactive photovoltaic power conversion
    equipment (PCE). This document establish terminology, and create a framework for,
    and provide guidance regarding the electrical performance of AC power simulators
    used to test utility interactive photovoltaic (PV) power conversion equipment
    (PCE) for compliance with grid interconnection standards.<br />\r\nIt serves as
    a generalized guideline for the development of AC power simulators used within
    a test and evaluation system for PV PCEs."
