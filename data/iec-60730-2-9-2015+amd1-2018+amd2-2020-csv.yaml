  content: "IEC 60730-2-9:2015+A1:2018+A2:2020 applies to automatic electrical temperature
    sensing controls for use in, on or in association with equipment, including electrical
    controls for heating, air-conditioning and similar applications. The equipment
    may use electricity, gas, oil, solid fuel, solar thermal energy, etc., or a combination
    thereof. This standard is applicable to automatic electrical temperature sensing
    controls forming part of a building automation control system within the scope
    of ISO 16484. This standard also applies to automatic electrical temperature sensing
    controls for equipment that may be used by the public, such as equipment intended
    to be used in shops, offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial applications.
    This standard does not apply to automatic electrical temperature sensing controls
    intended exclusively for industrial process applications, unless explicitly mentioned
    in the relevant equipment standard. This standard applies to the inherent safety,
    to the operating values, operating times, and operating sequences where such are
    associated with equipment safety, and to the testing of automatic electrical temperature
    sensing control devices used in, or in association with, equipment. This standard
    is also applicable to the functional safety of low complexity safety-related temperature
    sensing controls and systems. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2008, and its Amendment 1:2011. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes alignment with the text of 60730-1
    fifth edition and the following significant technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition:<br />\r\n- modification of heating-freezing tests in Clause
    12;<br />\r\n- alignment of the EMC requirements in H.26 to those in other part
    2 standards and<br />\r\n- addition of requirements in Clause H.27 to cover class
    B and C control functions of temperature sensing controls. This publication is
    to be read in conjunction with IEC 60730-1:2013. This consolidated version consists
    of the fourth edition (2015), its amendment 1 (2018) and its amendment 2 (2020).
    Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication."
