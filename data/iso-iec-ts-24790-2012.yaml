    <p>ISO/IEC TS 24790:2012 specifies device-independent image quality attributes, measurement methods, and analytical procedures to describe the quality of output images from hardcopy devices. It is applicable to human-readable monochrome documents produced from printers and copiers.</p>

    <p>The attributes, methods and procedures rely on measurable properties of printed text and graphic images. Special targets or reference images are not required, but image elements must meet some minimal requirements, e.g. on size or number present, in order to be useful for adequate measurements.</p>

    <p>ISO/IEC TS 24790:2012 is not applicable to images on media other than hardcopy (e.g. images on a VDT) or to images that are intended to be machine readable only (e.g. bar codes).</p>
