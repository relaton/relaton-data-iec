    <p>This document is a guideline for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. It addresses system, life cycle, organizational, project, and process, concept application, principally through reference to ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748‑1 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. It gives guidance on applying ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 from the aspects of strategy, planning, application in organizations, and application on projects. It also provides comparison of the differences between ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 and the prior versions, ISO/IEC 15288:2008.</p>
    <p>This document is intended to be consistent with both ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748‑1 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 in its treatment of life-cycle concepts and systems engineering processes.</p>
    <p>NOTE       Systems engineering for defense programs is addressed in IEEE Std 15288.1, Application of Systems Engineering on Defense Programs.</p>
