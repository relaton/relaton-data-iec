  content: "IEC 62256:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62256:2017
    covers turbines, storage pumps and pump-turbines of all sizes and of the following
    types: Francis; Kaplan; propeller; Pelton (turbines only) and bulb turbines.<br
    />\r\nThis document also identifies without detailed discussion, other powerhouse
    equipment that could affect or be affected by a turbine, storage pump, or pump-turbine
    rehabilitation. The object of this document is to assist in identifying, evaluating
    and executing rehabilitation and performance improvement projects for hydraulic
    turbines, storage pumps and pump-turbines. This document can be used by owners,
    consultants, and suppliers to define: needs and economics for rehabilitation and
    performance improvement; scope of work; specifications and evaluation of results.
    This document is intended to be: an aid in the decision process; an extensive
    source of information on rehabilitation; an identification of the key milestones
    in the rehabilitation process; and identification of the points to be addressed
    in the decision processes. This document is not intended to be a detailed engineering
    manual nor a maintenance document. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition: Tables 2 to 23 modified, completed and moved to Annex
    A; 7.3.2: subclauses moved with text changes; new subclauses on temperature, noise,
    galvanic corrosion, galling and replacement of components without assessment;
    7.3.3: complete new subclause on residual life; Tables 29 to 32 moved to Annex
    C; New Annex B with assessment examples.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey words: Turbines,
    Storage pump, Pump turbines, Rehabilitation, Performance."
