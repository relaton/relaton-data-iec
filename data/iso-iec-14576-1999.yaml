  content: This International Standard specifies the logical specifications of STbus
    which is a high-performance and highly reliable system bus. STbus adopts a synchronous
    transfer method with a high-speed clock and a split transfer method enabling to
    minimize bus holding time during one bus operation and to use a bus efficiently.
    This International Standard is applicable to a high-performance system bus or
    an I/O bus in a multiprocessor system. Typical STbus applications are a system
    bus and an I/O bus in a tightly coupled multiprocessor system, and a system bus
    in a loosely coupled multiprocessor system.
