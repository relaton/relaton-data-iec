abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29133:2010 specifies methodologies to be used for the conformance
    of rewritable hybrid media data carriers, which combine radio frequency identification
    (RFID) tag technology with linear and/or two-dimensional bar code symbologies
    that are written to an erasable substrate. Three main product configuration types
    are addressed within ISO/IEC 29133:2010:</p><ul><li>Rewritable Media, which supports
    the rewriting of linear or two-dimensional symbols;</li><li>Rewritable Hybrid
    Media, which integrates the Rewritable Media with an RFID tag;</li><li>Rewritable
    Media combined with RFID technology that are physically separate data carriers
    but still require their data encoding processes to be integrated as part of a
    Rewritable Hybrid Media system.</li></ul><p>In particular, ISO/IEC 29133:2010</p><ul><li>defines
    the base requirements for Rewritable Media and Rewritable Media devices,</li><li>defines
    additional methods for process control of the Rewritable Media over multiple erasure
    and rewrite cycles,</li><li>defines reference standards for evaluating the RFID
    tag component,</li><li>defines additional methods for process control of the RFID
    component over multiple erasure and rewrite cycles,</li><li>provides information
    to ensure that the data encoded in the bar code symbology and RFID data carrier
    are synchronous, i.e. are derived from the same source data set. Note that depending
    on the application, the encoded data can be identical or different (e.g. one data
    carrier could provide additional data).</li></ul>"
