abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-22:2009 specifies the Open Font Format (OFF) specification,
    the TrueType™ and Compact Font Format (CFF) outline formats, and the TrueType
    hinting language. It makes references to both TrueType and PostScript, as Open
    Font Format fonts combine the two technologies.</p><p>Multimedia applications
    require a broad range of media-related standards. In addition to the typical audio
    and video applications, multimedia presentations include scalable 2D graphics
    and text supporting all languages of the world. Faithful reproduction of scalable
    multimedia content requires additional components including scalable font technology.
    The Open Font Format is an extension of the TrueType font format, adding support
    for PostScript font data. OFF fonts and the operating system services which support
    OFF fonts provide users with a simple way to install and use fonts, whether the
    fonts contain TrueType outlines or CFF (PostScript) outlines.</p><p>The Open Font
    Format addresses the following goals:</p><ul><li>broader multi-platform support;</li><li>excellent
    support for international character sets;</li><li>excellent protection for font
    data;</li><li>smaller file sizes to make font distribution more efficient;</li><li>excellent
    support for advanced typographic control.</li></ul><p>PostScript® data included
    in OFF fonts may be directly rasterized or converted to the TrueType outline format
    for rendering, depending on which rasterizers have been installed in the host
    operating system. But the user model is the same: OFF fonts just work. Users will
    not need to be aware of the type of outline data in OFF fonts. And font creators
    can use whichever outline format they feel provides the best set of features for
    their work, without worrying about limiting a font's usability.</p><p>OFF fonts
    can include the OFF Layout tables, which allow font creators to design broader
    international and high-end typographic fonts. The OFF Layout tables contain information
    on glyph substitution, glyph positioning, justification, and baseline positioning,
    enabling text-processing applications to improve text layout.</p><p>As with TrueType
    fonts, OFF fonts allow the handling of large glyph sets using Unicode encoding.
    Such encoding allows broad international support, as well as support for typographic
    glyph variants.</p><p>Additionally, OFF fonts may contain digital signatures,
    which enable operating systems and browsing applications to identify the source
    and integrity of font files, including embedded font files obtained in web documents,
    before using them. Also, font developers can encode embedding restrictions in
    OFF fonts which cannot be altered in a font signed by the developer.</p>"
