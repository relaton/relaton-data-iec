  content: IEC TS 62738:2018(E) sets out general guidelines and recommendations for
    the design and installation of ground-mounted photovoltaic (PV) power plants.
    A PV power plant is defined within this document as a grid-connected, ground-mounted
    system comprising multiple PV arrays and interconnected directly to a utility’s
    medium voltage or high voltage grid. Additional criteria is that PV power plants
    are restricted from access by non-qualified persons and are continuously monitored
    for safety and protection, either by on-site personnel or by active remote monitoring.
    Technical areas addressed are those that largely distinguish PV power plants from
    smaller, more conventional installations, including ground mounted array configurations,
    cable routing methods, cable selection, overcurrent protection strategies, equipotential
    bonding over large geographical areas, and equipment considerations. Safety and
    design requirements are referenced to the applicable requirements of IEC 62548
    to address distinct differences relative to the design requirements for residential,
    commercial and other non-power plant applications.
