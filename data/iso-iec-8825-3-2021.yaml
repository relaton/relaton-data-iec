    <p>This document defines a notation for specifying encodings of ASN.1 types or of parts of types.</p>
    <p>It provides several mechanisms for such specification, including:</p>
    <p>–      direct specification of the encoding using standardized notation;</p>
    <p>–      specification of the encoding by reference to standardized encoding rules;</p>
    <p>–      specification of the encoding of an ASN.1 type by reference to an encoding structure;</p>
    <p>–      specification of the encoding using non-ECN notation.</p>
    <p>It also provides the means to link the specification of encodings to the type definitions to which they are to be applied.</p>
    <p>ECN does not currently provide any support for specifications using the OID internationalized resource identifier type or the relative OID internationalized resource identifier type (see Rec. ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1), and these are not referred to further in this Standard.</p>
