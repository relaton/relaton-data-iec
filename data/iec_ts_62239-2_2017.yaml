abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62239-2:2017(E) applies to the development of COTS assembly management
    plans for the integration and management of electronic COTS assemblies in electronic
    systems used in the ADHP markets where reliability is generally critical. Depending
    on program or product line requirements and/or the technical characteristics of
    the electronic COTS assemblies and in agreement with the customer, the electronic
    COTS assembly management plans could consider tailoring the requirements of this
    document. Although developed for the avionics industry, this document can be applied
    by other high performance and high reliability industries at their discretion.
