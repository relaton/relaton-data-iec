  content: 'IEC 60747-5-13:2021+AMD1:2026 CSV provides the accelerated test method
    to assess effects of the tarnishing of silver and silver alloys used for LED packages
    due to hydrogen sulphide. Particularly, this test method is intended to give information
    on silver and silver alloy tarnishing effects to the luminous/radiant flux maintenance
    of LED packages. Additionally, this test method can give information on electric
    performances of LED packages due to corrosion of silver and silver alloys. The
    object of this test is to determine the influence of atmospheres containing hydrogen
    sulphide on parts of LED packages made of: silver or silver alloy; silver or silver
    alloy protected with another layer; other metals covered with silver or silver
    alloy. Testing other degradations that are susceptible to affect luminous/radiant
    flux maintenance and/or electric performance (e.g. degradation of copper or silicone
    parts) is not the object of this test. This test might not be suitable as a general
    corrosion test, i.e. it might not predict the behaviour of flux and/or electric
    characteristics and connections in industrial atmospheres. This document is applicable
    to LED packages for lighting applications only if referenced by an IEC SC 34A
    document.'
