abstract:
- content: "IEC/TS 62600-200:2013(E) provides the following items:<br />\r\n- a systematic
    methodology for evaluating the power performance of tidal current energy converters
    (TECs) that produce electricity for utility scale and localized grids;<br />\r\n-
    a definition of TEC rated power and rated water velocity;<br />\r\n- a methodology
    for the production of the power curves for the TECs in consideration;<br />\r\n-
    a framework for the reporting of results."
