  content: "IEC 60947-5-8:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60947-5-8:2020
    specifies requirements for three-position enabling switches. These switches are
    used as components of enabling devices to provide signals that,<br />\r\n- when
    activated, allow machine operation to be initiated by a separate start control,
    and<br />\r\n- when de-activated,<br />\r\n-- initiate a stop function, and<br
    />\r\n-- prevent initiation of machine operation.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2006. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- due to the increasing
    range of useful applications of three-position enabling switches, note of scope,
    operational characteristics and tests are reviewed;<br />\r\n- figures for example
    of devices incorporating enabling switch are added in Annex A;<br />\r\n- new
    Annex B for procedure to determine reliability data for the switch used in functional
    safety applications is added."
