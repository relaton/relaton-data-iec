    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61347-2-8:2024
    specifies safety requirements for ballasts, excluding resistance types, for use
    on AC supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz, associated with fluorescent lamps
    with or without pre-heated cathodes operated with or without a starter or starting
    device and having rated powers, dimensions and characteristics as specified in
    IEC 60081 and IEC 60901. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2000 and Amendment 1:2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
