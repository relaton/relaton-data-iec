  content: "IEC TR 60919-2:2008+A1:2015+A2:2020 provides guidance on the transient
    performance and fault protection requirements of high voltage direct current (HVDC)
    systems. It concerns the transient performance related to faults and switching
    for two-terminal HVDC systems utilizing 12-pulse converter units comprised of
    three-phase bridge (double way) connections but it does not cover multi-terminal
    HVDC transmission systems. However, certain aspects of parallel converters and
    parallel lines, if part of a two-terminal system, are discussed. The converters
    are assumed to use thyristor valves as the bridge arms, with gapless metal oxide
    arresters for insulation co-ordination and to have power flow capability in both
    directions. Diode valves are not considered in this report. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 1991, and constitutes a technical
    revision. It includes the following main changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- it concerns only line-commutated converters;<br />\r\n- isignificant
    changes have been made to the control system technology;<br />\r\n- some environmental
    constraints, for example audible noise limits, have been added;<br />\r\n- the
    capacitor coupled converters (CCC) and controlled series capacitor converters
    (CSCC) have been included. <strong>This consolidated version consists of the second
    edition (2008), its amendment 1 (2015) and its amendment 2 (2020). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>"
