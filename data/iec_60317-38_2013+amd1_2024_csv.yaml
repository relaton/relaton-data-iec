abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-38:2013+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    round copper winding wire of class 200 with a triple coating. The underlying coating
    is based on polyester or polyesterimide resin, which may be modified providing
    it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all specified
    wire requirements. The secondary coating is based on polyamide-imide resin. The
    third coating is a bonding layer based on a thermoplastic or thermosetting resin.
    NOTE - A modified resin is a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains
    one or more additives to enhance certain performance or application characteristics.
    The range of nominal conductor diameters covered by this part is:<br />\r\n- Grade
    1B: 0,050 mm up to and including 1,600 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2B: 0,050 mm up to
    and including 1,600 mm. The nominal conductor diameters are specified in Clause
    4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 1992, Amendment 1:1997 and Amendment 2:1999. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- new 3.2.2 containing
    general notes on winding wire, formerly a part of the scope;<br />\r\n- revision
    to references to IEC 60317-0-1:2013 to clarify that their application is normative;<br
    />\r\n- new Clause 23, Pin hole test.<br /><br />\r\nKey words: requirements of
    enamelled round copper winding wire, class 200, triple coating"
