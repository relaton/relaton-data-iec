abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18051:2007 specifies the Services and Event Reports for Computer-Supported
    Telecommunications Applications, Phase III (CSTA).</p><p>ISO/IEC 18051:2007 is
    focused on providing application service interfaces to a Switching Function, Computing
    Function and a Special Resource Function. A CSTA application interface is disassociated
    from the various user-network interfaces and network-network interfaces CSTA applications
    may serve, observe or manipulate. Because CSTA operates with existing telecommunications
    interfaces indirectly, it operates generically, so that differences among various
    existing interfaces are hidden from CSTA applications. Support of user-to-network
    interfaces is outside the scope of CSTA.</p><p>Although most terminal equipment
    (TE) is suitable for use with CSTA, there will be instances of TE that will not
    be suitable in certain circumstances. Examples are:</p><ul><li>FAX terminals and
    modems that are unable to adjust their transmission modes to prevent carrier conflict
    when both parties are alerted via CSTA during call establishment;</li><li>functional
    terminals that perform telecommunication functions outside the control of the
    Switching Function.</li></ul><p>Services defined in ISO/IEC 18051:2007 allow functional
    integration between a computing network and a telecommunications network. Computing
    platforms (i.e. application programming interfaces - APIs) that support such functionally-integrated
    applications are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18051:2007.</p><p>Communication
    between the computing and switching (i.e. telecommunications) networks may take
    place via intervening networks ranging from simple point-to-point connections
    to local- or wide-area telecommunications networks.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18051:2007 is
    part of a suite of CSTA Standards and Technical Reports that provide a comprehensive
    description of the architectural and practical issues involved in applying, implementing,
    and utilizing CSTA-based computer telephony integration (CTI) applications.</p>"
