abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18051:2007 specifies the Services and Event Reports for Computer-Supported
    Telecommunications Applications, Phase III (CSTA).<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18051:2007
    is focused on providing application service interfaces to a Switching Function,
    Computing Function and a Special Resource Function. A CSTA application interface
    is disassociated from the various user-network interfaces and network-network
    interfaces CSTA applications may serve, observe or manipulate. Because CSTA operates
    with existing telecommunications interfaces indirectly, it operates generically,
    so that differences among various existing interfaces are hidden from CSTA applications.
    Support of user-to-network interfaces is outside the scope of CSTA.<br /><br />\r\nAlthough
    most terminal equipment (TE) is suitable for use with CSTA, there will be instances
    of TE that will not be suitable in certain circumstances. Examples are:<br /><br
    />\r\nFAX terminals and modems that are unable to adjust their transmission modes
    to prevent carrier conflict when both parties are alerted via CSTA during call
    establishment;<br />\r\nfunctional terminals that perform telecommunication functions
    outside the control of the Switching Function.<br /><br /><br />\r\nServices defined
    in ISO/IEC 18051:2007 allow functional integration between a computing network
    and a telecommunications network. Computing platforms (i.e. application programming
    interfaces - APIs) that support such functionally-integrated applications are
    outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18051:2007.<br /><br />\r\nCommunication between
    the computing and switching (i.e. telecommunications) networks may take place
    via intervening networks ranging from simple point-to-point connections to local-
    or wide-area telecommunications networks.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18051:2007 is
    part of a suite of CSTA Standards and Technical Reports that provide a comprehensive
    description of the architectural and practical issues involved in applying, implementing,
    and utilizing CSTA-based computer telephony integration (CTI) applications."
