  content: "IEC 63260:2020 provides a structured framework for the incorporation of
    human reliability analysis (HRA) into probabilistic risk assessments (PRAs).<br
    />\r\nThis document is to enhance the analysis of human-system interactions in
    PRAs, to help ensure reproducible conclusions, and to standardize the documentation
    of such assessments. To do this, a specific HRA framework is developed from standard
    practices to serve as a benchmark to assess alternative ways of incorporating
    HRA into PRA. This standard is an adoption of IEEE 1082-2017 by IEC."
