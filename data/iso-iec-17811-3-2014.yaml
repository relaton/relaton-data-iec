    <p>ISO/IEC 17811-3:2014 provides the specification of Reliable Message Delivery Protocol (RMDP), which is an application-layer protocol used to provide uniform and reliable message delivery among devices regardless of the underlying network protocols or interfaces.</p>
    <p>The network security is out of scope in this part of ISO/IEC 17811. However, the security services might be necessary according to applications of RMDP. RMDP might suffer from many network-specific threats. To countermeasure those threats, some security mechanism can be deployed.</p>
