  content: "IEC 62290-1:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62290‑1:2025
    provides an introduction to the IEC 62290 series and deals with the main concepts,
    the system definition, the principles and the basic functions of UGTMS (urban
    guided transport management and command/control systems) for use in urban guided
    passenger transport lines and networks. This document is applicable for new lines
    or resignalling of existing lines.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to applications
    using:<br />\r\n- continuous data transmission,<br />\r\n- continuous supervision
    of train movements by train protection profile, and<br />\r\n- localisation of
    trains by onboard UGTMS equipment (reporting trains), and optionally by external
    wayside (and optionally onboard) device.<br />\r\nThe IEC 62290 series specifies
    the functional, system and interface requirements for the command, control, and
    management systems intended to be used on urban, guided passenger transport lines
    and networks.<br />\r\nThese systems are designated herein as urban guided transport
    management and command/control systems (UGTMS). UGTMS cover a wide range of operations
    needs from non-automated (GOA1) to unattended (GOA4) operation. A line may be
    equipped with UGTMS on its full length or only partly equipped.<br />\r\nThe IEC
    62290 series does not specifically address security issues. However, aspects of
    safety requirements may apply to ensuring security within the urban guided transit
    system.<br />\r\nThe main objectives of this series are as follows:<br />\r\n-
    to provide a baseline system description and functional requirements specification
    for a transport authority to use in a request for proposal,<br />\r\n- to provide
    recommendations for those transport authorities wishing to acquire an interoperable
    or interchangeable system.<br />\r\nIt is the responsibility of the transport
    authority concerned to decide on how to apply the IEC 62290 series and to take
    into account their particular needs.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to applications
    using:<br />\r\n- continuous data transmission,<br />\r\n- continuous supervision
    of train movements by train protection profile, and<br />\r\n- localisation of
    trains by onboard UGTMS equipment (reporting trains), and optionally by external
    wayside (and optionally onboard) device.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Figure 3, giving the system
    environment of UGTMS, has been amended to reflect the adaptation of it;<br />\r\nb)
    external equipment for which no requirement is described in the IEC 62290 series
    has been removed;<br />\r\nc) new external equipment having such requirements
    (like the washing machine) has been added."
