abstract:
- content: Providse a standard method of modeling ASICs in VHDL.This method is aimed
    at providing efficient, accurate,and tool independent simulation suitable for
    large chip-level designs typical of those which are based on ASICs. This publication
    has the status of a double logo IEEE/IEC standard
