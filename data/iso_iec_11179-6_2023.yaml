abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11179-6:2023 This document defines the type of information to
    be specified, the conditions to be met, and the procedure(s) to be followed for
    each item to be registered in a metadata registry. The requirements and procedures
    contained herein apply to all types of items specified in ISO/IEC 11179‑3, ISO/IEC
    11179‑31, ISO/IEC 11179‑32, ISO/IEC 11179‑33, ISO/IEC 11179‑35 and those specified
    in ISO/IEC 19763. Some Registration Authorities can use this document to register
    and manage locally defined metadata item types that are not defined in ISO/IEC
    11179 or ISO/IEC 19763.<br />\r\nThis document addresses the common metadata that
    is used to document the common facilities of a registry: administration, identification,
    naming and definition, details that can apply to any and all types of registry
    items.<br />\r\nThis document does not address the metadata that is specific to
    particular types of registry items, such as data elements and value domains. This
    document does not specify the registry's system design, file organization techniques,
    storage media, programming languages, etc. to be used in its implementation."
