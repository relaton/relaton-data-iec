  content: "IEC 60332‑1‑2:2025 specifies the procedure for testing the resistance
    to vertical flame propagation for a single vertical electrical insulated conductor
    or cable, or optical fibre cable, under fire conditions using a 1 kW pre-mixed
    flame. The apparatus is described in IEC 60332‑1‑1.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Testing to
    IEC 60332‑1‑2 can be performed simultaneously with that to IEC 60332‑1‑3, if required.<br
    />\r\nThis group safety publication focusing on test method(s) is primarily intended
    to be used as a product safety standard for the products mentioned in the scope,
    but is also intended to be used by technical committees in the preparation of
    standards for products similar to those mentioned in the scope of this group safety
    publication, in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and
    lSO/lEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The performing of this test method on a single
    insulated conductor or cable or optical fibre cable does not provide compliance
    with fire propagation requirements in relevant standards in the case that the
    single insulated conductor or cable or optical fibre cable is installed with or
    amongst other cables as a group. (See the IEC 60332‑3 series).<br />\r\nOne of
    the responsibilities of a technical committee is, wherever applicable, to make
    use of basic safety publications and/or group safety publications in the preparation
    of its publications."
