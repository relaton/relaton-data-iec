abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60747-5-12:2021(E) discusses the terminology and the measuring
    methods of optoelectronic efficiencies of single light emitting diode (LED) chip
    or package without phosphor. White LEDs for lighting applications are out of the
    scope of this part.<br />\r\nThis technical report provides guidance on<br />\r\n-
    terminology of optoelectronic efficiencies of single LED chip or package without
    phosphor, such as the power efficiency (PE), the external quantum efficiency (EQE),
    the voltage efficiency (VE), the light extraction efficiency (LEE), the internal
    quantum efficiency (IQE), the injection efficiency (IE), and the radiative efficiency
    (RE);<br />\r\n- test methods of optoelectronic efficiencies of the PE, the EQE,
    the VE, the LEE, and the IQE;<br />\r\n- review of various IQE measurement methods
    reported so far in view of accuracy and practical applicability;<br />\r\n- the
    measuring method of the LED IQE based on the temperature-dependent electroluminescence
    (TDEL);<br />\r\n- the measuring method of the LED IQE based on the room-temperature
    reference-point method (RTRM);<br />\r\n- the measuring method of the radiative
    and nonradiative currents of an LED;<br />\r\n- the relationship between the IQE
    and the VE, which leads to introduction of a new LED efficiency, the active efficiency
    (AE) as AE = VE Ã— IQE."
