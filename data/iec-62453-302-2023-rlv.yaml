  content: "IEC 62453-302:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62453-302:2023
    provides information for integrating the CIP™ technology into the FDT interface
    specification (IEC 62453‑2). Communication Profile Family 2 (commonly known as
    CIP™[1]) defines communication profiles based on IEC 61158-2 Type 2, IEC 61158-3-2,
    IEC 61158-4-2, IEC 61158-5-2, IEC 61158-6-2, and IEC 62026-3. The basic profiles
    CP 2/1 (ControlNet™[2]), CP 2/2 (EtherNet/IP™[3]), and CP 2/3 (DeviceNet™1) are
    defined in IEC 61784‑1 and IEC 61784‑2. An additional communication profile (CompoNet™1),
    also based on CIP™, is defined in IEC 62026-7. This part of IEC 62453 specifies
    communication and other services. This specification neither contains the FDT
    specification nor modifies it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[1] CIP™ (Common Industrial
    Protocol), DeviceNet™ and CompoNet™ are trade names of Open DeviceNet Vendor Association,
    Inc (ODVA). This information is given for the convenience of users of this document
    and does not constitute an endorsement by IEC of the trade name holder or any
    of its products. Compliance to this standard does not require use of the trade
    names CIP™, DeviceNet™ or CompoNet™. Use of the trade names CIP™, DeviceNet™ or
    CompoNet™ requires permission of Open DeviceNet Vendor Association, Inc.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\n[2] ControlNet™ is a trade name of ControlNet International, Ltd. This information
    is given for the convenience of users of this document and does not constitute
    an endorsement by IEC of the trademark holder or any of its products. Compliance
    to this profile does not require use of the trade name ControlNet™. Use of the
    trade name ControlNet™ requires permission of ControlNet International, Ltd.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\n[3] EtherNet/IP™ is a trade name of ControlNet International,

    by IEC of the trademark holder or any of its products. Compliance to this profile
