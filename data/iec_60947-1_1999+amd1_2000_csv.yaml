- content: 'Applies, when required by the relevant product standard, to switchgear
    and controlgear hereinafter referred to as "equipment" and intended to be connected
    to circuits, the rated voltage of which does not exceed 1 000 V a.c. or 1 500
    V d.c. It states those general rules and requirements which are common to low-voltage
    equipment as defined in Subclause 1.1, including for example: definitions, characteristics,
    information supplied with the equipment, normal service, mounting and transport
    conditions, constructional and performance requirements, verification of characteristics
    and performance.'
