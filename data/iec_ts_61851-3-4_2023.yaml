abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61851-3-4:2023 This part of IEC 61851, which is a Technical Specification,
    applies to CANopen communication for the conductive transfer of electric power
    between the supply network and an electric road vehicle or a removable rechargeable
    energy storage system (RESS) or on-board rechargeable energy storage systems (RESS)
    of an electric road vehicle.<br />\r\nThe energy management system (EMS) for control
    of power transfer between battery systems and voltage converter units (VCU) provides
    the communication for all devices that can take part in energy management control.<br
    />\r\nThe basic application profile for energy management systems (EMS) consists
    of IEC TS 61851-3-4, IEC TS 61851-3-5, IEC TS 61851-3-6, IEC TS 61851-3-7."
