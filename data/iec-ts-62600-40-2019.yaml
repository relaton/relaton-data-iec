  content: "IEC TS 62600-40:2019 provides uniform methodologies to consistently characterize
    the sound produced by the operation of marine energy converters that generate
    electricity, including wave, current, and ocean thermal energy conversion. This
    document does not include the characterization of sound associated with installation,
    maintenance, or decommissioning of these converters, nor does it establish thresholds
    for determining environmental impacts. Characterization refers to received levels
    of sound at particular ranges, depths, and orientations to a marine energy converter.<br
    />\r\nThe scope of this document encompasses methods and instrumentation to characterize
    sound near marine energy converters, as well as the presentation of this information
    for use by regulatory agencies, industry, and researchers. Guidance is given for
    instrumentation calibration, deployment methods around specific types of marine
    energy converters, analysis procedures, and reporting requirements.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to characterization of sound from individual converters
    and arrays. This document primarily describes measurement procedures for individual
    converters, with extension to arrays discussed in informative Annex."
