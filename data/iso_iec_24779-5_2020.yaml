abstract:
- content: "The ISO/IEC 24779 series of standards focuses on communication with the
    data capture subject.<br />\r\nThis document contains a set of pictograms, icons
    and symbols to help the general public understand the concepts and procedures
    for using electronic systems that collect and/or evaluate facial images. Operators
    can use this document, with the possibility of using additional symbols and information.
    This set of pictograms, icons and symbols is designed to be used to:<br />\r\n-
    identify the type of biometric sensor;<br />\r\n- provide supporting instructions
    related to facial image collection.<br />\r\nTo provide this functionality, the
    set of pictograms, icons and symbols includes both directional pictograms, icons
    and symbols and action or feedback pictograms, icons and symbols. The facial image
    pictograms, icons and symbols include:<br />\r\n- facial image capture;<br />\r\n-
    single person;<br />\r\n- no hat;<br />\r\n- no sunglasses;<br />\r\n- neutral
    expression;<br />\r\n- hair up;<br />\r\n- view direction.<br />\r\nAlthough the
    pictograms, icons and symbols are presented individually, the pictograms, icons
    and symbols are intended to be combined to fully illustrate the facial image capture
    interaction. For example, in a customs or immigration environment, procedures
    constructed from the individual pictograms, icons and symbols could be presented
    as:<br />\r\n- a series of posters while passengers are in the queue;<br />\r\n-
    a series of transitional frames in a biometric booth;<br />\r\n- an animated video
    or series of transitional frames while passengers are in the queue;<br />\r\n-
    instructional leaflets for passengers to read in the queue."
