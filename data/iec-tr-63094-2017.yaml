  content: "IEC TR 63094:2017(E) specifies the line code 4b/10b for dependable multimedia
    signal transmission required for complex machines, such as robots and automobiles.
    This document corresponds to the functions specified in layer 1 to layer 2 of
    the OSI reference model (ISO/IEC 7498).<br />\r\nThe purpose of this document
    is to facilitate the development and use of the 4b/10b in dependable systems by
    providing a line code protocol. This document provides a line code protocol for
    interconnections among distributed real-time systems, including embedded systems,
    control systems, amusement systems, robot systems, and intelligent buildings.
    The 4b/10b can achieve the line code with ECC (error code correction)."
