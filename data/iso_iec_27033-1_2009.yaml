abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 27033-1:2009 provides an overview of network security and related
    definitions. It defines and describes the concepts associated with, and provides
    management guidance on, network security. (Network security applies to the security
    of devices, security of management activities related to the devices, applications/services
    and end-users, in addition to security of the information being transferred across
    the communication links.)</p><p>It is relevant to anyone involved in owning, operating
    or using a network. This includes senior managers and other non-technical managers
    or users, in addition to managers and administrators who have specific responsibilities
    for information security and/or network security, network operation, or who are
    responsible for an organization's overall security program and security policy
    development. It is also relevant to anyone involved in the planning, design and
    implementation of the architectural aspects of network security.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    27033-1:2009 also</p><ul><li>provides guidance on how to identify and analyse
    network security risks and the definition of network security requirements based
    on that analysis,</li><li>provides an overview of the controls that support network
    technical security architectures and related technical controls, as well as those
    non-technical controls and technical controls that are applicable not just to
    networks,</li><li>introduces how to achieve good quality network technical security
    architectures, and the risk, design and control aspects associated with typical
    network scenarios and network “technology” areas (which are dealt with in detail
    in subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 27033), and</li><li>briefly addresses the issues
    associated with implementing and operating network security controls, and the
    on-going monitoring and reviewing of their implementation.</li></ul><p>Overall,
    it provides an overview of the ISO/IEC 27033 series and a “road map” to all other
    parts.</p>"
