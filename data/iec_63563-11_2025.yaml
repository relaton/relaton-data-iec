abstract:
- content: "IEC 63563-11:2025 describes Magnetic power profile (MPP) which is a protocol
    extension that provides additional messages, new power states/modes, new power
    transfer contract elements, and aims to provide the following functionalities:<br
    />\r\n• Operating Frequency Negotiation<br />\r\n• Cloaking (Power Pause)<br />\r\n•
    Generic Information Exchange<br />\r\n• Simultaneous Data Stream Transactions<br
    />\r\n• Fast PTx to PRx communication<br />\r\n• Maximum Power and Power Control
    Profiles Determination<br />\r\n• Extended Power Negotiation<br />\r\n• Extended
    PTx/PRx Identification and Capabilities<br />\r\n• Extended Control Error Packets
    and Received Power Packets<br />\r\n• Power Transmitter Battery Level Reporting<br
    />\r\n• Ecosystem Scalability<br />\r\nMPP extension allows devices to operate
    under Restricted mode (no PTx communication) at 360kHz without performing any
    explicit negotiation with the Power Transmitter. This flexibility enables devices
    with limited resources (e.g., devices with no FSK support) to take advantage of
    the frequency change feature."
