abstract:
- content: "IEC 60286-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60286-5:2018 describes
    the common dimensions, tolerances and characteristics of the tray. It includes
    only those dimensions that are essential for the handling of the trays for the
    stated purpose and for placing or removing components from the trays. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- The generic rules for the design of matrix trays are given
    in this document. Newly developed trays which follow these rules will not be listed
    individually. Only those trays which conform to the design rules set forth herein
    are classified as \"standard trays\" and are thus preferred for use.<br />\r\n-
    An update of the matrix trays, which do not conform to the design rules set forth
    herein, are considered as \"non-standard trays\" and are not preferred for use,
    is listed in Annex A.</p>"
