abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20117:2004 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Message Centre
    Monitoring supplementary service (SS-MCM) as well as the Mailbox Identification
    supplementary service (SS-MID) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated
    services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nThe supplementary service MCM enables a Served
    User to get informed by a Message Centre about the status and status changes of
    messages stored in that Served Users Mailbox.<br />\r\nThe supplementary service
    MID enables a Message Centre to identify a specific mailbox of a Served User in
    case the Served User has more than one mailbox within the Message Centre. In addition
    SS-MID enables a Served User to authenticate himself/herself at a specific mailbox
    located within the Messages Centre.<br />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined
    in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced in three stages
    and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International Standard
    contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the
    requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 20116.<br
    />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-MCM and SS-MID uses certain aspects of the
    generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC
    11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 20117:2004 also specifies additional signalling protocol
    requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between
    SS-MCM as well as SS-MID and other supplementary services and ANFs."
