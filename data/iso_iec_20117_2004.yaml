abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 20117:2004 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Message Centre Monitoring supplementary service (SS-MCM) as well as the
    Mailbox Identification supplementary service (SS-MID) at the Q reference point
    between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>The supplementary service
    MCM enables a Served User to get informed by a Message Centre about the status
    and status changes of messages stored in that Served Users Mailbox.</p><p>The
    supplementary service MID enables a Message Centre to identify a specific mailbox
    of a Served User in case the Served User has more than one mailbox within the
    Message Centre. In addition SS-MID enables a Served User to authenticate himself/herself
    at a specific mailbox located within the Messages Centre.</p><p>The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International
    Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    20116.</p><p>The signalling protocol for SS-MCM and SS-MID uses certain aspects
    of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 20117:2004 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between SS-MCM as well as SS-MID and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p>"
