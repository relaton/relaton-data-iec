  content: This document specifies the sequence of methods for characterizing the
    structural properties of graphene, bilayer graphene and graphene nanoplatelets
    from powders and liquid dispersions using a range of measurement techniques typically
    after the isolation of individual flakes on a substrate. The properties covered
    are the number of layers/thickness, the lateral flake size, the level of disorder,
    layer alignment and the specific surface area. Suggested measurement protocols,
    sample preparation routines and data analysis for the characterization of graphene
    from powders and dispersions are given.
