abstract:
- content: "IEC 61591:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61591:2023 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61591:2019
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 59K experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61591:2023 applies to cooking fume extractors incorporating a
    fan for the recirculation or extraction mode situated in a household kitchen.
    It can also be used for cooking fume extractors where the fan is mounted separately
    from the appliance, but controlled by the appliance when the fan is defined in
    the technical documentation (e.g. name plate data) and instructions for installation.
    This document deals also with down-draft systems arranged beside, behind or under
    the cooking appliance. This document defines the main performance characteristics
    of these appliances, which are of interest to the user, and specifies methods
    for measuring these characteristics. This document does not specify a classification
    or ranking for performance. This document does not deal with safety requirements
    that are in accordance with IEC 60335-1 and IEC 60335-2-31. Cooking fume extractors
    without fans operated by a central ventilation system are covered in EN 13141-3.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) new definition of working point, see 3.19;<br />\r\nb) new definition
    for lowest setting and automatic setting, see 3.17 and 3.18;<br />\r\nc) revised
    requirements for installation and positioning, see 6.2;<br />\r\nd) added a normative
    reference ISO 5801 for the specification of the pressure compensation chamber,
    see Clause 10;<br />\r\ne) separate clauses for determining the volumetric airflow
    and fluid dynamic efficiency, see Clauses 10 and 11;<br />\r\nf) new approach
    for determining the fluid dynamic efficiency (\"9-point calculation\");<br />\r\ng)
    new definitions, new clause and new Annex B regarding the measurement of low-power
    modes;<br />\r\nh) new Annex A: assumption for the parameter b."
