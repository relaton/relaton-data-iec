  content: "IEC TS 62565-4-4:2025 which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine a blank detail specification (BDS) for<br />\r\n-
    quantum dot enabled light conversion film (Q-LCF).<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    to be used for nano-enabled photoelectric display, based on liquid crystal display
    (LCD).<br />\r\nThe relevant key control characteristics (KCC) of Q-LCF are listed,
    including physical, mechanical and optical properties, and stability. For each
    KCC, measurement methods and existing standards are reported.<br />\r\nNumeric
    values for the KCCs are left blank as they will be specified between customer
    and supplier in the detail specification (DS). In the DS KCCs can be added or
    removed if agreed between customer and supplier."
