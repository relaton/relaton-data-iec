abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29176:2011 specifies a consumer privacy-protection protocol for
    Mobile RFID services. It provides a technical solution for addressing privacy
    concerns with tagged items for consumers.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 29176:2011 focuses
    on tag-to-interrogator communications for providing a consumer privacy-protection
    solution. Interrogator-to-host and host (back-end enterprise) system security
    issues are not within the scope of ISO/IEC 29176:2011, but are covered by a variety
    of other best-practice documents."
