abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC 60502-1:2021 is available as IEC 60502-1:2021 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC 60502-1:2021 specifies
    the construction, dimensions and test requirements of power cables with extruded
    solid insulation for rated AC voltages of 1 kV (Um = 1,2 kV) and 3 kV (Um = 3,6
    kV) for fixed installations such as distribution networks or industrial installations.
    Cables of rated AC voltage 1 kV (Um = 1,2 kV) designed and tested in accordance
    with this document can also be used, if declared by the manufacturer, in DC distribution
    systems having their nominal voltage ≤ 750 V DC (with a maximum of 900 V DC) between
    a live conductor and neutral/earth, or ≤ 1 500 V DC (with a maximum 1 800 V DC)
    between two live conductors. Applicable core identification for DC systems are
    considered in accordance with local installation regulations."
