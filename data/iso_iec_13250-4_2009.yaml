abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13250-4:2009 defines a format known as Canonical XTM, or CXTM
    for short. The format is an XML format, and has the property that it guarantees
    that two equivalent Topic Maps Data Model instances (ISO/IEC 13250-2) will always
    produce byte-by-byte identical serializations, and that non-equivalent instances
    will always produce different serializations. CXTM thus enables direct comparison
    of two topic maps to determine equality by comparison of their canonical serializations.
    The purpose of CXTM is to allow the creation of test suites for various Topic
    Maps-related technologies that are easily portable between different Topic Maps
    implementations, so long as these support CXTM. CXTM is not<em></em>intended to
    be used for the interchange of topic maps, although this is possible. The standard
    format for interchange of topic maps is XTM (ISO/IEC 13250-3).</p><p>ISO/IEC 13250-4:2009
    specifies how CXTM files are produced from topic maps by means of a transformation
    from the Topic Maps Data Model (ISO/IEC 13250-2)<em></em>to the XML Infoset.</p>"
