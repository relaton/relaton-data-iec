abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-28:2017(E) establishes the procedure for testing, evaluating,
    and classifying devices and microcircuits according to their susceptibility (sensitivity)
    to damage or degradation by exposure to a defined field-induced charged device
    model (CDM) electrostatic discharge (ESD). All packaged semiconductor devices,
    thin film circuits, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices, opto-electronic devices,
    hybrid integrated circuits (HICs), and multi-chip modules (MCMs) containing any
    of these devices are to be evaluated according to this document. To perform the
    tests, the devices are assembled into a package similar to that expected in the
    final application. This CDM document does not apply to socketed discharge model
    testers. This document describes the field-induced (FI) method. An alternative,
    the direct contact (DC) method, is described in Annex I.<br />\r\nThe purpose
    of this document is to establish a test method that will replicate CDM failures
    and provide reliable, repeatable CDM ESD test results from tester to tester, regardless
    of device type. Repeatable data will allow accurate classifications and comparisons
    of CDM ESD sensitivity levels."
