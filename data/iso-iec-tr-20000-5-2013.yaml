    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 is an exemplar implementation plan providing guidance on how to implement a service management system (SMS) to fulfil the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. The intended users of ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 are service providers, but it can also be useful for those advising service providers on how to implement an SMS.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 includes advice for service providers on a suitable order in which to plan, implement and improve an SMS using, as an example, a generic three-phased approach to manage the implementation. The service provider can choose their own sequence to implement the SMS. Also included is advice on the development of a business case, the project initiation and other activities that are recommended for the implementation to be successful.</p>
    <p>The phases described in ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 do not include changes to the intended scope of the service provider's SMS. The scope itself is not subject to phased changes as a result of adopting the advice in ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013. Instead, each phase should improve the SMS in alignment with the service provider's agreed scope, building on the results of the previous phase.</p>
    <p>The main activities for the development of the business case and initiation of the implementation project are shown. The main activities to implement the SMS based on ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011, in three phases, are listed. Many of the activities described in ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2013 are intended to be met by actions over more than one phase, with each phase building upon the achievements of the earlier phase. Once the final phase is completed, the service provider's organization can achieve the benefits of an SMS that meets the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. Supporting information for the SMS implementation project is also provided.</p>
    <p>Examples of policies to illustrate what a service provider can want to put in place are provided. Because policies depend on the organization and the strategy of the service provider, these example policies can be tailored to suit the organizational requirement.</p>
    <p>Guidance on documentation management is provided, and templates are included for some of the documents specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 that can be amended to suit individual circumstances. </p>
