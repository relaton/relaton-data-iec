abstract:
- content: "IEC 61500:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61500:2018
    establishes requirements for data communication which is used in systems performing
    category A functions in nuclear power plants. It covers also interface requirements
    for data communication of equipment performing category A functions with other
    systems including those performing category B and C functions and functions not
    important to safety. This document gives requirements for functions and properties
    of on-line plant data communication by reference to IEC 60880 and IEC 60987, produced
    within the framework of IEC 61513. It requires categorisation of the communication
    functions in accordance with IEC 61226. This new edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    the changes introduced to previously referenced standards have been confirmed
    to apply;<br />\r\n- relevant newly published standards have been referenced;<br
    />\r\n- lessons learned from several industrial applications have been incorporated."
