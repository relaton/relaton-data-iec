abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63019:2019 provides a framework from which the availability metrics
    of a PVPS can be derived and reported. It describes how data are categorized and
    defines generic information categories to which time can be assigned for a PVPS
    considering internal and external conditions based on fraction of time, system
    health, and condition by specifying the following:<br />\r\n- generic information
    categories of a PVPS considering availability and production.<br />\r\n- information
    category priority to discriminate between concurrent categories.<br />\r\n- entry
    and exit point for each information category to allocate designation of time.<br
    />\r\nThe PVPS comprises all photovoltaic (PV) modules, inverters, DC and AC collection
    systems, grid interconnection equipment, the site, its infrastructure, and all
    functional service elements. Formulas in this document provide normative guidance
    for standardization. Beyond that, it is not the intention of this document to
    specify exactly how other undefined, time-based availability metrics shall be
    calculated. The annexes are examples and guiding principles for developing methods
    for calculation and estimation of availability metrics, subject to the knowledge
    and concurrence for use by the involved stakeholders. Estimates and calculations
    also have recommendations on how they are to be used as part of the informative
    function."
