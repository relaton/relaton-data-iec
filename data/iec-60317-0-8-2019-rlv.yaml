    specifies the general requirements of polyester glass-fibre wound fused, unvarnished,
    or resin or varnish impregnated bare, or grade 1 or grade 2 or enamelled rectangular
    copper winding wires. The range of nominal conductor dimensions is given in 4.1

    the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision to the title of the standard indicating
    that the glass fibre covering is fused and unvarnished;<br />\r\n- revision to
    subclause 3.2 adding winding wire requirements for the fibrous covering and a
    list of covering classifications;<br />\r\n- revision to subclause 3.3 requirements
    for appearance;<br />\r\n- revision to subclause 8.2, adherence test requirements.<br
