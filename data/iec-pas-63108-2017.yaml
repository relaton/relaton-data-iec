  content: "IEC PAS 63108:2017 specifies the requirements of primary DC distribution
    systems and interconnected installations.<br />\r\nThe requirements of this PAS
    establish general principles for<br />\r\n- operations, without degrading unit
    and human safety, capable of a reduced environmental footprint,<br />\r\n- existing
    and new power generating units, new DC distribution concepts for electrical power,
    energy storage and advanced control of a total power balance, including semiconductor
    converters (AC to DC, DC to DC and DC to AC power converters) and dynamic load
    controllers, and<br />\r\n- relevant system studies and calculations demonstrating
    a protection philosophy as needed for necessary selectivity, segregation methods
    and equipment.<br />\r\nThis PAS also gives guidelines for integration of energy
    sources of different nature and suitable ways to identify locations of such installations."
