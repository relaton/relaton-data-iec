abstract:
- content: "IEC 60077-4:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60077-4:2019 gives rules
    for AC circuit-breakers, the main contacts of which are connected to AC overhead
    contact lines; the nominal voltage of these circuits being in accordance with
    IEC 60850. This document, together with IEC 60077-2, states specifically:<br />\r\na)
    the characteristics of the circuit-breakers;<br />\r\nb) the service conditions
    with which circuit-breakers comply with reference to:<br />\r\n- operation and
    behaviour in normal service;<br />\r\n- operation and behaviour in short-circuit;<br
    />\r\n- dielectric properties;<br />\r\nc) the tests for confirming the compliance
    of the components with the characteristics under the service conditions and the
    methods to be adopted for these tests<br />\r\nd). the information to be marked
    on, or given with the circuit-breaker.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition, issued in 2003. This edition includes the following
    main technical changes with regard to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) standard
    values of transient recovery voltages and test procedure are reviewed;<br />\r\nb)
    procedure of verification of temperature rise is changed;<br />\r\nc) air-tightness
    test as type test, insulation resistance measurement are added</p>"
