  content: "IEC 61439-4:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61439-4:2023
    defines the specific requirements of ACS as follows:<br />\r\n- assemblies for
    which the rated voltage does not exceed 1 000 V in case of AC or 1 500 V in case
    of DC;<br />\r\n- assemblies where the nominal primary voltage and the nominal
    secondary voltage of transformers incorporated in ACS are within the limits specified
    above;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for use on construction sites, both indoors
    and outdoors, i.e. temporary places of work to which the public do not generally
    have access and where building construction, installation, repairs, alteration
    or demolition of property (buildings) or civil engineering (public works) or excavation
    or any other similar operations are carried out;<br />\r\n- transportable (semi-fixed)
    or mobile ASSEMBLIES with enclosure.<br />\r\nThis second edition of IEC 61439-4
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 61439-1:2020
