abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-209:2022 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62271-209:2022 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62271-1:2017+AMD1:2021 CSV and IEC 62271-203:2011.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-209:2019+AMD1:2022
    covers the connection assembly of fluid-filled and extruded cables to gas-insulated
    metal enclosed switchgear (GIS), in single- or three-phase arrangements where
    the cable terminations are fluid-filled or dry-type and there is a separating
    insulating barrier between the cable insulation and the gas insulation of the
    switchgear. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) New numbering in accordance with ISO/IEC directives, Part 2 (2016) and
    to IEC 62271â€‘1:2017;<br />\r\nb) Clause 3: addition of a definition for plug-in
    cable termination, filling pressure and minimum function pressure for insulation;<br
    />\r\nc) Clause 7: An additional dielectric type test for plug-in cable termination
    was added; also a pressure type test as well as a leak rate test on the insulator
    of a cable termination was implemented;<br />\r\nd) Clause 12: New clause about
    safety practices;<br />\r\ne) Clause 13: New clause about influence of the product
    on the environment;<br />\r\nf) New informative Annex A: Mechanical forces applied
    on the flange of the cable connection enclosure."
