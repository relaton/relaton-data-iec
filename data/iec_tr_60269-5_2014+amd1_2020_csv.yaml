abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60269-5:2014+A1:2020 serves as an application guide for low-voltage
    fuses, shows how current-limiting fuses are easy to apply to protect today's complex
    and sensitive electrical and electronic equipment. This guidance specifically
    covers low-voltage fuses up to 1 000 V a.c. and 1 500 V d.c. designed and manufactured
    in accordance with IEC 60269 series. This guidance provides important facts about
    as well as information on the application of fuses. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- recommendations for fuse operations
    in high altitudes added,<br />\r\n- more details for operational voltages added,<br
    />\r\n- recommendations for photovoltaic system protection added,<br />\r\n- numerous
    details improved Keywords: application guide for low-voltage fuses, current-limiting
    fuses<br /><strong>This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2014)
    and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong>"
