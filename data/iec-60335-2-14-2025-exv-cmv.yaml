    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-14:2025 deals with the safety of electric kitchen
    machines for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more
    than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within the scope of this
    standard are<br />\r\n– bean slicers;<br />\r\n– auger juicers;<br />\r\n– blenders;<br
    />\r\n– can openers;<br />\r\n– centrifugal juicers;<br />\r\n– churns;<br />\r\n–
    citrus-fruit squeezers;<br />\r\n– coffee mills not exceeding a hopper rated capacity
    of 500 g;<br />\r\n– cream whippers;<br />\r\n– egg beaters;<br />\r\n– food mixers;<br
    />\r\n– food processors;<br />\r\n– grain grinders not exceeding a hopper rated
    capacity of 3 l;<br />\r\n– graters;<br />\r\n– ice-cream machines, including
    those for use in refrigerators and freezers;<br />\r\n– knife sharpeners;<br />\r\n–
    knives;<br />\r\n– mincers;<br />\r\n– noodle makers;<br />\r\n– peelers;<br />\r\n–
    shredders;<br />\r\n– sieving machines;<br />\r\n– slicing machines.<br />\r\nAppliances
    intended for normal household and similar use and that can also be used by laypersons
    in shops, in light industry, bed and breakfast and on farms, are within the scope
    of this standard. However, if the appliance is intended to be used professionally
    to process food for commercial consumption, the appliance is not considered to
    be for household and similar use only.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances which are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nIt does not take into account the use of the following
    appliances by children:<br />\r\n– bean slicers;<br />\r\n– blenders including
    hand-held blenders;<br />\r\n– juicers other than citrus-fruit squeezers;<br />\r\n–
    food mixers;<br />\r\n– food processors;<br />\r\n– knives;<br />\r\n– mincers;<br
    />\r\n– noodle makers;<br />\r\n– lathe-type or hand-held peelers;<br />\r\n–
    vegetable graters/shredders;<br />\r\n– slicing machines.<br />\r\nAttention is
    drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n–
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– slicing
    machines having a circular knife the blade of which is inclined at an angle exceeding
    45° to the vertical;<br />\r\n– breadmakers (IEC 60335 2 9);<br />\r\n– soy milk
    makers (IEC 60335 2 15);<br />\r\n– food waste disposers (IEC 60335 2 16);<br
    />\r\n– ice-cream appliances with incorporated motor compressors (IEC 60335-2
    24);<br />\r\n– kitchen machines intended for commercial purposes (IEC 60335 2
    64);<br />\r\n– kitchen machines intended for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n–
    kitchen machines intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in
    2016 and Amendment 1:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 3.1.9.111, 3.1.9.112, 3.1.9.114, 3.1.9.115,
    11.7.3, 20.2, 20.107, 20.108);<br />\r\nc) modification to replace berry juice
    extractor with auger juicer and addition of a defined term (Clause 1, 3.1.9.101,
    3.5.107, 11.7.102, 19.1, 19.7);<br />\r\nd) addition of requirements for appliances
    not intended for use by children (Clause 1, 7.12, 20.2, 20.106, 20.117);<br />\r\ne)
    modifications to clarify the testing under normal operating conditions (3.1.9,
    3.1.9.111, 5.9, 7.12, 10.1, 11.5, 11.6, 11.7, 11.7.1 to 11.7.3, 11.7.101 to 11.7.118);<br
    />\r\nf) addition of surface temperatures for external accessible surfaces (11.3,
    11.8);<br />\r\ng) modification of the spillage test of 15.2 to address leakage
    from the liquid container;<br />\r\nh) clarification of requirements for remote
    operation of kitchen machines (11.7, 19.7, 22.40, 22.49, 22.51);<br />\r\ni) modification
    of the operating period for juicers with respect to the 0,5 kg carrot load and
    the operating time (11.7.105);<br />\r\nj) clarification of overfill testing with
    detachable gaskets and addition of gasket leakage test (15.2, 15.102);<br />\r\nk)
    clarification of the feed opening dimension limits in 20.2;<br />\r\nl) addition
    of requirements when compliance with the standard relies on an electronic circuit
    for the interlock function (20.2, 20.104, 20.108, 20.113);<br />\r\nm) addition
    of test probe 18 where test probe B is applied and clarification of forces applied
    to test probes (20.2, 20.104, 20.106, 20.108, 20.113, 20.114, 20.117);<br />\r\nn)
    update and combine requirements for inadvertent operation of hand-held blenders
    and knives to cover alternative switch constructions on the market (20.103 and
    deletion of previous 20.115);<br />\r\no) clarification of the test of 20.104;<br
    />\r\np) update of interlock requirements to be applicable for all appliances
    where the interlock is required for compliance with the standard (20.113, 20.114);<br
    />\r\nq) update of the detergent used for centrifugal juicer conditioning (Annex
    AA).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
