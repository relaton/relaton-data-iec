abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62348:2012(E) which is a technical report, provides a tool to assist
    users of IEC 60601-1:2005 to assess the impact of the most significant changes
    in Amendment 1:2012. This technical report also provides a tool to assist users
    of IEC 60601-1 to trace requirements between the third edition and their source
    in the documents that form the basis of the third edition; principally the second
    edition as amended. This report is intended to be used by:<br />\r\n- those who
    must align standards based on the second edition of IEC 60601-1 with the third
    edition as amended;<br />\r\n- manufacturers of medical electrical equipment or
    medical electrical systems; and<br />\r\n- health care regulatory authorities,
    test houses and other organizations responsible for implementing standards for
    medical electrical equipment and medical electrical systems. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2006. The second edition retains
    the mapping that traces the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 and its Amendment
    A1:2012 (Edition 3.1) from their source in the documents that relate to IEC 60601-1:1998
    and its amendments (Edition 2.2). The second edition adds an assessment of the
    impact of the most significant changes in Amendment 1:2012."
