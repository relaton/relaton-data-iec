abstract:
- content: "IEC 60350-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60350-2:2025
    defines methods for measuring the performance of electric hobs for household use.
    Appliances covered by this document can be built-in or designed to be placed on
    a work surface. The hob can be part of a cooking range and it can have an integrated
    cooking fume extractor, i.e. a hob with down-draft system. This document defines
    the main performance characteristics of hobs which are of interest to the user
    and specifies methods for measuring these characteristics. This document does
    not specify a classification or ranking for performance. Some of the tests which
    are specified in this document are not considered to be reproducible since the
    results can vary between laboratories. They are therefore intended for comparative
    testing purposes only. This document does not deal with safety requirements (IEC
    60335-2-6 and IEC 60335-2-9). This document is also applicable for portable appliances
    with similar functionality. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2017 and Amendment 1:2021. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) new definitions for portable
    hob, hob with down-draft system and low power modes are amended in Clause 3;<br
    />\r\nb) revision of Clause 5: Tolerance for water amount added, requirements
    for dimension measurement added;<br />\r\nc) removal of 6.4 Level of solid hotplates;<br
    />\r\nd) revision of Clause 7 in order to improve the application of the smoothing
    average;<br />\r\ne) revision of Table 1 and Table 3 in order to amend missing
    tolerances:<br />\r\nf) Ry replaced by L* in Clause 9 and reference to IEC TS
    63350;<br />\r\ng) requirements for digital assessment in 9.1.6 removed as they
    are covered in IEC TS 63350;<br />\r\nh) revision of Clause 12 Power measurement
    of low power modes;<br />\r\ni) removal of Clause 13 Spillage capacity of hobs;<br
    />\r\nj) Annex G Low-power mode measurements added;<br />\r\nk) removal of Annex
    D 'Shade chart' as the shade charts are specified in IEC TS 63350;<br />\r\nl)
    removal of Annex E 'Data and calculation sheet' as the calculation sheet is substituted
    by a<br />\r\nsupporting document located on the IEC web site;<br />\r\nm) update
    of former Annex F 'Addresses of suppliers' by removal of former Clause F.6, F.7
    and F.8 and by adding a further possible supplier in new D.4"
