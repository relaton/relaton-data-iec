abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19540-1:2022 There are four parts to this specification, two are
    normative and two informative. The normative parts are:<br />\r\n1) The UAF Domain
    Metamodel (DMM) (this document) that provides the definition of concepts, relationships
    and viewpoints for the framework. The UAF DMM is the basis for any implementation
    of UAF including non-UML/SysML implementations.<br />\r\n2( The UAF Profile (UAFP)
    (see document dtc/19-06-15) is a UML/SysML implementation of the UAF DMM<br />\r\nThe
    informative parts are:<br />\r\n3) The UAF Traceability, Annex A (see document
    dtc/19-06-17), which details the mappings between the UAF and the various frameworks
    and languages that contribute to the UAF.<br />\r\n4) The UAF Example Model, Annex
    B (see document dtc/19-06-18), which illustrates a practical usage of UAF."
