abstract:
- content: IEC 63004:2015(E) the scope is the development of a common receiver fixture
    interface (RFI) specification that is based upon available commercial standards
    integrated under a common open architecture. This mechanical/electrical interface
    is intended to serve government/commercial interest for applications in test,
    system integration, manufacturing, monitoring, and other functional requirements
    that demand large contact densities and quick-disconnect mechanical operation.
