- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document specifies the purpose
    and content of all identified systems and software life‐cycle and service management
    information items (documentation). The information item contents are defined according
    to generic document types, as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose
    of the document, as presented in Clause 10.</p><p>This document assumes an organization
    is performing life‐cycle processes, or delivering system or software engineering
    services, using either or both of the following:</p><p>— ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
    software life cycle processes;</p><p>— ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 system life cycle
    processes.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 define an
    Information Management process, but do not "detail information items in terms
    of name, format, explicit content, and recording media" (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017,
    1.4). These standards identify, recommend or require a number of documentation
    items. This document provides a mapping of processes from the above standards
    to a set of information items. It provides a consistent approach to meeting the
    information and documentation requirements of systems and software engineering
    and engineering service management.</p><p>The generic document types defined in
    this document are used to identify the information necessary to support the processes
    required by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. The generic document
    types (which can be referred to as information item types) are used to identify
    the information necessary to support the processes.</p><p>For each life‐cycle
    process or service, it would be possible to prepare a policy, plan, procedures
    and reports, as well as numerous records, requests, descriptions and specifications.
    Such an elaboration of the documentation schema would be more rigorous than specified
    by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. As ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015,
    1.4 points out, "The users of this document are responsible for selecting a life
    cycle model for the project and mapping the processes, activities, and tasks in
    this document into that model. The parties are also responsible for selecting
    and applying appropriate methodologies, methods, models and techniques suitable
    for the project." Thus, information items are combined or subdivided consistent
    with the life cycle model, as needed for project or organizational purposes, as
    further defined in Clause 4 and Clause 5.</p><p>This document is not a management
    system standard and does not establish a service management system, quality management
    system, or asset management system. The scope of this document does not include
    the following:</p><p>a) the format or content of recommended input data or input
    information items, except for the content of those input items that are also output
    information items;</p><p>b) instructions on combining or subdividing information
    items and information item contents of a similar nature;</p><p>c) guidance on
    selecting an appropriate presentation format, delivery media and maintenance technology
    for systems or software life‐cycle data, records, information items or documentation,
    such as electronic publishing systems, content management systems or data repositories;</p><p>NOTE
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531 provides requirements for content management and component
    content management systems. ISO/IEC 26514 provides guidance on formats for user
    documentation (information for users).</p><p>d) detailed content for information
    items related to general business, contractual, organizational and financial management
    that is not specific to systems and software engineering and engineering service
    management, such as business strategies, contract change notices (agreement change
    report), human resources and investment policies, personnel selection criteria,
    financial budgeting and accounting policies and procedures, cost reports, or payroll
    data;</p><p>e) information items showing only approval of an ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
    or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 subclause, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.10.3
    c) 3);</p><p>f) any ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 subclause
    not explicitly or implicitly identifying the recording of information about a
    process, activity or task, for example, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.2.4.3 c);</p><p>g)
    work products, models, software, and other artifacts of life‐cycle products and
    services that are not information items or records used in information items.</p>
