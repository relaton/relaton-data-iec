abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2019 This document specifies the purpose and content
    of all identified systems and software life‐cycle and service management information
    items (documentation). The information item contents are defined according to
    generic document types, as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of
    the document, as presented in Clause 10.<br />\r\nThis document assumes an organization
    is performing life‐cycle processes, or delivering system or software engineering
    services, using either or both of the following:<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
    software life cycle processes;<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 system life
    cycle processes.<br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015
    define an Information Management process, but do not \"detail information items
    in terms of name, format, explicit content, and recording media\" (ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017, 1.4). These standards identify, recommend or require a number of documentation
    items. This document provides a mapping of processes from the above standards
    to a set of information items. It provides a consistent approach to meeting the
    information and documentation requirements of systems and software engineering
    and engineering service management.<br />\r\nThe generic document types defined
    in this document are used to identify the information necessary to support the
    processes required by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015. The
    generic document types (which can be referred to as information item types) are
    used to identify the information necessary to support the processes.<br />\r\nFor
    each life‐cycle process or service, it would be possible to prepare a policy,
    plan, procedures and reports, as well as numerous records, requests, descriptions
    and specifications. Such an elaboration of the documentation schema would be more
    rigorous than specified by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015.
    As ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, 1.4 points out, \"The users of this document are responsible
    for selecting a life cycle model for the project and mapping the processes, activities,
    and tasks in this document into that model. The parties are also responsible for
    selecting and applying appropriate methodologies, methods, models and techniques
    suitable for the project.\" Thus, information items are combined or subdivided
    consistent with the life cycle model, as needed for project or organizational
    purposes, as further defined in Clause 4 and Clause 5.<br />\r\nThis document
    is not a management system standard and does not establish a service management
    system, quality management system, or asset management system. The scope of this
    document does not include the following:<br />\r\na) the format or content of
    recommended input data or input information items, except for the content of those
    input items that are also output information items;<br />\r\nb) instructions on
    combining or subdividing information items and information item contents of a
    similar nature;<br />\r\nc) guidance on selecting an appropriate presentation
    format, delivery media and maintenance technology for systems or software life‐cycle
    data, records, information items or documentation, such as electronic publishing
    systems, content management systems or data repositories;<br />\r\nNOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE
    26531 provides requirements for content management and component content management
    systems. ISO/IEC 26514 provides guidance on formats for user documentation (information
    for users).<br />\r\nd) detailed content for information items related to general
    business, contractual, organizational and financial management that is not specific
    to systems and software engineering and engineering service management, such as
    business strategies, contract change notices (agreement change report), human
    resources and investment policies, personnel selection criteria, financial budgeting
    and accounting policies and procedures, cost reports, or payroll data;<br />\r\ne)
    information items showing only approval of an ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2015 subclause, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.10.3 c) 3);<br />\r\nf)
    any ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 subclause not explicitly
    or implicitly identifying the recording of information about a process, activity
    or task, for example, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.2.4.3 c);<br />\r\ng) work products,
    models, software, and other artifacts of life‐cycle products and services that
    are not information items or records used in information items."
