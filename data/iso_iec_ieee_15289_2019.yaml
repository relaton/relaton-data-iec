abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies the purpose and content of all identified systems
    and software life‐cycle and service management information items (documentation).
    The information item contents are defined according to generic document types,
    as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of the document, as presented
    in Clause 10.</p><p>This document assumes an organization is performing life‐cycle
    processes, or delivering system or software engineering services, using either
    or both of the following:</p><p>— ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 software life cycle
    processes;</p><p>— ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 system life cycle processes.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 define an Information Management process,
    but do not "detail information items in terms of name, format, explicit content,
    and recording media" (ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 1.4). These standards identify,
    recommend or require a number of documentation items. This document provides a
    mapping of processes from the above standards to a set of information items. It
    provides a consistent approach to meeting the information and documentation requirements
    of systems and software engineering and engineering service management.</p><p>The
    generic document types defined in this document are used to identify the information
    necessary to support the processes required by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2015. The generic document types (which can be referred to as information
    item types) are used to identify the information necessary to support the processes.</p><p>For
    each life‐cycle process or service, it would be possible to prepare a policy,
    plan, procedures and reports, as well as numerous records, requests, descriptions
    and specifications. Such an elaboration of the documentation schema would be more
    rigorous than specified by ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015.
    As ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, 1.4 points out, "The users of this document are responsible
    for selecting a life cycle model for the project and mapping the processes, activities,
    and tasks in this document into that model. The parties are also responsible for
    selecting and applying appropriate methodologies, methods, models and techniques
    suitable for the project." Thus, information items are combined or subdivided
    consistent with the life cycle model, as needed for project or organizational
    purposes, as further defined in Clause 4 and Clause 5.</p><p>This document is
    not a management system standard and does not establish a service management system,
    quality management system, or asset management system. The scope of this document
    does not include the following:</p><p>a) the format or content of recommended
    input data or input information items, except for the content of those input items
    that are also output information items;</p><p>b) instructions on combining or
    subdividing information items and information item contents of a similar nature;</p><p>c)
    guidance on selecting an appropriate presentation format, delivery media and maintenance
    technology for systems or software life‐cycle data, records, information items
    or documentation, such as electronic publishing systems, content management systems
    or data repositories;</p><p>NOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531 provides requirements for
    content management and component content management systems. ISO/IEC 26514 provides
    guidance on formats for user documentation (information for users).</p><p>d) detailed
    content for information items related to general business, contractual, organizational
    and financial management that is not specific to systems and software engineering
    and engineering service management, such as business strategies, contract change
    notices (agreement change report), human resources and investment policies, personnel
    selection criteria, financial budgeting and accounting policies and procedures,
    cost reports, or payroll data;</p><p>e) information items showing only approval
    of an ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 subclause, such as ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017, 6.4.10.3 c) 3);</p><p>f) any ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 or ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017 subclause not explicitly or implicitly identifying the recording of
    information about a process, activity or task, for example, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017,
    6.2.4.3 c);</p><p>g) work products, models, software, and other artifacts of life‐cycle
    products and services that are not information items or records used in information
    items.</p>
