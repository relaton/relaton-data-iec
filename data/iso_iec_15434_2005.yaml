abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15434:2005 defines the manner in which data is transferred
    to high-capacity ADC media from a supplier's information system and the manner
    in which data is transferred to the recipient's information system. ISO/IEC 15434:2005
    does not define the internal data storage format for specific high-capacity ADC
    media. ISO/IEC 15434:2005 does not specify the application of data structures
    provided by a specific data syntax format. The application of the data structure
    is specified by industry conventions.</p><p>Users of automatic data capture (ADC)
    technologies benefit by being able to receive data in a standard form and by being
    able to provide data in a standard form. Static ADC technologies such as bar code
    symbologies, magnetic stripe, optical character recognition, surface acoustical
    wave (SAW), and Weigand effect typically encode a single field of data. Most applications
    of these technologies involve the encoding of a single field of data by the supplier
    of the medium and the subsequent decoding of the data field by the recipient.
    Encoding single fields of data permits the supplier to perform the encodation
    from a single field within the supplier's information system. Decoding single
    fields of data permits the recipient to input this data into a single field in
    the recipient's information system, in lieu of key entry.</p><p>High-capacity
    ADC technologies, such as two-dimensional symbols, RFID transponders, contact
    memories, and smart cards, encode multiple fields of data. These multiple fields
    usually are parsed by the recipient's information system and then mapped to specific
    fields of data in the recipient's information system. ISO/IEC 15434:2005 defines
    the syntax for high-capacity ADC media, so as to enable ADC users to utilize a
    single mapping utility, regardless of which high-capacity ADC media is employed.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15434:2005 specifies a transfer structure, syntax, and coding of messages and
    data formats when using high-capacity ADC media between trading partners (specifically
    between suppliers and recipients) and, where applicable, in support of carrier
    applications, such as bills of lading and carrier sortation and tracking.</p><p>The
    data encoded according to ISO/IEC 15434:2005 includes</p><ul><li>data which may
    be used in the shipping, receiving, and inventory of transport units;</li><li>data
    which may be contained within supporting documentation, in paper or electronic
    form, related to unit loads or transport packages;</li><li>data which may be used
    in the sortation and tracking of transport units.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 15434:2005
    describes the ISO 646 syntax for automatic data capture.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15434:2005
    is not the controlling specification for data structures (e.g. CII) referenced
    in ISO/IEC 15434:2005.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15434:2005 does not supersede or replace
    any applicable safety or regulatory marking or labelling requirements. ISO/IEC
    15434:2005 is to be applied in addition to any other mandated labelling requirements.</p>"
