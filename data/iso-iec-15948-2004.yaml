  content: <p>ISO/IEC 15948:2004 specifies a datastream and an associated file format,
    Portable Network Graphics (PNG, pronounced "ping"), for a lossless, portable,
    compressed individual computer graphics image transmitted across the Internet.
    Indexed-colour, greyscale, and truecolour images are supported, with optional
    transparency. Sample depths range from 1 to 16 bits. PNG is fully streamable with
    a progressive display option. It is robust, providing both full file integrity
    checking and simple detection of common transmission errors. PNG can store gamma
    and chromaticity data as well as a full ICC colour profile for accurate colour
    matching on heterogenous platforms. ISO/IEC 15948:2004 defines the Internet Media
    type "image/png". The datastream and associated file format have value outside
    of the main design goal.</p>
