abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    23736-4:2020 This specification, EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1, defines
    a file format and processing model for encapsulating the set of related resources
    that comprise an EPUBÂ® Publication into a single-file container.<br />\r\nThis
    specification is one of a family of related specifications that compose EPUB 3,
    the third major revision of an interchange and delivery format for digital publications
    based on XML and Web Standards. It is meant to be read and understood in concert
    with the other specifications that make up EPUB 3:<br />\r\nThe EPUB 3 Overview
    [EPUB3Overview], which provides an informative overview of EPUB and a roadmap
    to the rest of the EPUB 3 documents. The Overview should be read first.<br />\r\nEPUB
    Publications 3.0.1 [Publications301], which defines the semantics and overarching
    conformance requirements for each Rendition of an EPUB Publication.<br />\r\nEPUB
    Content Documents 3.0.1 [ContentDocs301], which defines profiles of XHTML, SVG
    and CSS for use in the context of EPUB Publications.<br />\r\nEPUB Media Overlays
    3.0.1 [MediaOverlays301], which defines a format and a processing model for synchronization
    of text and audio.<br />\r\nOCF is the required container technology for EPUB
    Publications. OCF may play a role in the following workflows:<br />\r\nDuring
    the preparation steps in producing an EPUB Publication, OCF may be used as the
    container format when exchanging an in-progress EPUB Publication between different
    individuals and/or different organizations.<br />\r\nWhen providing an EPUB Publication
    from publisher or conversion house to the distribution or sales channel, OCF is
    the recommended container format to be used as the transport format.<br />\r\nWhen
    delivering the final EPUB Publication to an EPUB Reading System or User, OCF is
    the required format for the container that holds all of the assets that make up
    the EPUB Publication.<br />\r\nThe OCF specification defines the rules for structuring
    the file collection in the abstract: the \"abstract container\". It also defines
    the rules for the representation of this abstract container within a ZIP archive:
    the \"physical container\". The rules for ZIP physical containers build upon the
    ZIP technologies used by [ODF]. OCF also defines a standard method for obfuscating
    embedded resources, such as fonts, for those EPUB Publications that require this
    functionality.<br />\r\nThis specification supersedes Open Container Format (OCF)
    3.0 [OCF30]. Refer to [EPUB3Changes] for information on differences between this
    specification and its predecessor."
