  content: "IEC 60317-61:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60317-61:2020
    specifies the requirements of polyester glass-fibre wound, resin or varnish impregnated
    bare, grade 1 or grade 2 enamelled rectangular copper winding wires, temperature
    index 180. The impregnating agent can be, for instance, epoxy, polyester, or polyesterimide
    resin based. NOTE For this type of wire, the heat shock test is inappropriate
    and therefore a heat shock temperature cannot be established. Consequently, a
    class based on the requirements for temperature index and heat shock temperature
    cannot be specified. The range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this
    document is:<br />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness:
    min. 0,80 mm max. 5,60 mm.<br />\r\nThe specified combinations of width and thickness
    as well as the specified width/thickness ratio are according to IEC 60317-0-8.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    revision of the title of the standard;<br />\r\n- revision to Clause 1, Scope;<br
    />\r\n- revision to the descriptions of grades of thickness of polyester glass-fibre
    coverings in 3.2.2."
