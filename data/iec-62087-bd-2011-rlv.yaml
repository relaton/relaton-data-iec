  content: "IEC 62087:2011 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62087:2011 specifies
    methods of measurement for the power consumption of television sets, video recording
    equipment, set top boxes, audio equipment and multifunction equipment for consumer
    use. Television sets include, but are not limited to, those with CRT, LCD, PDP
    or projection technologies. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision. The main changes
    with respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n- Clause 8 is expanded.<br
    />\r\n- Annex D and Annex E are added.<br />\r\nFurthermore methods for measuring
    power consumption of set top boxes mainly in the modes of on mode and standby-active,
    high mode are revised. This publication contains attached files in the form of
    DVDs and Blu-ray, as indicated in the Bibliography. These files are intended to
    be used as a complement and do not form an integral part of this standard.<br
    />\r\nNote that the video content on DVDs and BD is identical to those of the
    previous edition of 2008.<br />\r\nThis publication is available in CD-ROM format
    only. The 4-disc package contains the publication and video files on a CD-ROM,
    two DVD-ROMs and a Blu-ray™ Disc."
