abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes interface specifications for the implementation
    of a driving licence in association with a mobile device. This document specifies
    the interface between the mDL and mDL reader and the interface between the mDL
    reader and the issuing authority infrastructure. This document also enables parties
    other than the issuing authority (e.g. other issuing authorities, or mDL verifiers
    in other countries) to:</p><p>— use a machine to obtain the mDL data;</p><p>—
    tie the mDL to the mDL holder;</p><p>— authenticate the origin of the mDL data;</p><p>—
    verify the integrity of the mDL data.</p><p>The following items are out of scope
    for this document:</p><p>— how mDL holder consent to share data is obtained;</p><p>—
    requirements on storage of mDL data and mDL private keys.</p>"
