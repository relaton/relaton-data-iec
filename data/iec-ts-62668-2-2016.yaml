  content: IEC TS 62668-2:2016(E) defines requirements for avoiding the use of counterfeit,
    recycled and fraudulent components when these components are not purchased from
    the original component manufacturer (OCM) or are purchased from outside of franchised
    distributor networks for use in the aerospace, defence and high performance (ADHP)
    industries. This practice is used, as derogation, only when there are no reasonable
    or practical alternatives. Although developed for the ADHP industry, this document
    may be used by other high-performance and high-reliability industries, at their
    discretion.
