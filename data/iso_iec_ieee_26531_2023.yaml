abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 26531:2023 This document specifies requirements for efficient
    development and management of information produced<br />\r\n- throughout the life
    cycle of a system and software product;<br />\r\n- for the provision of information
    for users of systems and software;<br />\r\n- for the management of IT and support
    services.<br />\r\nThis document is independent of the tools, protocols, and systems
    used for content management. It does not address configuration management of software
    assets.<br />\r\nThe content management process presented in Clauses 6 to 10 is
    a specialization (lower-level process) of the information management process specified
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207."
