  content: "IEC TS 62898-3-2:2024 provides technical requirements for the operation
    of energy management systems of microgrids. This document applies to utility-interconnected
    or islanded microgrids. This document describes specific recommendations for low-voltage
    (LV) and medium-voltage (MV) systems.<br />\r\nThis document focuses on developing
    standards of energy management systems aimed for microgrids integrated in decentralized
    energy systems or public distribution grids. It concerns some particularities
    that are not totally covered by the existing conventional energy system. The microgrid
    energy management systems are being studied by various actors (utilities, manufacturers,
    and energy providers) on actual demonstration projects and application use case.
    The aims of this document are to make the state of the art of existing energy
    management systems used in actual microgrids projects, to classify the relevant
    functions which can be accomplished by microgrid energy management systems, and
    to recommend necessary technical requirements for energy management systems of
    future microgrids.<br />\r\nThis document includes the following items:<br />\r\n•
    main performances of key components of microgrid: decentralized energy resources,
    energy storages and controllable loads),<br />\r\n• description of main functions
    and topological blocks of microgrid energy management systems (MEMS),<br />\r\n•
    specification of information exchange protocol between main function blocks, linked
    to microgrid monitoring and control systems (MMCS).<br />\r\nMain functions of
    MEMS:<br />\r\n• power and energy management among different resources within
    microgrid including active and reactive power flows with different time scales,<br
    />\r\n• power and energy forecasts of microgrid,<br />\r\n• energy balancing between
    upstream grid and microgrid energy resources according to power and energy forecast
    and upstream and local constraints,<br />\r\n• economic and environmental optimization,<br
    />\r\n• possible service capacities such as capacity market auctions and resiliency
    anticipation: new business models,<br />\r\n• data archiving, trending, reporting
    and evaluation of operation capacities in various operation modes.<br />\r\nMEMS
    can have some other additional functions according to microgrid size and actual
    application cases:<br />\r\n• tariff and market trading management,<br />\r\n•
    utility ancillary services such as frequency regulation, voltage regulation, power
    quality and reliability improvement, demand response possibilities, change of
    operation modes linked to MMCS."
