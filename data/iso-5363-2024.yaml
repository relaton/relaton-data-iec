  content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />This document specifies test methods
    for the exoskeleton-type walking RACA robot used as medical electrical equipment
    which is intended to move from one location to another, by making reciprocating
    motion having intermittent contact with the travel surface.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not apply to passive or non-powered exoskeletons.<br />\r\nNOTE These tests
    can be used to verify conformity with the requirements of IEC 80601-2-78."
