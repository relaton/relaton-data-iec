abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-21:2006 describes a lightweight programmatic environment
    for advanced interactive multi-media applications. Designed for limited resources
    devices such as mobile phones, Graphics Framework eXtenstions (GFX) offer a framework
    that marries a subset of the MPEG standard Java application environment (MPEG-J)
    with a Java API for accessing 3D renderers, and with other standard Java APIs
    from a selected profile. The framework enables developers to create applications
    that combine MPEG audio and video streams, with 3D graphics rendering and user
    interaction. Applications can use advanced special effects in the graphics presentation
    such as mapping video as a texture.<br /><br />\r\nGFX applications, also called
    MPEGlets, follow the well-known design of MIDlets on J2ME platforms and reuse
    familiar media APIs from these platforms such as JSR-135 Mobile Media API. On
    the rendering side, GFX provides a pluggable renderer architecture that allows
    use of renderers such as Java bindings to OpenGL ES (JSR-239) or Mobile 3D Graphics
    (JSR-184). By allowing choice of low-level rendering APIs, developers are free
    to design optimized rendering algorithms for the needs of their applications and
    use dedicated application-specific formats for their assets, as do all highly
    interactive applications.<br /><br />\r\nReusing existing mobile APIs, most Java
    applications currently used on mobile devices may be easily ported to a system
    using GFX. A GFX implementation is an ultra-thin layer of several class and interface
    definitions over standard Java and MPEG-J APIs. When added to any existing Java
    graphics API, the overhead is minimal."
