abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-4-9:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-9:2016 specifies
    the immunity requirements, test methods, and range of recommended test levels
    for equipment subjected to impulse magnetic disturbances mainly encountered in
    industrial installations, power plants, railway installations, and medium voltage
    and high voltage sub-stations. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 1993 and Amendment 1:2000. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision."
