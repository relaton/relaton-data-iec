  content: "IEC 61010-2-081:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-081:2015
    applies to automatic and semi-automatic laboratory equipment for analysis and
    other purposes. Automatic and semi-automatic laboratory equipment consists of
    instruments or systems for measuring or modifying one or more characteristics
    or parameters of samples, performing the complete process or parts of the process
    without manual intervention. Equipment forming part of such a system is within
    the scope of this standard. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2003. It constitutes a technical revision and includes the
    following significant changes from the first edition, as well as numerous other
    changes:<br />\r\n- excluded IEC 61010-2-101 (IVD Equipment) from scope. This
    separates IEC 61010-2-081 and IEC 61010-2-101 equipment;<br />\r\n- added biological
    risks symbol to Table 1 in Clause 5;<br />\r\n- added requirement for statement
    on hazardous substances and gases in Instructions for Use to Clause 5;<br />\r\n-
    Added marking requirement for flow direction to Clause 5;<br />\r\n- added requirement
    for OPERATOR maintenance instructions to Clause 7;<br />\r\n- excluded equipment
    whose size and weight make unintentional movement unlikely from drop test in Clause
    8;<br />\r\n- added requirement for biohazard marking to Clause 13;<br />\r\n-
    added requirement for interlock systems containing electric/electronic or programmable
    components to Clause 15.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
