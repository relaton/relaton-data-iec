  content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />The VMEbus specification defines
    an interfacing system used to interconnect microprocessors, data storage and peripheral
    control devices in a closely-coupled hardware configuration. Its objectives include
    allowing communication between devices on the VMEbus without disturbing the internal
    activities of other devices on the VMEbus, allowing a broad range of design latitude
    so that the designer can optimize cost and&#x2F;or performance without affecting
    system compatibility, and providing a system where performance is primarily device-limited
    rather than system-interface-limited.</br>\r\n</br>\r\nNote that this publication
    is available not in paper form but as a CD-ROM."
