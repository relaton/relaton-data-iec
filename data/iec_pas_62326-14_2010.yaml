abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 62326-14:2010(E) is applicable to device embedded substrates fabricated
    by embedding discrete active and passive electronic devices into an inner layer
    of a substrate with electric connections by vias, conductor plating, conductive
    paste, and printing. The device embedded substrate may be used as a substrate
    to mount SMDs to form electronic circuits, as conductor and insulator layers may
    be formed after embedding electronic devices. The purpose of this PAS is to obtain
    common understanding in design, fabrication and use of device embedded substrates
    in the industry. This PAS describes the substrate embedding devices including
    but not limited to module, integrated passive device (IPD), microelectrochemical
    systems (MEMS), discrete component formed in the fabrication process of the electronic
    wiring board, and sheet form component. This PAS does not specify the fabrication
    process of device embedded substrates, via diameter/via land diameter, conductor
    width/conductor spacing nor conductor line density.
