abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 10373-6:2016 defines test methods for characteristics of identification
    cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced
    to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the
    supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed
    in identification card applications.<p>NOTE 1 Criteria for acceptability do not
    form part of ISO/IEC 10373-6:2016, but will be found in the International Standards
    mentioned above.</p><p>NOTE 2 Test methods defined in ISO/IEC 10373-6:2016 are
    intended to be performed separately. A given proximity card or object, or proximity
    coupling device, is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    10373-6:2016 defines test methods which are specific to proximity cards and objects,
    and proximity coupling devices and proximity extended devices, defined in ISO/IEC
    14443‑1, ISO/IEC 14443‑2, ISO/IEC 14443‑3, and ISO/IEC 14443‑4.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    10373‑1 defines test methods which are common to one or more integrated circuit
    card technologies and other parts deal with other technology‑specific tests.</p>
