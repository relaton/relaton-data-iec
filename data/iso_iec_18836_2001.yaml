abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of
    an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to enable physical interchange of such cartridges
    between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recording
    method and the recorded format called MammothTape-2, and thereby allowing data
    interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.<br />\r\nInformation
    interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the
    interchange parties upon the interchange code(s) and the specifications of the
    structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge."
