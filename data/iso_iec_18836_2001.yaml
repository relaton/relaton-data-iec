abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to</p><p>enable physical interchange of
    such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the</p><p>recording method and the recorded format called MammothTape-2,
    and thereby allowing data interchange between drives by</p><p>means of such magnetic
    tape cartridges.</p><p>Information interchange between systems also requires,
    at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the</p><p>interchange
    code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information
    on the interchanged cartridge.</p>"
