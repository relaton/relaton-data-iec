- content: IEC TS 62840-1:2016(E) gives the general overview for battery swap systems,
    for the purposes of swapping batteries of electric road vehicles (EVs) when the
    vehicle powertrain is turned off and when the battery swap system is connected
    to the supply network at standard supply voltages according to IEC 60038 with
    a rated voltage up to 1 000 V AC and up to 1 500 V DC. It is applicable for battery
    swap systems for EV equipped with one or more swappable battery system (SBS).
