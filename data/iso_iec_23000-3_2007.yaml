abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 specifies a solution for digital photo library applications.
    It standardizes the packaging of images and associated metadata, enabling interoperable
    exchange across diverse devices and platforms. The supported metadata include
    image-acquisition parameters (such as date, time and camera settings), as well
    as MPEG-7 visual content descriptions. This allows conforming devices to support
    new content-enhanced functionality such as intelligent browsing, content-based
    search or automatic categorization.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 makes
    it possible to<br /><br />\r\norganize photos into categories based on their content
    - for example, the people and places depicted, or events taking place in photos;<br
    />\r\nperform advanced content-based searches through collections of photos;<br
    />\r\nbundle photos and favourite ways to show them, into a single MPEG-4 file;<br
    />\r\nlink to external resources such as other images (outside the MPEG-4 file)
    or web-pages.<br /><br /><br />\r\nThe major components of ISO/IEC 23000-3:2007
    are<br /><br />\r\na method to encapsulate a set of JPEG compressed images in
    an MPEG-4 file;<br />\r\nconcise subsets of MPEG-7 metadata to describe the individual
    images and the overall collection;<br />\r\na method to embed this binary MPEG-7
    metadata in the MPEG-4 file.<br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 is a response
    to the need for persistent and interoperable linking of digital image collections
    with metadata in order to support advanced access to content. It offers a flexible
    solution for applications ranging from consumer digital photography to advertising
    and e-commerce."
