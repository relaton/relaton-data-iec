    29341-11-12:2008 enables modeling of QoS Policy Holder function capabilities.
    The functionality for the QoS Policy Holder service can be implemented by any
    device on the home network. The QoS Policy Holder service is responsible for providing
    the traffic policy values for any given traffic stream as requested by an entity
    that manages home network traffic, typically a QoS Management Entity. The series
    of ISO/IEC 29341 publications defines an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer
    network connectivity of intelligent appliances, wireless devices and PCs. It is
    designed to bring easy to use, flexible, standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc
    or unmanaged networks whether in the home, in a small business, public spaces
    or attached to the Internet."
