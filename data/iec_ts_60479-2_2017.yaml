abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC TS 60479-2:2017 is also available as IEC TS 60479-2:2017
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br
    />\r\nIEC TS 60479-2:2017 describes the effects on the human body when a sinusoidal
    alternating current in the frequency range above 100 Hz passes through it. This
    document describes the effects of current passing through the human body in the
    form of single and multiple successive unidirectional rectangular impulses, sinusoidal
    impulses and impulses resulting from capacitor discharges. This basic safety publication
    is primarily intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards
    in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide
    51."
