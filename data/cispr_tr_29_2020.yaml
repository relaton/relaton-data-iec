abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->CISPR TR 29:2020 is available as CISPR TR 29:2020 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nCISPR
    TR 29:2020, which is a technical report, describes the algorithms used for objective
    picture assessment in immunity tests of analogue and digital TV broadcast receivers
    and associated equipment. The algorithms used were developed on the basis of the
    specifications originally included in Annex K of CISPR 20:2002/AMD2:2004, the
    later edition of which has been replaced by CISPR 35:2016. The method of objective
    picture assessment described in that annex employs the same interference mechanism
    and is based on the same wanted signal definition as specified in CISPR 35 for
    subjective picture assessment. Objective picture assessment, therefore, constitutes
    an alternative to the subjective method and offers the advantage of direct correlation
    to the subjective method. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- update of the references, and<br />\r\n- editorial improvements."
