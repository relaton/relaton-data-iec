abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    23736-6:2020 This specification, EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier (epubcfi),
    defines a standardized method for referencing arbitrary content within an EPUBÂ®
    Publication through the use of fragment identifiers.<br />\r\nThe Web has proven
    that the concept of hyperlinking is tremendously powerful, but EPUB Publications
    have been denied much of the benefit that hyperlinking makes possible because
    of the lack of a standardized scheme to link into them. Although proprietary schemes
    have been developed and implemented for individual Reading Systems, without a
    commonly-understood syntax there has been no way to achieve cross-platform interoperability.
    The functionality that can see significant benefit from breaking down this barrier,
    however, is varied: from reading location maintenance to annotation attachment
    to navigation, the ability to point into any Publication opens a whole new dimension
    not previously available to developers and Authors.<br />\r\nThis specification
    attempts to rectify this situation by defining an arbitrary structural reference
    that can uniquely identify any location, or simple range of locations, in an EPUB
    Publication: the EPUB CFI. The following considerations have strongly influenced
    the design and scope of this scheme:<br />\r\nThe mechanism used to reference
    content should be interoperable: references to a reading position created by one
    Reading System should be usable by another.<br />\r\nDocument references to EPUB
    content should be enabled in the same way that existing hyperlinks enable references
    throughout the Web.<br />\r\nEach location in an EPUB file should be able to be
    identified without the need to modify the document.<br />\r\nAll fragment identifiers
    that reference the same logical location should be equal when compared.<br />\r\nComparison
    operations, including tests for sorting and comparison, should be able to be performed
    without accessing the referenced files.<br />\r\nSimple manipulations should be
    possible without access to the original files (e.g., given a reference deep in
    a file, it should be possible to generate a reference to the start of the file).<br
    />\r\nIdentifier resolution should be reasonably efficient (e.g., processing of
    the first chapter is not necessary to resolve a fragment identifier that points
    to the last chapter).<br />\r\nReferences should be able to recover their target
    locations through parser variations and document revisions.<br />\r\nExpression
    of simple, contiguous ranges should be supported.<br />\r\nAn extensible mechanism
    to accommodate future reference recovery heuristics should be provided.<br />\r\nIn
    the case of both Standard EPUB CFIs and Intra-Publication EPUB CFI, this specification
    conforms with the guidelines expressed by W3C in Section 6. Best Practices for
    Fragid Structures [FragIDBestPractices].<br />\r\nIn other words, both standard
    CFI URIs (e.g., \"book.epub#epubcfi(?)\", referred media type \"application/epub+zip\")
    and intra-publication CFI URIs (e.g., \"package.opf#epubcfi(?)\", referred media
    type \"application/oebps-package+xml\") make use of a fragment identifier syntax
    that does not overlap with existing schemes in the context of the aforementioned
    media types' suffix registrations (i.e., \"-xml\" and \"zip\")."
