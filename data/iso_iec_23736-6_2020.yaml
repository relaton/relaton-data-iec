abstract:
- content: '<p>This specification, EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier (epubcfi), defines
    a standardized method for referencing arbitrary content within an EPUBÂ® Publication
    through the use of fragment identifiers.</p><p>The Web has proven that the concept
    of hyperlinking is tremendously powerful, but EPUB Publications have been denied
    much of the benefit that hyperlinking makes possible because of the lack of a
    standardized scheme to link into them. Although proprietary schemes have been
    developed and implemented for individual Reading Systems, without a commonly-understood
    syntax there has been no way to achieve cross-platform interoperability. The functionality
    that can see significant benefit from breaking down this barrier, however, is
    varied: from reading location maintenance to annotation attachment to navigation,
    the ability to point into any Publication opens a whole new dimension not previously
    available to developers and Authors.</p><p>This specification attempts to rectify
    this situation by defining an arbitrary structural</p><p>reference that can uniquely
    identify any location, or simple range of locations, in an EPUB Publication: the
    EPUB CFI. The following considerations have strongly influenced the design and
    scope of this scheme:</p><p>The mechanism used to reference content should be
    interoperable: references to a reading position created by one Reading System
    should be usable by another.</p><p>Document references to EPUB content should
    be enabled in the same way that existing hyperlinks enable references throughout
    the Web.</p><p>Each location in an EPUB file should be able to be identified without
    the need to modify the document.</p><p>All fragment identifiers that reference
    the same logical location should be equal when compared.</p><p>Comparison operations,
    including tests for sorting and comparison, should be able to be performed without
    accessing the referenced files.</p><p>Simple manipulations should be possible
    without access to the original files (e.g., given a reference deep in a file,
    it should be possible to generate a reference to the start of the file).</p><p>Identifier
    resolution should be reasonably efficient (e.g., processing of the first chapter
    is not necessary to resolve a fragment identifier that points to the last chapter).</p><p>References
    should be able to recover their target locations through parser variations and
    document revisions.</p><p>Expression of simple, contiguous ranges should be supported.</p><p>An
    extensible mechanism to accommodate future reference recovery heuristics should
    be provided.</p><p>In the case of both Standard EPUB CFIs and Intra-Publication
    EPUB CFI, this specification conforms with the guidelines expressed by W3C in
    Section 6. Best Practices for Fragid Structures [FragIDBestPractices].</p><p>In
    other words, both standard CFI URIs (e.g., "book.epub#epubcfi(?)", referred media
    type "application/epub+zip") and intra-publication CFI URIs (e.g., "package.opf#epubcfi(?)",
    referred media type "application/oebps-package+xml") make use of a fragment identifier
    syntax that does not overlap with existing schemes in the context of the aforementioned
    media types'' suffix registrations (i.e., "-xml" and "zip").</p>'
