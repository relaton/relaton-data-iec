  content: "IEC 60730-2-11:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60730-2-11:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60730-1:2022.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60730-2-11:2025 applies to energy
    regulators<br />\r\n• for use in, on, or in association with equipment for household
    appliance and similar use;<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Throughout this document, the word
    \"equipment\" means \"appliance and equipment\" and \"controls\" means \"energy
    regulators\".<br />\r\n• for equipment that is used by the public, such as equipment
    intended to be used in shops, offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial
    applications;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 1  Energy regulators for commercial catering, heating
    and air-conditioning equipment.<br />\r\n• that are smart enabled energy regulators;<br
    />\r\nEXAMPLE 2 Smart grid control, remote interfaces/control of energy-consuming
    equipment including computer or smart phone.<br />\r\n• that are AC or DC powered
    controls with a rated voltage not exceeding 690 V AC or 600 V DC;<br />\r\n• used
    in, on, or in association with equipment that use electricity, gas, oil, solid
    fuel, solar thermal energy, etc., or a combination thereof;<br />\r\n• utilized
    as part of a control system or controls which are mechanically integral with multifunctional
    controls having non-electrical outputs;<br />\r\n• using NTC or PTC thermistors
    and to discrete thermistors, requirements for which are contained in Annex J;<br
    />\r\n• that are mechanically or electrically operated, responsive to or controlling
    such characteristics as temperature, pressure, passage of time, humidity, light,
    electrostatic effects, flow, or liquid level, current, voltage, acceleration,
    or combinations thereof;<br />\r\n• as well as manual controls when such are electrically
    and/or mechanically integral with automatic controls.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Requirements
    for manually actuated mechanical switches not forming part of an automatic control
    are contained in IEC 61058-1-1.<br />\r\nThis document applies to<br />\r\n- the
    inherent safety of energy regulators, and<br />\r\n- functional safety of energy
    regulators of low complexity safety related systems and controls,<br />\r\n- controls
    where the performance (for example the effect of EMC phenomena) of the product
    can impair the overall safety and performance of the controlled system,<br />\r\n-
    the operating values, operating times, and operating sequences where such are
    associated with equipment safety.<br />\r\n- manual energy regulators which are
    electrically and/or mechanically integral with automatic controls.<br />\r\n-
    energy regulators incorporating electronic devices, requirements for which are
    contained in Annex H.<br />\r\n- the electrical and functional safety of controls
    capable of receiving and responding to communications signals, including signals
    for power billing rate and demand response.<br />\r\nThe signals can be transmitted
    to or received from external units being part of the control (wired), or to and
    from external units which are not part of the control (wireless) under test.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies the requirements for construction, operation and
    testing of automatic energy regulators used in, on, or in association with an
    equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not<br />\r\n• apply to automatic energy
    regulators intended exclusively for industrial process applications unless explicitly
    mentioned in the relevant part 2 or the equipment standard. However, this document
    can be applied to evaluate automatic energy regulators intended specifically for
    industrial applications in cases where no relevant safety standard exists.<br
    />\r\n• take into account the response value of an automatic action of an energy
    regulator, if such a response value is dependent upon the method of mounting the
    energy regulator in the equipment. Where a response value is of significant purpose
    for the protection of the user, or surroundings, the value defined in the appropriate
    equipment standard or as determined by the manufacturer will apply.<br />\r\n•
    address the integrity of the output signal to the network devices, such as interoperability
    with other devices unless it has been evaluated as part of the control system.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\nadoption to IEC 60730-1:2022 with all of its significant changes to IEC
    60730-1:2013 IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD1:2015 and IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD2:2020."
