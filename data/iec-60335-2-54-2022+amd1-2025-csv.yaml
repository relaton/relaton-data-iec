  content: "IEC 60335-2-54:2022+A1:2025 deals with the safety of electric cleaning
    appliances for household use that are intended for cleaning surfaces by using
    liquid cleansing agents or steam, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.
    It also covers wallpaper strippers and surface cleaning appliances incorporating
    heating elements or means for pressurizing the liquid container.<br />\r\nAs far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n–
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– floor treatment and wet scrubbing machines
    (IEC 60335-2-10);<br />\r\n– cleaning appliances that are permanently fixed to
    a building;<br />\r\n– cleaning appliances covered by IEC 60335-2-79, namely those
    having a<br />\r\n• pressure exceeding 2,5 MPa;<br />\r\n• pressurised volume
    over 5 l;<br />\r\n• product of pressure (in MPa) and container volume (in l)
    exceeding 5;<br />\r\n• liquid temperature exceeding 160 °C;<br />\r\n• rated
    power input exceeding 3 500 W;<br />\r\n– cleaning appliances intended for commercial
    or industrial use;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where
    special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– fabric steamers (IEC 60335-2-85).<br />\r\nThis
    fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2008, Amendment
    1: 2015 and Amendment 2: 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 15.2, 21.103, 21.105, 22.103);<br
    />\r\nc) addition of external accessible surface temperature limits (3.6.102,
    3.6.103, 7.1, 11.3, 11.8)<br />\r\nd) exception for hand-held appliances (20.1);<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
