abstract:
- content: Development methodologies may be described in the context of an underpinning
    metamodel, but the precise mechanisms that permit them to be defined in terms
    of their metamodels are usually difficult to explain and do not cover all needs.
    For example, it is difficult to devise a practice that allows the definition of
    properties of the elements that compose the methodology and, at the same time,
    of the entities (such as work products) created when the methodology is applied.
    ISO/IEC 24744:2007 introduces the Software Engineering Metamodel for Development
    Methodologies (SEMDM), a comprehensive metamodel that makes use of a new approach
    to defining methodologies based on the concept of powertype. The aim of SEMDM
    is to define methodologies in information-based domains, i.e. areas characterized
    by their intensive reliance on information management and processing, such as
    software, business or systems engineering. The SEMDM combines key advantages of
    other metamodelling approaches with none of their known drawbacks, allowing the
    seamless integration of process, modelling and people aspects of methodologies.
    Examples are given where other metamodels are mapped to SEMDM and a brief synopsis
    of problems is provided.Various methodologies are defined, used, or implied by
    a growing number of standards, and it is desirable that the concepts used by each
    methodology be harmonized. A vehicle for harmonization is the SEMDM. Conformance
    to this metamodel will ensure a consistent approach to defining each methodology
    with consistent concepts and terminology.
