  content: "IEC 62196-1:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62196-1:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 62196-1:2014
    edition 3.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 23H experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62196-1:2022 is
    applicable to EV plugs, EV socket-outlets, vehicle connectors, vehicle inlets,
    herein referred to as \"accessories\", and to cable assemblies for electric vehicles
    (EV) intended for use in conductive charging systems which incorporate control
    means, with a rated operating voltage not exceeding:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">690
    V AC 50 Hz to 60 Hz, at a rated current not exceeding 250 A;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">1
    500 V DC at a rated current not exceeding 800 A.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">This
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2014. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:left\">deletion of references to universal AC and DC interfaces;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:left\">additional requirements for contact materials and plating;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:left\">changes to the temperature rise test to include additional
    points of measurement;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:left\">additional tests
    for accessories to address thermal stresses and stability, mechanical wear and
    abuse, and exposure to contaminants;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:left\">relocation
    of information and requirements for DC charging to IEC 62196-3.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</div>"
