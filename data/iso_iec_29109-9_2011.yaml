abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 specifies a data record interchange format for recording,
    storing, and transmitting one or more hand vascular images. Each image is accompanied
    by image-specific metadata contained in a header record. ISO/IEC 29109-9:2011
    establishes tests for checking the correctness of the binary record. It defines
    a testing methodology to ensure conformance of a vendor's application or service
    to ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007.The objective of ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 cannot be completely
    achieved until biometric products can be tested to determine whether they conform
    to those specifications. Conforming implementations are a necessary prerequisite
    for achieving interoperability among implementations. The conformance test assertions
    will cover, as much as is practical, the ISO/IEC 19794 requirements (covering
    the most critical features), so that the conformity results produced by the test
    suites will reflect the real degree of conformity of the implementations to ISO/IEC
    19794 data interchange format records. This is the motivation for the development
    of this conformance testing methodology.
