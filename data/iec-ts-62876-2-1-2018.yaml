  content: IEC TS 62876-2-1:2018 establishes a general stability testing programme
    to verify the stability of the performance of nanomaterials and nano-enabled photovoltaic
    devices (NePV) devices. These devices are used as subassemblies for the fabrication
    of photovoltaic modules through a combination with other components. This testing
    programme defines standardized degradation conditions, methodologies and data
    assessment for technologies. The results of these tests define a stability under
    standardized degradation conditions for quantitative evaluation of the stability
    of a new technology. The procedures outlined in this document were designed for
    NePV, but can be extended to serve as a guideline for other photovoltaic technologies
    as well.
