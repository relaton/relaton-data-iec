abstract:
- content: "IEC 60904-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60904-3:2016 describes
    basic measurement principles for determining the electrical output of PV devices.
    The principles given in this standard are designed to relate the performance rating
    of PV devices to a common reference terrestrial solar spectral irradiance distribution.
    The reference terrestrial solar spectral irradiance distribution is given in this
    standard in order to classify solar simulators according to the spectral performance
    requirements contained in IEC 60904-9. The principles contained in this standard
    cover testing in both natural and simulated sunlight. This new edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- the direct beam irradiance corresponding to the global irradiance was
    included;<br />\r\n- the term \"Global photon irradiance\" was changed to \"Global
    photon flux\";<br />\r\n- the titles of some clauses have been changed (others
    have been added) in accordance with the usual structure of IEC standards."
