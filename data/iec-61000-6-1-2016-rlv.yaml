  content: "IEC 61000-6-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-6-1:2016 for
    EMC immunity requirements applies to electrical and electronic equipment intended
    for use in residential, commercial, public and light-industrial locations. Immunity
    requirements in the frequency range 0 Hz to 400 GHz are covered. No tests need
    to be performed at frequencies where no requirements are specified. This generic
    EMC immunity standard is applicable if no relevant dedicated product or product-family
    EMC immunity standard exists. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
