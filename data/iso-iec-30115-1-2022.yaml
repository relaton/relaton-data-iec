  content: "<p>This document defines the required protocols, data model, behaviors,
    and other architectural components for an interoperable, multivendor, remote,
    and out-of-band capable interface. This interface meets the cloud-based and web-based
    IT professionals' expectations for scalable platform management. While large and
    hyperscale environments are the primary focus, clients can use the document for
    individual system management.<br />This document defines the required elements
    for all Redfish implementations, and the optional elements that system vendors
    and manufacturers can choose. <br />This document also defines at which points
    an implementation can provide OEM-specific extensions.<br />This document sets
    normative requirements for Redfish services and associated materials, such as
    Redfish schema files. In general, this document does not set requirements for
    Redfish clients but indicates how a client can successfully and effectively access
    and use a Redfish service.<br />This document does not require that implementations
    of the Redfish interfaces and functions require particular hardware or firmware.</p>"
