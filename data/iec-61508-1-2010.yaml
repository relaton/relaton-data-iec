  content: "Looking for deeper insights? Check out <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/22273\">IEC
    61508:2010 CMV</a>, which includes commented versions of Parts 1 to 7 of IEC 61508.
    These commented versions highlight the changes made from previous editions and
    provide explanations from a world-leading expert on the reasons behind the most
    significant changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61508-1:2010 covers those aspects
    to be considered when electrical/electronic/programmable electronic (E/E/PE) systems
    are used to carry out safety functions. A major objective of this standard is
    to facilitate the development of product and application sector international
    standards by the technical committees responsible for the product or application
    sector. This will allow all the relevant factors, associated with the product
    or application, to be fully taken into account and thereby meet the specific needs
    of users of the product and the application sector. A second objective of this
    standard is to enable the development of E/E/PE safety-related systems where product
    or application sector international standards do not exist. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1998. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. It has been subject to a thorough review and incorporates
    many comments received at the various revision stages. It has the status of a
    basic safety publication according to IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication
    is of high relevance for Smart Grid."
