abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20926:2009 specifies the set of definitions, rules and steps for
    applying the IFPUG (International Function Point Users Group) functional size
    measurement (FSM) method.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 20926:2009 is conformant with
    all mandatory provisions of ISO/IEC 14143-1:2007. It can be applied to all functional
    domains and is fully convertible to prior editions of IFPUG sizing methods.<br
    /><br />\r\nIFPUG function point analysts have identified different delivery rates
    (hours to deliver a function point) related to building applications in different
    functional domains calibrated for varying project sizes and software complexities.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 20926:2009 can be applied by anyone requiring a measurement
    of functional size. Persons experienced with the method will find ISO/IEC 20926:2009
    to be a useful reference."
