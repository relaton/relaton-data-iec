abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 7816-11:2022 This document specifies security-related interindustry
    commands that are intended to be used for personal verification through biometric
    methods in integrated circuit cards. It also defines the data structure and data
    access methods for use of the card as a carrier of the biometric reference and/or
    as the device to perform the verification of the cardholder's biometric probe
    (on-card biometric comparison). Identification of persons using biometric methods
    is outside the scope of this document.
