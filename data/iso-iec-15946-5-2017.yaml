    <p>The ISO/IEC 15946 series specifies public-key cryptographic techniques based on elliptic curves described in ISO/IEC 15946‑1.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15946-5:2017 defines elliptic curve generation techniques useful for implementing the elliptic curve based mechanisms defined in ISO/IEC 29192‑4, ISO/IEC 9796‑3, ISO/IEC 11770‑3, ISO/IEC 14888‑3 and ISO/IEC 18033‑2.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15946-5:2017 is applicable to cryptographic techniques based on elliptic curves defined over finite fields of prime power order (including the special cases of prime order and characteristic two). This document is not applicable to the representation of elements of the underlying finite field (i.e. which basis is used).</p>
    <p>The ISO/IEC 15946 series does not specify the implementation of the techniques it defines. Interoperability of products complying with the ISO/IEC 15946 series will not be guaranteed.</p>
