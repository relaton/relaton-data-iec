abstract:
- content: "IEC 62872-1:2019(E) defines the interface, in terms of information flow,
    between industrial facilities and the “smart grid”. It identifies, profiles and
    extends where required, the standards needed to allow the exchange of the information
    needed to support the planning, management and control of electric energy flow
    between the industrial facility and the smart grid.<br />\r\nThe scope of this
    document specifically excludes the protocols needed for the direct control of
    energy resources within a facility where the control and ultimate liability for
    such control is delegated by the industrial facility to the external entity (e.g.
    distributed energy resource (DER) control by the electrical grid operator)."
