abstract:
- content: '<p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 on "Contours: Technology Domain" describes
    the system functions and DAVIC</p><p>tools relevant to the Contours defined in
    ISO/IEC TR 165001. A goal of this part of ISO/IEC 16500 is to guide</p><p>implementers
    to those parts of ISO/IEC 16500 which are relevant for the implementation of the
    systems in each</p><p>Contour and to show the relation between the various tools.
    Another goal of this specification is to state which</p><p>specific DAVIC tools
    have to be implemented to realize interoperable system components.</p><p>As the
    underlying trade-off between system component cost and service revenue may vary
    considerably, e.g., by</p><p>geographical location and time, this trade-off is
    deemed to be outside of the scope of DAVIC and hence a more</p><p>detailed "micro
    profiling" of the tool set needs to be agreed upon between the various parties
    involved with the</p><p>realization of a system. An STB that is fully interoperable
    with, for example, Enhanced Broadcast Services within</p><p>a certain geographical
    area, can be designed by implementing all defined DAVIC tools used by the Enhanced</p><p>Broadcast
    Services in that area.</p><p>In order to assist the above mentioned micro-profiling
    activity the DAVIC tools relevant to a specific Contour</p><p>have been structured
    in the following way. A collection of DAVIC tools (sub/clauses of ISO/IEC 16500)
    which</p><p>together realize a complete system function (e.g., the reliable transmission
    of synchronized multimedia</p><p>information) are grouped together. The group
    is identified as "system function". For each of these groups an</p><p>overall
    informative description is given and a table listing in detail the included DAVIC
    tools. For the tools</p><p>dependencies are indicated if applicable. The functional
    requirements derived from the User &amp; Market Domain of</p><p>a contour (see
    ISO/IEC TR 16501) are fully mapped to the above list of system functions.</p>'
