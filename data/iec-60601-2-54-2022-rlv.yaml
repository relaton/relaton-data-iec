  content: "IEC 60601-2-54:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-54:2022
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of ME EQUIPMENT and ME SYSTEMS
    intended to be used for projection RADIOGRAPHY and INDIRECT RADIOSCOPY. IEC 60601-2-43
    applies to ME EQUIPMENT and ME SYSTEMS intended to be used for interventional
    applications and refers to applicable requirements in this document. ME EQUIPMENT
    and ME SYSTEMS intended to be used for bone or tissue absorption densitometry,
    computed tomography, mammography or dental or radiotherapy applications are excluded
    from the scope of this document. The scope of this document also excludes radiotherapy
    simulators. If a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable
    to ME EQUIPMENT only, or to ME SYSTEMS only, the title and content of that clause
    or subclause will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies
    both to ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS, as relevant. IEC 60601-2-54:2022 edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009, Amendment 1:2015 and
    Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes editorial and technical changes to reflect the IEC 60601 1:2005/AMD2:2020.
    It also contains corrections and technical improvements. Significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\na) a new
    specific term DOSIMETER is introduced to replace the general term DOSEMETER;<br
    />\r\nb) terms and definitions taken exclusively from IEC TR 60788:2004 and which
    are specifically applicable in this document have been moved to 201.3;<br />\r\nc)
    the collateral standards IEC 60601-1-11:2015, IEC 60601-1-11:2015/AMD1:2020, IEC
    60601-1-12:2014 and IEC 60601-1-12:2014/AMD1:2020 are applicable if MANUFACTURER
    so declares;<br />\r\nd) the subclause 201.11.101 “Protection against excessive
    temperatures of X-ray tube assemblies” has been removed from this document as
    its requirements are sufficiently and clearly covered by IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC
    60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 and IEC 60601-2-28:2017;<br
    />\r\ne) to adopt changes which are introduced with respect to indicator lights
    in 7.8.1 of the IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 clarification of requirements is provided
    to avoid conflicts with requirements of indicator lights stipulated for X-RAY
    EQUIPMENT;<br />\r\nf) explanation of the term ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE is provided
    in Annex AA to emphasize the performance of the clinical function under NORMAL
    and SINGLE FAULT CONDITIONS. CONDITIONS."
