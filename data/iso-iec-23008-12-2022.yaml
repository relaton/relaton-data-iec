    <p>This document specifies the Image File Format, an interoperable storage format for a single image, a collection of images, and sequences of images.</p>
    <p>The format defined in this document is built on tools defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 and enables the interchange, editing, and display of images, as well as the carriage of metadata associated with those images. The Image File Format defines structures used to contain metadata, how to link that metadata to the images, and defines how metadata of certain forms is carried.</p>
    <p>This document also specifies brands for the storage of images and image sequences conforming to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC), Advanced Video Coding (AVC), JPEG, Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and Essential Video Coding (EVC).</p>
    <p>NOTE      The storage of HEVC, AVC, VVC and EVC video sequences is out of scope and is provided in ISO/IEC 14496‑15.</p>
