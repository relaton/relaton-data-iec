  content: "IEC 62148-6:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62148-6:2020
    covers the physical interface specification of optical transceivers for asynchronous
    transfer mode-passive optical network (ATM-PON) systems recommended by the International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU) as ITU Recommendation G.983.1. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003, and constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- inconsistency of types in Clause 4
    has been resolved;<br />\r\n- part and titles list in the Foreword has been deleted;<br
    />\r\n- references have been updated."
