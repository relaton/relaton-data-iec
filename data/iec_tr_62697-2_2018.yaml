abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62697-2:2018(E) specifies a test method for the quantitative determination
    of total corrosive sulfur (TCS) in unused and used insulating liquids and solid
    matrices through the conversion of corrosive sulfur species to metal (copper,
    silver etc.) sulfides. The sulfides formed are quantitatively converted to sulfates;
    sulfates are determined through turbidity measurement or with ion chromatography.<br
    />\r\nThe method is applicable with the following matrices:<br />\r\na) Unused
    and used insulating liquids, for example mineral insulating oils and natural esters,
    which allow the determination of corrosive sulfur compounds over concentrations
    ranging between 2,5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 80 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> TCS.<br />\r\nb)
    Solid matrices that come in contact with the insulating liquid, for example insulating
    papers in electrical equipment. The quantification limits for these matrices depend
    on the amount of matrix used during the determination. The method can be used
    for the quantitative or semi-quantitative determination of copper sulfide on paper
    after the test according to IEC 62535. The method can provide unambiguous quantitative
    assessment of copper sulfide present on paper rather than qualitative results
    obtained with the SEM-EDX examination stipulated in case of doubts in the interpretation
    of results obtained from the inspection of paper according to IEC 62535:2008,
    6.3.<br />\r\nc) Paper and other solid insulating material/s obtained from failed
    transformers, reactors and other electrical equipment to assist in failure diagnostics.<br
    />\r\nd) Metal deactivator or passivators additives present in insulating liquids
    (qualitative assessment).<br />\r\nHowever, the method is not applicable for assessing
    corrosion phenomena for example the dissolution of copper in insulating liquids
    and deposition on solid matrices, which do not lead to sulfide formation."
