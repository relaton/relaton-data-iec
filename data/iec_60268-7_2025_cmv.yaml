abstract:
- content: "IEC 60268-7:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60268-7:2025 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60268-7:2010+AMD1:2020
    CSV edition 3.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 100 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60268-7:2025 is applicable to headphones, earphones,
    headsets and earsets, intended to be used on, or in, the human ear. It also applies
    to equipment, such as pre-amplifiers, passive networks and power supplies which
    form an integral part of the headphone system.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    deal with:<br />\r\n- safety, for which reference is made to IEC 62368-1 or another
    appropriate standard;<br />\r\n- the characteristics of microphones of headsets,
    for which reference is made to IEC 60268â€‘4;<br />\r\n- earphones and other devices
    for hearing aids, for which reference is made to IEC 60118-0;<br />\r\n- headphones
    for audiometry;<br />\r\n- headphones and other devices which form part of an
    active ear-defender system, although some of the provisions of this document can
    be applicable;<br />\r\n- active noise cancelation characteristics as covered
    by IEC 60268-24.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the characteristics which are
    included by the manufacturer in specifications, and relevant methods of measurement.
    It includes a classification of the different types of earphones, mainly characterized
    by the way in which the transducer is coupled acoustically to the ear, and a classification
    code which can also be used for marking. Rated conditions and characteristics
    in this document provided by the manufacturer are not generally intended for external
    verification. Measurement methods for rated characteristics are informative and
    are provided for the benefit of manufacturers for the purpose of test repeatability
    and data comparison. All other specifications and tests are provided for testing
    by the manufacturer and for external testing and verification. This fourth edition
    cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2010, and Amendment 1 of 2020.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- consolidated with IEC 60268-7:2010/AMD1:2020;<br />\r\n- clause/subclause/annex
    reconstruction and renumbering;<br />\r\n- addition of effective frequency range
    of the free-field / diffuse-field compensated frequency response;<br />\r\n- update
    of measurement methods of modulation distortion and difference-frequency distortion;<br
    />\r\n- addition of details of two-tone distortion measurements, see Annex I;<br
    />\r\n- addition of details of left-right tracking response for stereo headphones,
    see Annex J."
