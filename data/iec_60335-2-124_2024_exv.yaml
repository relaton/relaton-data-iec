    of dry ice blasting machines intended for commercial indoor or outdoor use for
    the hand-guided cleaning, decoating and stripping of surfaces. The blasting machines
    are either equipped with containers for storage of dry ice or produce dry ice
    internally. These machines are not equipped with a traction drive.<br />\r\nThe
    following power systems are covered:<br />\r\n- mains powered motors up to a rated
    voltage of 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances,<br
    />\r\n- battery-operated machines.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br
    />\r\n- dry ice blasting machines with integrated generation of compressed air;<br
    />\r\n- dry ice blasting machines using other transport gases besides compressed
    air or nitrogen;<br />\r\n- dry ice blasting machines with nozzles being controlled
    by robotic arms;<br />\r\n- spray extraction machines for commercial use (IEC
    60335-2-68);<br />\r\n- high pressure cleaners (IEC 60335-2-79);<br />\r\n- sand
    blasting equipment (abrasive blasting);<br />\r\n- hand-held and transportable
    motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745 series, IEC 61029 series, IEC 62841 series);<br
    />\r\n- machines designed for use in corrosive or explosive environments (dust,
