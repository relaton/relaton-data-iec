    for broadcast and communications technologies (BCT) cabling in accordance with
    ISO/IEC 11801-4 for use in cabled television distribution networks operating at
    temperature between −40 °C and +70 °C and in the frequency range from 5 MHz to
    6 000 MHz.This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2011. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- extension of frequency range up to
    6 GHz,<br />\r\n- revised sheath marking and labelling,<br />\r\n- a table with
