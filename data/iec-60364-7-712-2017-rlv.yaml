  content: "IEC 60364-7-712:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60364-7-712:2017
    applies to the electrical installation of PV systems intended to supply all or
    part of an installation. The equipment of a PV installation, like any other item
    of equipment, is dealt with only so far as its selection and application in the
    installation is concerned. This new edition includes significant revisions and
    extensions, taking into account experience gained in the construction and operation
    of PV installations, and developments made in technology, since the first edition
    of this standard was published."
