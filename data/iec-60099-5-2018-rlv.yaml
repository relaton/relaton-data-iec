  content: "IEC 60099-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60099-5:2018
    provides information, guidance, and recommendations for the selection and application
    of surge arresters to be used in three-phase systems with nominal voltages above
    1 kV. It applies to gapless metal-oxide surge arresters as defined in IEC 60099-4,
    to surge arresters containing both series and parallel gapped structure – rated
    52 kV and less as defined in IEC 60099-6 and metal-oxide surge arresters with
    external series gap for overhead transmission and distribution lines (EGLA) as
    defined in IEC 60099-8. In Annex J, some aspects regarding the old type of SiC
    gapped arresters are discussed. Surge arrester residual voltage is a major parameter
    to which most users have paid a lot of attention to when selecting the type and
    rating. Typical maximum residual voltages are given in Annex F. It is likely,
    however, that for some systems, or in some countries, the requirements on system
    reliability and design are sufficiently uniform, so that the recommendations of
    the present standard may lead to the definition of narrow ranges of arresters.
    The user of surge arresters will, in that case, not be required to apply the whole
    process introduced here to any new installation and the selection of characteristics
    resulting from prior practice may be continued. Annexes H and I present comparisons
    and calculations between old line discharge classification and new charge classification.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2013.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition regarding the
    new surge arrester classification introduced in IEC 60099-4:2014:<br />\r\na)
    Expanded discussion of comparison between the old and new classification and how
    to calculate or estimate the corresponding charge for different stresses.<br />\r\nb)
    New annexes dealing with:<br />\r\n- Comparison between line discharge classes
    and charge classification<br />\r\n- Estimation of arrester cumulative charges
    and energies during line switching<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: selection and
    application of surge arrestors, nominal voltages above 1 kV"
