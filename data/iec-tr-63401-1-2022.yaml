  content: IEC TR 63401-1:2022(E) discusses the challenges of connecting inverter-based
    resources to low short circuit ratio AC networks, key technical issues and emerging
    technologies. There are the steady-state stability issue, transient state stability
    issue, and oscillatory stability issue, which are the most distinct differences
    compared to inverter-based resources or traditional generators, and accordingly
    brings new challenges to operation, control, protection, etc. Therefore, technical
    solutions are needed. The potential solutions will include new technologies, methods
    and practices, in order to provide more flexibility and improve the efficiency
    of power systems. It is expected that this document can also provide guidance
    for further standardization on relevant issues
