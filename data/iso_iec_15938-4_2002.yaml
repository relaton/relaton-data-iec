abstract:
- content: '<p>This International Standard defines a Multimedia Content Description
    Interface, specifying a series of interfaces</p><p>from system to application
    level to allow disparate systems to interchange information about multimedia content.
    It</p><p>describes the architecture for systems, a language for extensions and
    specific applications, description tools in the</p><p>audio and visual domains,
    as well as tools that are not specific to audio-visual domains. As a whole, this</p><p>International
    Standard encompassing all of the aforementioned components is known as "MPEG-7."
    MPEG-7 is</p><p>divided into eight parts (as defined in the Foreword).</p><p>This
    part of the MPEG-7 Standard (Part 4: Audio) specifies description tools that pertain
    to multimedia in the audio</p><p>domain. See below for further details of application.</p><p>This
    part of the MPEG-7 Standard is intended to be implemented in conjunction with
    other parts of the standard. In</p><p>particular, MPEG-7 Part 4: Audio assumes
    knowledge of Part 2: Description Definition Language (DDL) in its</p><p>normative
    syntactic definitions of Descriptors and Description Schemes. This part of the
    standard also has</p><p>dependencies upon clauses in Part 5: Multimedia Description
    Schemes, namely many of the fundamental</p><p>Description Schemes that extend
    the basic type capabilities of the DDL.</p><p>MPEG-7 is an extensible standard.
    The method to extend the standard beyond the Description Schemes provided</p><p>in
    the standard is to define new ones in the DDL, and to make those DSs available
    with the instantiated</p><p>descriptions. Further details are available in Part
    2. To avoid duplicate functionality with other parts of the standard,</p><p>the
    DDL is the only extension facility provided.</p>'
