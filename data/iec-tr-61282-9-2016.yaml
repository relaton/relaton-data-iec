  content: "IEC TR 61282-9:2016(E) which is a Technical Report, describes effects
    and theory of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and provides guidance on PMD
    measurements. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2006. This second edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- much of the theory has been condensed
    - focusing only on content that is needed to explain the test method;<br />\r\n-
    symbols have been removed, but abbreviations are retained;<br />\r\n- the material
    in the Clause 5 has been significantly reduced in an effort to avoid repeating
    what is already in the actual International Standards. Instead, the focus is on
    explaining the International Standards;<br />\r\n- measurement methods that are
    not found in International Standards have been removed;<br />\r\n- there are significant
    corrections to the modulation phase shift method, particularly in regard to the
    Mueller set technique;<br />\r\n- there are significant corrections to the polarization
    phase shift method;<br />\r\n- the proof of the GINTY interferometric method is
    presented. This proof also extends to the Fixed Analyser Cosine transfer technique;<br
    />\r\n- another Fixed Analyser method is suggested. This is based on the proof
    of the GINTY method and is called \"spectral differentiation method\";<br />\r\n-
    Clause 6 has been renamed \"Limitations\" and refocused on the limitations of
    the test methods. This Technical Report is not intended to be an engineering manual;<br
    />\r\n- the annexes have been removed;<br />\r\n- the bibliography has been much
    reduced in size;<br />\r\n- the introduction has been expanded to include some
    information on system impairments. Keywords: polarization mode dispersion (PMD)"
