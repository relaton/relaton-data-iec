  content: "IEC 60730-2-6:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60730-2-6:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60730-1:2022.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60730-2-6:2025 applies to automatic
    electrical pressure sensing controls<br />\r\n• for use in, on, or in association
    with equipment for household appliance and similar use;<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Throughout
    this document, the word \"equipment\" means \"appliance and equipment\" and \"controls\"
    means \"pressure sensing controls\".<br />\r\n• for building automation within
    the scope of ISO 16484 series and IEC 63044 series (HBES/BACS);<br />\r\nEXAMPLE
    1 Independently mounted automatic electrical pressure sensing controls, controls
    in smart grid systems and controls for building automation systems within the
    scope of ISO 16484-2.<br />\r\n• for equipment that is used by the public, such
    as equipment intended to be used in shops, offices, hospitals, farms and commercial
    and industrial applications;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 2 Automatic electrical pressure
    sensing controls for commercial catering, heating and air-conditioning equipment.<br
    />\r\n• that are smart enabled automatic electrical pressure sensing controls;<br
    />\r\nEXAMPLE 3 Smart grid automatic electrical pressure sensing controls, remote
    interfaces/control of energy-consuming equipment including computer or smart phone.<br
    />\r\n• that are AC or DC powered controls with a rated voltage not exceeding
    690 V AC or 600 V DC;<br />\r\n• used in, on, or in association with equipment
    that use electricity, gas, oil, solid fuel, solar thermal energy, etc., or a combination
    thereof;<br />\r\n• utilized as part of a control system or controls which are
    mechanically integral with multifunctional controls having non-electrical outputs;<br
    />\r\n• using NTC or PTC thermistors and to discrete thermistors, requirements
    for which are contained in Annex J;<br />\r\n• that are mechanically or electrically
    operated, responsive to or controlling a pressure or vacuum;<br />\r\n• as well
    as manual controls when such are electrically and/or mechanically integral with
    automatic controls.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Requirements for manually actuated mechanical
    switches not forming part of an automatic control are contained in IEC 61058-1-1.<br
    />\r\nThis document is also applicable to individual pressure sensing controls
    utilized as part of a control system or pressure sensing controls which are mechanically
    integral with multi-functional controls having non-electrical outputs.<br />\r\nThis
    document is also applicable to pressure sensing controls for appliances within
    the scope of IEC 60335-1.<br />\r\nThis document applies to<br />\r\n- the inherent
    safety of pressure sensing controls, and<br />\r\n- functional safety of pressure
    sensing controls and safety related systems,<br />\r\n- pressure sensing controls
    where the performance (for example the effect of EMC phenomena) of the product
    can impair the overall safety and performance of the controlled system,<br />\r\n-
    the operating values, operating times, and operating sequences where such are
    associated with equipment safety.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the requirements
    for construction, operation and testing of automatic electrical controls used
    in, on, or in association with an equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not<br
    />\r\n• apply to pressure sensing controls intended exclusively for industrial
    process applications unless explicitly mentioned in the relevant part 2 or the
    equipment standard. However, this document can be applied to evaluate automatic
    electrical controls intended specifically for industrial applications in cases
    where no relevant safety standard exists;<br />\r\n• take into account the response
    value of an automatic action of a pressure sensing control, if such a response
    value is dependent upon the method of mounting the control in the equipment. Where
    a response value is of significant purpose for the protection of the user, or
    surroundings, the value defined in the appropriate equipment standard or as determined
    by the manufacturer will apply;<br />\r\n• address the integrity of the output
    signal to the network devices, such as interoperability with other devices unless
    it has been evaluated as part of the control system.<br />\r\nThis document contains
    requirements for electrical features of pressure sensing controls and requirements
    for mechanical features that affect their intended operation.<br />\r\nNOTE Subclause
    20.101, as it pertains to gas and/or oil controls, is under consideration pending
    review or revision of ISO 22967, ISO 22968 and ISO 23550, if applicable.<br />\r\nIn
    general, these pressure sensing controls are integrated or incorporated with the
    equipment or are intended to be integrated in, or on the equipment. This document
    also covers these controls when they are independently mounted. In-line cord controls
    are not covered by this document.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2015 and its Amendment 1:2019. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\nAdoption of IEC
    60730-1:2022 with all of its significant changes to IEC 60730-1:2013, IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD
    1:2015 and IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD2:2020."
