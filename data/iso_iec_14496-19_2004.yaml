abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14496-19:2004 specifies the transmission of synthesized texture
    data as part of the MPEG-4 encoded audio-visual presentation. More specifically,
    it defines:The data structures of synthesized texture;The animation methods of
    synthesized textures; andThe coded representation of synthesized texture data
    streams.Synthesized texture streams are used for creation of very low bit rate
    synthetic video clips. Synthesized texture clips are built using key frame based
    animations of skeletons that affect photorealistic textures whose color information
    is modeled by equations.
