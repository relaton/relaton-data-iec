abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 specifies the form and establishes the interpretation
    of programs expressed in the base Fortran language. Its purpose is to promote
    portability, reliability, maintainability, and efficient execution of Fortran
    programs for use on a variety of computing systems.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 1539-1:2010
    specifies<br /><br />\r\nthe forms that a program written in the Fortran language
    may take,<br />\r\nthe rules for interpreting the meaning of a program and its
    data,<br />\r\nthe form of the input data to be processed by such a program, and<br
    />\r\nthe form of the output data resulting from the use of such a program.<br
    /><br /><br />\r\nExcept where stated otherwise, requirements and prohibitions
    specified by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 apply to programs rather than processors."
