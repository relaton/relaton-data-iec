- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-65:2023 EXV and IEC 60355-2-65:2023 CMV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-65:2023 deals with the safety of electric air-cleaning
    appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more
    than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including
    direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless can be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- air-cleaning appliances where harmful radiation
    is intentionally emitted from the appliance;<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- air-cleaning systems incorporated
    in the building structure;<br />\r\n- appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601
    series).<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) deletion or conversion to normative text for some notes (Clause 1, 11.8,
    16.101);<br />\r\nc) addition of temperature rise limits for accessible surface
    (Clause 11);<br />\r\nd) introduction of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br
    />\r\ne) modification of definition of air-cleaning appliance to include self-contained
    appliance having treatment system other than filter (3.5.101);<br />\r\nf) addition
    of symbol IEC 60417-6040 for UV radiation air-cleaning appliances in place of
    the substance of the marking (7.1, 7.6, 7.12);<br />\r\ng) clarifications on remote
    operation for air cleaning appliances (22.40, 22.49,22.51);<br />\r\nh) removal
    of requirements for UV-C resistant materials and UV exposure that are now covered
    by Part 1 (22.106, 23.101, 32.102, Annex AA).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
