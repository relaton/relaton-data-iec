abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15054:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the additional network feature Call Interception (ANF-CINT) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>ANF-CINT is an additional
    network feature which enables calls that cannot be completed due to certain conditions
    to be redirected to a predetermined intercepted-to user.</p><p>The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC
    15054:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    15053.</p><p>The signalling protocol for ANF-CINT operates on top of the signalling
    protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572,
    and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary
    services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15054:2003 also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between ANF-CINT and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>NOTE Additional
    interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference
    point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15054:2003
    is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
