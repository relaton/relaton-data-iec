abstract:
- content: 'IEC/TR 62627-06:2014 which is a technical report, describes the results
    of mechanical design proving tests for a high density systems application, carried
    out using the nutation test according to IEC 61300-2-35, performed on reinforced
    fibre cable terminated with optical connectors. A tensile load is suggested for
    the design proving requirements to be used to ensure that connectors meet the
    mechanical design requirements of connectors for specific application. Key words:
    mechanical design proving tests for a high density systems application, nutation
    test, IEC 61300-2-35, reinforced fibre cable terminated with optical connectors'
