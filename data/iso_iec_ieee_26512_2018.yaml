abstract:
- content: '<p>This document supports the interest of system users in having consistent,
    complete, accurate, and usable information. It addresses both available approaches
    to standardization: a) process standards, which specify the way that information
    products are to be acquired and supplied; and b) information product standards,
    which specify the characteristics and functional requirements of the information.</p><p>As
    defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, the acquisition and
    supply activities make up the agreement processes of the software or system life
    cycle. Acquisition and supply of information for users and related services are
    specializations of those processes. Such services can be acquired and supplied
    for any part of the information management process, such as the following:</p><p>-
    information management;</p><p>- information design and development;</p><p>- information
    editing and review coordination;</p><p>- information testing, particularly usability
    testing;</p><p>- information production and packaging;</p><p>- information distribution
    and delivery;</p><p>- advice on the selection and implementation of information
    development tools and supporting systems; and</p><p>- information development
    process improvement.</p><p>This document provides an overview of the information
    management processes that are relevant to the acquisition and supply of information
    for users. It applies the Agreement processes (acquisition and supply) to information
    for users, and addresses the preparation of requirements for this information.
    These requirements are central to the information for users specification and
    statement of work discussed in this document. This document also addresses requirements
    for primary document outputs of the acquisition and supply process: the request
    for proposal and the proposal for documentation products and services.</p><p>This
    document is intended for use in acquiring or supplying any type of information
    for users and is independent of information development or management tools or
    methodologies.</p><p>This document might be helpful for acquiring and supplying
    the following types of information, although it does not cover all aspects of
    them:</p><p>- multimedia systems using animation, video, and sound;</p><p>- computer-based
    training (CBT) packages and specialized course materials intended primarily for
    use in formal training programs;</p><p>- maintenance documentation describing
    the internal operation of systems software;</p><p>- collaboratively generated,
    often known as "wiki", documentation, which will usually need to be curated periodically;
    and</p><p>- information for users incorporated into the user interface.</p><p>This
    document is applicable to acquirers and suppliers of information for users, including
    a variety of specialists:</p><p>- analysts (e.g., business analysts, human factors
    engineers) who identify the tasks that the intended users will perform with the
    system;</p><p>- managers of the software or system development process or the
    information management process;</p><p>- managers of the acquisition process, and
    those who authorize and approve acquisitions; and</p><p>- managers and authors
    involved in proposal preparation.</p><p>It can also be consulted by those with
    other roles and interests in the information development process:</p><p>- information
    designers and architects who plan the structure, format, and content requirements
    of information products;</p><p>- experienced authors and editors who develop the
    written content for information for users;</p><p>- graphic designers with expertise
    in electronic media;</p><p>- user interface designers and ergonomics experts working
    together to design the presentation of the information on the screen;</p><p>-
    usability testers, information development reviewers, technical contacts;</p><p>-
    developers of tools for creating on-screen information for users.</p>'
