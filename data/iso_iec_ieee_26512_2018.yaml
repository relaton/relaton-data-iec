abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 26512:2018 This document supports the interest of system
    users in having consistent, complete, accurate, and usable information. It addresses
    both available approaches to standardization: a) process standards, which specify
    the way that information products are to be acquired and supplied; and b) information
    product standards, which specify the characteristics and functional requirements
    of the information.<br />\r\nAs defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2015, the acquisition and supply activities make up the agreement processes
    of the software or system life cycle. Acquisition and supply of information for
    users and related services are specializations of those processes. Such services
    can be acquired and supplied for any part of the information management process,
    such as the following:<br />\r\n- information management;<br />\r\n- information
    design and development;<br />\r\n- information editing and review coordination;<br
    />\r\n- information testing, particularly usability testing;<br />\r\n- information
    production and packaging;<br />\r\n- information distribution and delivery;<br
    />\r\n- advice on the selection and implementation of information development
    tools and supporting systems; and<br />\r\n- information development process improvement.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides an overview of the information management processes
    that are relevant to the acquisition and supply of information for users. It applies
    the Agreement processes (acquisition and supply) to information for users, and
    addresses the preparation of requirements for this information. These requirements
    are central to the information for users specification and statement of work discussed
    in this document. This document also addresses requirements for primary document
    outputs of the acquisition and supply process: the request for proposal and the
    proposal for documentation products and services.<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    for use in acquiring or supplying any type of information for users and is independent
    of information development or management tools or methodologies.<br />\r\nThis
    document might be helpful for acquiring and supplying the following types of information,
    although it does not cover all aspects of them:<br />\r\n- multimedia systems
    using animation, video, and sound;<br />\r\n- computer-based training (CBT) packages
    and specialized course materials intended primarily for use in formal training
    programs;<br />\r\n- maintenance documentation describing the internal operation
    of systems software;<br />\r\n- collaboratively generated, often known as \"wiki\",
    documentation, which will usually need to be curated periodically; and<br />\r\n-
    information for users incorporated into the user interface.<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to acquirers and suppliers of information for users, including a
    variety of specialists:<br />\r\n- analysts (e.g., business analysts, human factors
    engineers) who identify the tasks that the intended users will perform with the
    system;<br />\r\n- managers of the software or system development process or the
    information management process;<br />\r\n- managers of the acquisition process,
    and those who authorize and approve acquisitions; and<br />\r\n- managers and
    authors involved in proposal preparation.<br />\r\nIt can also be consulted by
    those with other roles and interests in the information development process:<br
    />\r\n- information designers and architects who plan the structure, format, and
    content requirements of information products;<br />\r\n- experienced authors and
    editors who develop the written content for information for users;<br />\r\n-
    graphic designers with expertise in electronic media;<br />\r\n- user interface
    designers and ergonomics experts working together to design the presentation of
    the information on the screen;<br />\r\n- usability testers, information development
    reviewers, technical contacts;<br />\r\n- developers of tools for creating on-screen
    information for users."
