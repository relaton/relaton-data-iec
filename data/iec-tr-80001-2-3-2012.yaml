  content: IEC/TR 80001-2-3:2012(E), which is a technical report, supports the Healthcare
    Delivery Organizations (HDO) in the risk management of medical IT-networks that
    incorporate one or more wireless links. The report, as part of IEC 80001, considers
    the use of wirelessly networked medical devices on a medical IT-network and offers
    practical techniques to address the unique risk management requirements of operating
    wirelessly enabled medical devices in a safe, secure and effective manner. The
    targeted audience for this technical report is the HDO IT department, biomedical
    and clinical engineering departments, risk managers, and the people responsible
    for design and operation of the wireless IT network.
