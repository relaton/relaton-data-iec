  content: "IEC 60721-3-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60721-3-1:2018
    classifies the groups of environmental parameters and their severities to which
    products together with their packaging, if any, are subjected when stored. The
    environmental conditions specified in this document are limited to those which
    can directly affect the products or their ultimate performance. Only environmental
    conditions as such are considered. No special description of the effects of these
    conditions on the products is given. Environmental conditions directly related
    to fire or explosions are not included. Conditions of stationary use, portable
    and non-stationary use, use in vehicles and ships, and conditions of transportation
    are given in other subparts of the IEC 60721-3 series. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition, published in 1997, and constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. Clause 3: reworded and simplified.<br
    />\r\nb. Clause 4: reworded and simplified.<br />\r\nc. Clause 5: Annex C has
    been incorporated in Clause 5.<br />\r\nd. 5.2: all existing climate classes have
    been replaced by completely new classes. The new classes are divided into 3 groups.
    The reason for the new classes is the latest revision of IEC 60721-2-1 which incorporated
    new climate types.<br />\r\ne. 5.3: new classes for solar radiation and snow load.<br
    />\r\nf. 5.6: all existing classes for mechanically active substances have been
    replaced by completely new classes.<br />\r\ng. 5.7: all existing classes for
    mechanical conditions have been replaced by completely new classes.<br />\r\nh.
    Table 1: new climatic classes with new severities.<br />\r\ni. Table 2: new classes
    for solar radiation and snow load.<br />\r\nj. Table 5 new mechanically active
    substances classes.<br />\r\nk. Table 6: new mechanical conditions classes.<br
    />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2024-10) has been included in this copy."
