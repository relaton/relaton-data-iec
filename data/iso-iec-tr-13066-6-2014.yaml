    <p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-6:2014 provides an overview to the structure and terminology of the Java accessibility application programming interface (API) It will provide:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>A description of the overall architecture and terminology of the API;</li>
    <li>Further introductory explanations regarding the content and use of the API beyond those found in Annex A of ISO/IEC 13066-1;</li>
    <li>An overview of the main properties, including of:

    <li>a discussion of design considerations for the API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility guidance related to using the API);</li>
    <li>information on extending the API (and where this is appropriate);</li>
    <li>an introduction to the programming interface of the API (including pointers to external sources of information);</li>
    <li>an introduction to the Java Access Bridge for Windows and the Java Access Bridge for GNOME.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>It will provide this information as an introduction to the Java API to assist:</p>
    <ul>
