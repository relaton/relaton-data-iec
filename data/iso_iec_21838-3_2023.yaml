abstract:
- content: "This document describes descriptive ontology for finguistic and cognitive
    engineering (DOLCE) as an ontology that is conformant to the requirements specified
    for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838-1.<br />\r\nThis document describes
    DOLCE as a resource designed to support ontology design, ontology integration,
    and semantic integration of heterogeneous information systems.<br />\r\nThe following
    are within the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- definitions of classes and relations
    in the signature of DOLCE;<br />\r\n- axiomatizations of DOLCE in OWL 2 and CL;<br
    />\r\n- documentation of the conformity of DOLCE to the requirements specified
    for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838-1;<br />\r\n- documentation of the methodology
    for specifying domain ontologies that conform to DOLCE.<br />\r\nThe following
    are outside the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- specification of ontology languages,
    including the languages RDF, OWL, and CL standardly used in ontology development;<br
    />\r\n- specification of methods for reasoning with ontologies;<br />\r\n- specification
    of translators between the notations of ontologies developed in different ontology
    languages."
