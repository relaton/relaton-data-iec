abstract:
- content: "This document:<br />\r\n- provides method(s) for identifying, in Open-edi
    modelling technologies and development of scenarios, the additional requirements
    in business operational view (BOV) specifications for identifying the additional
    external constraints to be applied to recorded information in business transactions
    relating to personal information of an individual, as required by legal and regulatory
    requirements of applicable jurisdictional domains;<br />\r\n- integrates existing
    normative elements in support of privacy and data protection requirements as are
    already identified in ISO/IEC 14662 and ISO/IEC 15944-1, ISO/IEC 15944-2, ISO/IEC
    15944-4, ISO/IEC 15944-5, ISO/IEC 15944-8, ISO/IEC 15944-9, and ISO/IEC 15944-10;<br
    />\r\n- provides overarching, operational?best practice' statements for associated
    (and not necessarily automated) processes, procedures, practices and governance
    requirements that act in support of implementing and enforcing technical mechanisms
    which support the privacy/data protection requirements necessary for implementation
    in Open-edi transaction environments;<br />\r\n- focuses on the life cycle management
    of personal information i.e., the contents of SPIs (and their SRIs) related to
    the business transaction interchanged via EDI as information bundles and their
    associated semantic components among the parties to a business transaction.<br
    />\r\nNOTE Privacy protection requirements (PPR) on information life cycle management
    (ILCM) and EDI of personal information as stated in this document serve as a minimum
    set of ILCM policy and operational requirements for all recorded information pertaining
    to a business transaction in particular, as well as ILCM implementation in any
    organization in general.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify the technical
    mechanisms, i.e., functional support services (FSV) which are required to support
    BOV-identified requirements. Detailed exclusions to the scope of this document
    are provided in Annex H."
