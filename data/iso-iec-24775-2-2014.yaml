  content: "ISO/IEC 24775-2:2014(E) defines the core architecture and protocols in
    SMI-S. The components of SMI-S architecture include:<br />\r\n- Transport - communicating
    management information between constituents of the management system;<br />\r\n-
    Health and fault management - detecting failures through monitoring the state
    of storage components;<br />\r\n- General information about the object model;<br
    />\r\n- Names - how SMI-S uses names to allow applications to correlate across
    SMI-S and to other standards;<br />\r\n- Standard messages - how exceptions are
    presented to client applications;<br />\r\n- Service discovery - techniques clients
    use to discover SMI-S services;<br />\r\n- Installation and upgrade - recommendations
    for implementations;<br />\r\n- Compliance - requirement for compliance to the
    standard. This International Standard, together with ISO/IEC 24775-1 and ISO/IEC
    24775-2 to ISO/IEC 24775-8, replaces ISO/IEC 24775, second edition, published
    in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    reorganization into eight parts;<br />\r\n- maturity identification using stages;<br
    />\r\n- and new profiles."
