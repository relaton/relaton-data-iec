abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63383:2022 deals with cybersecurity related to measuring devices
    (PMD according to IEC 61557-12 and PQI according to IEC 62586-1) and devices for
    data collection (devices according to IEC 62974-1) that are intended to be installed
    in restricted access areas.<br />\r\nThis document deals with cybersecurity aspects
    (e.g. device hardening or device resilience) of device(s) used for power metering
    and monitoring, power quality monitoring, data collection and analysis, but does
    not cover requirements for organisational cybersecurity (e.g. end-user security
    policy).<br />\r\nThis document is a first attempt to develop awareness by manufacturers
    and other relevant stakeholders about cybersecurity aspects and provide basic
    guidance for achieving the appropriate security mitigation against vulnerabilities
    to security threats:<br />\r\n– in coherence with device/system approaches described
    in relevant standards such as IEC 62443 (all parts) and ISO/IEC 27001,<br />\r\n–
    based on generic system use-cases.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover billing
    meters covered by the IEC 62053-2x set of standards."
