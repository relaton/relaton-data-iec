abstract:
- content: This technical report explores the similarities and differences between
    home and building control systems in an environment where both home and building
    control interact, namely, a mixed-use residential&#x2F;commercial building. A
    logical model for linking building and home control systems is specified. Models
    showing the organization of application domains, such as energy management and
    lighting, are included. The option of managing an application domain with a single
    application controller versus a Fully Distributed System is considered. Methods
    for overall building management are presented.
