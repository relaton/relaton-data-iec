abstract:
- content: IEC 61691-1-1:2011(E) Revises and enhances the VHDL language reference
    manual (LRM) by including a standard C language interface specification. The VHDL
    language was defined for use in the design and documentation of electronics systems.
    It is revised to incorporate capabilities that improve the language's usefulness
    for its intended purpose as well as extend it to address design verification methodologies
    that have developed in industry. These new design and verification capabilities
    are required to ensure VHDL remains relevant and valuable for use in electronic
    systems design and verification. Incorporation of previously separate, but related
    standards, simplifies the maintenance of the specifications. This publication
    has the status of a double logo IEEE/IEC standard.
