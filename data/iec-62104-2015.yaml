  script: Latn
  content: IEC 62104:2015(E) describes the digital audio broadcasting (DAB) receiver
    characteristics for consumer equipment intended for terrestrial and cable reception
    operating in VHF band III. Dedicated receivers for specific applications are not
    within the scope of this standard. This standard describes the characteristics
    for different classes and categories of DAB receivers such as standard and multimedia
    receivers and domestic, automotive and adapter receivers. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are
    as follows. The document has been updated in line with the development of the
    DAB system, and in particular the introduction of DAB audio services (see ETSI
    TS 102 563). Requirements for displays, text and data applications have been introduced
    to reflect market trends. Additional test methods have been introduced to allow
    R.F. measurements to be made on receivers with integrated antennas and/or no external
    BER indicators by using an acoustic impairment method. Clause 6 has been updated
    to reflect the development of the market and to provide better guidance for the
    implementation of optional features.
