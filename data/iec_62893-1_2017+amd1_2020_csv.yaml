abstract:
- content: "IEC 62893-1:2017+A1:2020 specifies construction, dimensions and test requirements
    for cables with extruded insulation and sheath having a voltage rating of up to
    and including 0,6/1 kV AC or up to and including 1 500 V DC for flexible applications
    under harsh conditions for the power supply between the electricity supply point
    of the charging station and the electric vehicle (EV). The EV charging cable is
    intended to supply power and, if needed, communication (for details see the IEC
    62196 series and IEC 61851-1) to an EV or plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV). The charging
    cables are applicable for charging modes 1 to 4 of IEC 61851-1. Ordinary duty
    cables with rated voltage 300/500 V are only permitted for charging mode 1 of
    IEC 61851-1. Maximum conductor temperature for the cables in this part of IEC
    62893 is 90 ºC. The particular types of cables are specified in IEC 62893-3 (modes
    1 to 3 for AC charging) and in the future IEC 62893-4 (mode 4 for DC charging).
    These parts are collectively referred to hereafter as “the particular specifications”.<br
    />\r\nThe test methods specified are given in IEC 62893-2, IEC 60245-2, IEC 60332-1-2,
    IEC 62821-1:2015, Annex B, and in the relevant parts of IEC 60811, as listed in
    the normative references.<strong>This consolidated version consists of the first
    edition (2017) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.</strong>"
