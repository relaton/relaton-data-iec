abstract:
- content: "IEC 62715-5-3:2017(E) provides the framework and procedures for performing
    the visual assessment of flexible display devices.<br />\r\nVisual assessment
    stipulated in this document is applicable to flexible display modules in the following
    states:<br />\r\n- initial states and ageing states under standard ambient conditions,<br
    />\r\n- mechanically or environmentally stressed conditions,<br />\r\n- states
    after mechanical endurance test(s), after environmental endurance test(s) and
    after a combination of mechanical and environmental endurance tests.<br />\r\nVisual
    assessment is performed by comparing a test sample to a limit sample or to a set
    of grade samples. This document provides the framework and procedures for visual
    assessments that use a limit sample or a set of grade samples. This document describes
    the framework and procedure that are followed while preparing limit samples and
    a set of grade samples. This document also describes visual assessment when limit
    samples and grade samples are not available for the same type of defect.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides sets of test patterns that can be used in visual assessments."
