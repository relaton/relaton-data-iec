  content: IEC/PAS 61169-40:2008(E) is a sectional specification providing information
    and rules for preparation of detail specification of 2.4 series R.F connectors
    together with the pro-forma blank detail specification. The 2.4 series connectors
    with characteristic impedance 50 &Omega; are used for millimeter wave applications,
    connecting with RF cables or microstrips. The operating frequency limit is up
    to 50 GHz. It also prescribes mating face dimensions for high performance connectors
    grade 1, dimensional detail of standard test connectors grade o, gauging information
    and tests selected from QC 22000 (IEC 61169-1) applicable to all detail specifications
    relating to 2.4 series RF connectors.
