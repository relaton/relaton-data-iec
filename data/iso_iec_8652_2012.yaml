abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 8652:2012 specifies the form and meaning of programs written
    in the programming language Ada. Its purpose is to promote the portability of
    Ada programs to a variety of computing systems.</p><p>This third edition of ISO/IEC
    8652 focuses on improvements in those user domains where safety and criticality
    are prime concerns. It enhances the functionality of containers, improves the
    ability to write and enforce contracts for Ada entities (for instance, via preconditions),
    and adds to the capabilities of Ada to perform on multicore and multithreaded
    architectures.</p><p>Ada is designed to support the construction of long‐lived,
    highly reliable software systems. The language includes facilities to define packages
    of related types, objects, and operations. The packages may be parameterized and
    the types may be extended to support the construction of libraries of reusable,
    adaptable software components. The operations may be implemented as subprograms
    using conventional sequential control structures, or as entries that include synchronization
    of concurrent threads of control as part of their invocation. Ada supports object‐oriented
    programming by providing classes and interfaces, inheritance, polymorphism of
    variables and methods, and generic units. The language treats modularity in the
    physical sense as well, with a facility to support separate compilation.</p><p>The
    language provides rich support for real‐time, concurrent programming, and includes
    facilities for multicore and multiprocessor programming. Errors can be signaled
    as exceptions and handled explicitly. The language also covers systems programming;
    this requires precise control over the representation of data and access to system‐dependent
    properties. Finally, a predefined environment of standard packages is provided,
    including facilities for, among others, input‐output, string manipulation, numeric
    elementary functions, random number generation, and definition and use of containers.</p><p>Foremost
    in the design of Ada is the intent to increase the reliability of programs by
    compiletime checking and rejection of unsafe programs.</p>"
