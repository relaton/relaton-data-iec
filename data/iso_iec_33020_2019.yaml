abstract:
- content: "This document defines a process measurement framework that supports the
    assessment of process capability, in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC
    33003. The process measurement framework provides a schema that can be used to
    construct a process assessment model conformant with ISO/IEC 33004 which can be
    used in the performance of assessment of process capability according to the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 33002. In the context of this document and related standards, process
    capability is a process quality characteristic related to the ability of a process
    to consistently meet current or projected business goals.<br />\r\nThe process
    measurement framework defined in this document forms a structure which<br />\r\na)
    facilitates self-assessment,<br />\r\nb) provides a basis for use in process improvement
    and process quality determination,<br />\r\nc) is applicable across all application
    domains and sizes of organization,<br />\r\nd) produces a set of process (capability)
    attribute ratings (process profile), and<br />\r\ne) derives a process capability
    level.<br />\r\nThis document also includes as informative annexes a set of assessment
    indicators of process capability that can be used in the construction of a process
    assessment model using this process measurement framework, and guidance on the
    meaning of the process capability levels and the achievement of the process attributes."
