abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a process measurement framework that supports
    the assessment of process capability, in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC
    33003. The process measurement framework provides a schema that can be used to
    construct a process assessment model conformant with ISO/IEC 33004 which can be
    used in the performance of assessment of process capability according to the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 33002. In the context of this document and related standards, process
    capability is a process quality characteristic related to the ability of a process
    to consistently meet current or projected business goals.</p><p>The process measurement
    framework defined in this document forms a structure which</p><p>a) facilitates
    self-assessment,</p><p>b) provides a basis for use in process improvement and
    process quality determination,</p><p>c) is applicable across all application domains
    and sizes of organization,</p><p>d) produces a set of process (capability) attribute
    ratings (process profile), and</p><p>e) derives a process capability level.</p><p>This
    document also includes as informative annexes a set of assessment indicators of
    process capability that can be used in the construction of a process assessment
    model using this process measurement framework, and guidance on the meaning of
    the process capability levels and the achievement of the process attributes.</p>"
