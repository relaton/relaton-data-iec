abstract:
- content: <p>EPUBÂ® documents, unlike print books or PDF files, are designed to change.
    The content flows, or reflows, to fit</p><p>the screen and to fit the needs of
    the reader. The EPUB 3.0 Specification says that "content presentation should</p><p>adapt
    to the user rather than the user having to adapt to a particular representation
    of content."</p><p>But this principle doesn't work for all types of documents.
    Sometimes content and design are so intertwined</p><p>they cannot be separated.
    Any change in appearance risks changing the meaning, or losing all meaning.<em>Fixedlayout</em></p><p><em>documents</em>give
    content creators greater control over presentation, when a reflowable EPUB is
    not</p><p>suitable for the content.</p><p>This document, EPUB 3 Fixed-Layout Documents,
    defines a set of metadata properties to allow declarative</p><p>expression of
    intended rendering behaviors of fixed-layout documents in the context of EPUB
    3. It also defines</p><p>mechanisms to express the intended rendering dimensions
    of fixed-layout XHTML and SVG [ContentDocs30]</p><p>content, as well as bitmap
    images.</p>
