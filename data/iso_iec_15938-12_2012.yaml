abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15938-12:2012 describes the query format tools which may be
    used independently or in combination with other parts of ISO/IEC 15938. Each query
    format tool is described in two normative sections:</p><p>a) Syntax: Normative
    specification of the query and management format.</p><p>b) Semantic: Normative
    definition of the semantics of all the components of the corresponding query format
    specification.</p><p>In some instances the query format level tool is also described
    using either one or two informative sections:</p><p>a) Examples:Optionally, an
    informative section dealing with examples is appended.</p><p>b) Definitions:Optionally,
    an informative section dealing with definitions is appended.</p><p>The query format
    provides a standardized interface for multimedia content information retrieval
    systems (e.g. MPEG-7 databases) in three aspects which are input query format,
    output query format, and query managements. The input query format specifies the
    interface through which the users can describe their search criteria with a set
    of precise input parameters in addition to a set of preferred output parameters
    to depict the return result sets. The output query format specifies the interface
    format for the result set. The query management provides means for selecting services
    (e.g. MPEG-7 database) or aggregated services (e.g. service provider that administers
    a set of different services) based on service properties (e.g. supported query
    format).</p>"
