  content: IEC TR 62443-2-3:2015(E) describes requirements for asset owners and industrial
    automation and control system (IACS) product suppliers that have established and
    are now maintaining an IACS patch management program. This Technical Report recommends
    a defined format for the distribution of information about security patches from
    asset owners to IACS product suppliers, a definition of some of the activities
    associated with the development of the patch information by IACS product suppliers
    and deployment and installation of the patches by asset owners. The exchange format
    and activities are defined for use in security related patches; however, it may
    also be applicable for non-security related patches or updates.
