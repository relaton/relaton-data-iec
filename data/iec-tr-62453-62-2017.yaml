  content: IEC TR 62453-62:2017(E), which is a Technical Report, explains the guidelines
    and rules for the CLI‑based implementation of a Device Type Manager (DTM) and
    parts of a Frame Application with regard to the user interface and its behaviour.
    These guidelines and rules are part of the FDT specification (IEC TR 62453‑42)
    and are intended to ensure that all users are provided with clear and consistent
    user interface functions and features across DTMs in a system.
