abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14882:2014 specifies requirements for implementations of the
    C<strong>++</strong>programming language. The first such requirement is that they
    implement the language, and so this International Standard also defines C<strong>++</strong>.
    Other requirements and relaxations of the first requirement appear at various
    places within this International Standard.</p><p>C<strong>++</strong>is a general
    purpose programming language based on the C programming language as described
    in ISO/IEC 9899:1999<em>Programming languages? C</em>(hereinafter referred to
    as the<em>C standard</em>). In addition to the facilities provided by C, C<strong>++</strong>provides
    additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, operator overloading,
    function name overloading, references, free store management operators, and additional</p><p>library
    facilities.</p>"
