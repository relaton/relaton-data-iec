abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62869:2013(E) addresses activities and considerations related to
    wireless power transfer for audio, video and multimedia systems and equipment.
    It combines public information, contributions by experts and completed IEC TC
    100 WPT survey responses and reviews global market conditions. The TR describes
    a range of WPT technical approaches with the aid of a system reference model,
    outlines the impacts on WPT of applicable regulation and surveys standards development
    organization (SDO) and private industry consortium-led activities in support of
    WPT technical standards development. The TR concludes with observations and recommendations
    for potential future technical standards development activities that lie within
    scope of IEC TC 100.
