abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language
    (1.3) that enable the specification of Transactional Memory. These extensions
    include new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language and library.</p><p>The
    International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context and specification
    for this Technical Specification. This document is written as a set of changes
    against that specification. Instructions to modify or add paragraphs are written
    as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly to existing text from the
    International Standard use<strong>green</strong> to represent added text and strikethrough
    to represent deleted text.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 is non-normative. Some
    of the functionality described by this Technical Specification may be considered
    for standardization in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part any
    C++ standard. Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never
    be standardized, and other functionality may standardized in a substantially changed
    form.</p><p>The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing
    practice for Transactional Memory. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors
    who wish to provide them</p>"
