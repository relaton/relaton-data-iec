abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language
    (1.3) that enable the specification of Transactional Memory. These extensions
    include new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language and library.<br
    />\r\nThe International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context and
    specification for this Technical Specification. This document is written as a
    set of changes against that specification. Instructions to modify or add paragraphs
    are written as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly to existing
    text from the International Standard use green to represent added text and strikethrough
    to represent deleted text.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 is non-normative. Some
    of the functionality described by this Technical Specification may be considered
    for standardization in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part any
    C++ standard. Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never
    be standardized, and other functionality may standardized in a substantially changed
    form.<br />\r\nThe goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread
    existing practice for Transactional Memory. It gives advice on extensions to those
    vendors who wish to provide them"
