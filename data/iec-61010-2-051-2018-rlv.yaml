  content: "IEC 61010-2-051:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61010-2-051:2018
    is applicable to electrically operated laboratory equipment and its accessories
    for mechanical mixing and stirring, where mechanical energy influences the shape
    or size or homogeneity of materials and their accessories. Such devices can contain
    heating elements. It has the status of a group safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- adaptation of changes introduced by Amendment 1 of IEC 61010-1;<br
    />\r\n- added tolerance for stability of AC voltage test equipment to Clause 6;<br
    />\r\n- added required assessment for equipment intended to be used with flammable,
    hazardous, or toxic fluids to Clause 17.<br />\r\nThis Part 2-051 is intended
    to be used in conjunction with IEC 61010-1. It was established on the basis of
    the third edition (2010) and its Amendment 1 (2016).</p>"
