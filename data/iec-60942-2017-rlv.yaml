  content: "IEC 60942:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60942:2017
    specifies the performance requirements for three classes of sound calibrator:
    class LS (Laboratory Standard), class 1 and class 2. Acceptance limits are smallest
    for class LS and greatest for class 2 instruments. Class LS sound calibrators
    are normally used only in the laboratory; class 1 and class 2 are considered as
    sound calibrators for field use. A class 1 sound calibrator is primarily intended
    for use with a class 1 sound level meter and a class 2 sound calibrator primarily
    with a class 2 sound level meter, as specified in IEC 61672-1. The acceptance
    limits for class LS sound calibrators are based on the use of a laboratory standard
    microphone, as specified in IEC 61094-1, for demonstrations of conformance to
    the requirements of this document. The acceptance limits for class 1 and class
    2 sound calibrators are based on the use of a working standard microphone, as
    specified in IEC 61094-4, for demonstrations of conformance to the requirements
    of this document. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2003, of which it constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) deletion of the class designations, class LS/C, class 1/C and class 2/C;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of two further class designations, class LS/M and class 1/M,
    specifically for pistonphones;<br />\r\nc) addition of an amended criterion for
    assessing conformance to a specification: conformance is now demonstrated when
    (a) measured deviations from design goals do not exceed the applicable acceptance
    limits and (b) the uncertainty of measurement does not exceed the corresponding
    maximum-permitted uncertainty;<br />\r\nd) modification to the short-term level
    fluctuation test of the sound pressure level stability;<br />\r\ne) change to
    some environmental test conditions to avoid icing;<br />\r\nf) addition of an
    alternative test for immunity to radio-frequency fields using transverse electromagnetic
    (TEM) waveguides.</p>"
