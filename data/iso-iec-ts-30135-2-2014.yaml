  content: "<p>This specification, EPUB Publications 3.0, defines publication-level
    semantics and conformance requirements for EPUB® 3, including the format of the
    Package Document and rules for how this document and other Publication Resources
    are associated to create a conforming EPUB Publication.<br />This specification
    is one of a family of related specifications that compose EPUB 3, the third major
    revision of an interchange and delivery format for digital publications based
    on XML and Web Standards. It is meant to be read and understood in concert with
    the other specifications that make up EPUB 3: <br />- The EPUB 3 Overview, which
    provides an informative overview of EPUB and a roadmap to the rest of the EPUB
    3 documents. The Overview should be read first.<br />- EPUB Content Documents
    3.0, which defines profiles of XHTML, SVG and CSS for use in the context of EPUB
    Publications.<br />- EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0, which defines a file
    format and processing model for encapsulating a set of related resources into
    a single-file (ZIP) EPUB Container.<br />- EPUB Media Overlays 3.0, which defines
    a format and a processing model for synchronization of text and audio.<br />This
    specification supersedes Open Package Format 2.0.1. Refer to EPUB3 changes for
    information on differences between this specification and its predecessor.<br
