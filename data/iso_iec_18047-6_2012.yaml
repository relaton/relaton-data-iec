abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18047-6:2012 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (tags and interrogators) for
    item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-6, but does not
    apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The
    test methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions
    which are implemented, are verified. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be
    supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are
    not available in general cases.</p><p>The interrogator and tag conformance parameters
    in ISO/IEC 18047-6:2012 are the following:</p><p>· type-specific conformance parameters
    including nominal values and tolerances;</p><p>· parameters that apply directly
    affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</p><p>The following is not
    included in ISO/IEC 18047-6:2012:</p><p>· parameters that are already included
    in regulatory test requirements.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in
    ISO/IEC 18047-6:2012 are to be applied exclusively to RFID tags and interrogators
    defined in ISO/IEC 18000-6.</p>"
