abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-67:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-67:2021
    deals with the safety of powered floor treatment machines intended for commercial
    indoor or outdoor use for the following applications:<br />\r\n- scrubbing,<br
    />\r\n- wet or dry pick-up,<br />\r\n- polishing and dry buffing,<br />\r\n- application
    of wax, sealing products and powder based detergents,<br />\r\n- shampooing,<br
    />\r\n- stripping, grinding and scarifying<br />\r\nof floors with an artificial
    surface.<br />\r\nThese machines have a cleaning motion which is more lateral
    or periodic than linear.<br />\r\nBy contrast, the cleaning motion of machines
    covered by IEC 60335-2-72 is more linear than lateral or periodic.<br />\r\nThis
    standard applies to machines for commercial use. The following list, although
    not comprehensive, gives an indication of locations that are included in the scope:<br
    />\r\n- public use areas such as hotels, schools, hospitals;<br />\r\n- industrial
    locations, for example factories and manufacturing shops;<br />\r\n- retail outlets,
    for example shops and supermarkets;<br />\r\n- business premises, for example
    offices and banks;<br />\r\n- all uses other than normal housekeeping purposes.<br
    />\r\nThese machines are not equipped with a traction drive.<br />\r\nMachines
    for the same intended function but equipped with a traction drive are covered
    by IEC 60335 2-72.<br />\r\nThe following power systems are covered:<br />\r\n-
    internal combustion engines,<br />\r\n- mains powered motors up to a rated voltage
    of 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances,<br />\r\n-
    battery-operated machines.<br />\r\nBattery-operated machines may be equipped
    with a built-in battery charger.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n-
    vacuum cleaners and water-suction cleaning appliances for household use (IEC 60335
    2 2);<br />\r\n- floor treatment appliances for household use (IEC 60335-2-10);<br
    />\r\n- spray extraction machines for commercial use (IEC 60335-2-68);<br />\r\n-
    wet and dry vacuum cleaners, including power brush, for commercial use (IEC 60335
    2 69);<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-68 and IEC 60335-2-69 cover only machines without
    traction drive.<br />\r\n- floor treatment machines with or without traction drive,
    for commercial use (IEC 60335 2 72);<br />\r\n- hand-held and transportable motor-operated
    electric tools (IEC 60745 series, IEC 61029 series, IEC 62841 series);<br />\r\n-
    machines designed for use in corrosive or explosive environments (dust, vapour
    or gas);<br />\r\n- machines designed for picking up hazardous dusts (as defined
    in IEC 60335-2-69), inflammable substances, or glowing particles;<br />\r\n- machines
    designed for use in vehicles or on board of ships or aircraft.<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2012 and its Amendment
    1: 2016. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- editorial and technical alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of
    that standard."
