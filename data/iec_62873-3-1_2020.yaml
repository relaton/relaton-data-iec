abstract:
- content: "IEC 62873-3-1:2020 applies to devices equipped with screwless-type terminals
    for current not exceeding 40 A, primarily suitable for connecting unprepared copper
    conductors of crossâ€‘section up to 10 mm2. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Modification of scope to cover screwless-type
    terminals up to 40 A;<br />\r\n- Modification of scope to address other devices
    in addition to RCDs;<br />\r\n- Modification of Table 1 to cover rated currents
    up to 40 A;<br />\r\n- Modification of 8.1 so that IEC 62873-3-1 can be referred
    to by other product standards in addition to those for RCDs;<br />\r\n- Modification
    of 9.1 so that IEC 62873-3-1 can be referred to by other product standards in
    addition to those for RCDs."
