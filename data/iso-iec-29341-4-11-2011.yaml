  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-4-11:2011(E) describes the service-type which enables modeling
    of streaming capabilities of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between
    devices. Each device that is able to send or receive a stream according to the
    UPnP AV Architecture will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This
    service provides a mechanism for control points to:<br/>                          \na)
    Perform capability matching between source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,<br/>
    \                                   \nb) Find information about currently ongoing
    transfers in the network,<br/>                                                  \nc)
    Setup and teardown connections between devices (when required by the streaming
    protocol).<br/>                                     \nThis service definition
    is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. This International
    Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-11, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes
    a technical revision."
