    <p>ISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects to enable data interchange between such disks.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies two Types, viz.</p>
    <p>Type R/W provides for data to be written, read and erased many time over the recording surface(s) of the disk.</p>
    <p>Type WO provides for data once written to be read a multiplicity of times. Data shall not be erased nor amended. Multisession (incremental write operations) recording may be performed on type WO disks.</p>
    <p>The disk shall be of the same Type if recorded on both sides, A and B. Each side shall have a nominal capacity of 4,58 Gbytes, irrespective of the Type. The format specifies two sector sizes and allows for emulation of two further sizes. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies</p>
    <ul><li>the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</li><li>the environments in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</li><li>the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems;</li><li>the format of the information on the disk, both embossed and user-written, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correction codes, the modulation methods used;</li><li>the characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;</li><li>the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write data onto the disk;</li><li>the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</li></ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 22092:2002 provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
