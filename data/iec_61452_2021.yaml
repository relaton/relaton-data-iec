abstract:
- content: "IEC 61452:2021 establishes methods for the calibration and use of high
    purity germanium spectrometers for the measurement of photon energies and emission
    rates over the energy range from 45 keV to approximately 3 000 keV and the calculation
    of radionuclide activities from these measurements. Minimum requirements for automated
    peak finding are stated. This document establishes methods for measuring the full-energy
    peak efficiency with calibrated sources.<br />\r\nThe object of this document
    is to provide a basis for the routine calibration and use of germanium (HPGe)
    semiconductor detectors for the measurement of gamma-ray emission rates and thereby
    the activities of the radionuclides in a sample. It is intended for use by persons
    who have an understanding of the principles of HPGe gamma-ray spectrometry and
    are responsible for the development of correct procedures for the calibration
    and use of such detectors. This document is primarily intended for routine analytical
    measurements. Related documents are IEC 60973 and ISO 20042.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1995. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na. title modified;<br />\r\nb. additional information on digital
    electronics;<br />\r\nc. information on Monte Carlo simulations;<br />\r\nd. reference
    to detection limits calculations."
