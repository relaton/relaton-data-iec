abstract:
- content: "IEC 62973-2:2020 applies to NiCd rechargeable batteries for auxiliary
    power supply systems used on railway vehicles. It is an extension of IEC 62973-1:2018
    which specifies common requirements for all battery technologies of other parts
    of IEC 62973. Unless otherwise specified, the requirements of IEC 62973-1:2018
    apply.<br />\r\nBattery systems described in this document are used in conjunction
    with charging systems onboard rolling stock, as described in IEC 62973-1:2018.
    Charging systems (e.g. LVPS, converters, etc.) are excluded from the scope of
    this document.<br />\r\nThis document also specifies the design, operation parameters,
    safety recommendations, routine and type tests, as well as marking and designation.
    This document is used in addition to IEC 60623:2017 or IEC 62259:2003 for NiCd
    Cells."
