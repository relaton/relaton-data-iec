  content: IEC TR 61000-4-40:2020 which is a Technical Report, deals with the assessment
    of electrical power quantities (RMS voltage, RMS current and active power). It
    explains and compares two digital algorithms suitable for power quantity measurements
    in fluctuating or non-periodic loads. The examples are from 50 Hz or 60 Hz power
    systems. This document does not attempt to cover all possible digital implementations
    of the algorithms used for power quantity assessment in fluctuating loads, for
    example in the context of the EMC assessment described in several IEC documents.
    Rather, it compares averaging with one of the filtering algorithms. This document
    aims to highlight some examples of applications that illustrate how the presented
    algorithms work. Further, guidance is given for quantifying the accuracy of each
    approach.
