    IEC/TR 62153-4-1:2010(E) gives a brief introduction to basic concepts and terms trying to reveal the common features of apparently different test methods. It should assist in correct interpretation of test data, and in the better understanding of screening (or shielding) and related specifications and standards. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007. The significant change is a new clause on the background of the shielded screening attenuation test method.
