  content: IEC 62257-9-1:2008(E) applies to a micropower plant which is the electric
    energy generation subsystem associated with a decentralized rural electrification
    system. It provides general requirements for the design, erection and operation
    of micropower plants and general requirements to ensure the safety of persons
    and property. The micropower plants covered by this specification are low-voltage
    a.c., three-phase or single-phase, with rated capacity less than, or equal to,
    100 kVA.
