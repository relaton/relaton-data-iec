- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-108:2024 EXV and IEC 60335-2-108:2024 RLV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-108:2024 deals with the safety of electrolysers that produce
    low viscosity, ionized liquids intended for use as detergent free wash water in
    appliances for household and similar purposes and which conform with the standards
    applicable to such appliances. It applies to electrolysers tested separately,
    under the most severe conditions that can be expected to occur in normal use,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied
    appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that
    can contain electrolysers are:<br />\r\n- dishwashers (IEC 60335-2-5);<br />\r\n-
    washing machines (IEC 60335-2-7);<br />\r\n- appliances producing wash water for
    hygiene purposes.<br />\r\nThis standard does not supersede the requirements of
    standards relevant to the particular appliance in which the electrolyser is used.
    However, if the electrolyser used complies with this standard, the tests for the
    electrolyser specified in the particular appliance standard can be unnecessary
    in the particular appliance or assembly. If the electrolyser control system is
    associated with the particular appliance control system, additional tests can
    be necessary on the final appliance. Guidance for additional requirements to be
    considered for inclusion in the end product standards for appliances that use
    electrolysers is given in informative Annex BB.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to
    the fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on
    board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes
    have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 22.012);<br />\r\nc) application
    of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2, B22.3, B22.4);<br />\r\nd)
    addition of external accessible surface temperatures (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1:2020
    and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest
    edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of
    the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
