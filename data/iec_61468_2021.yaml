abstract:
- content: "IEC 61468:2021 applies to in-core neutron detectors, viz. self-powered
    neutron detectors (SPNDs), which are intended for application in systems important
    for nuclear reactor safety: protection, instrumentation and control. This document
    contains SPND characteristics and test methods. In this document, the main sources
    of errors, and the possibilities for their minimization are also considered. This
    document contains requirements, recommendations and instructions concerning selection
    of SPND type and characteristics for various possible applications.<br />\r\nThis
    document about SPNDs uses the basic requirements of IEC 61513 and IEC 60568 and
    complements them with more specific provisions in compliance with IAEA Safety
    Guides.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published
    in 2000, and its Amendment 1, published in 2003.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. Title modified.<br />\r\nb. Justify the requirements for SPND characteristics
    in terms of influencing factors.<br />\r\nc. Align the terminology with the current
    state of the regulatory framework."
