  content: "IEC 61937-3:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61937-3:2017
    describes the method used to convey non-linear PCM bitstreams encoded according
    to the AC-3 and enhanced AC-3 formats. This third edition of IEC 61937-3 cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) removal of support for
    enhanced AC-3 bitstreams with a sampling frequency of 32 kHz;<br />\r\nb) updates
    to normative and informative references;<br />\r\nc) clarification of pause data-burst
    usage for enhanced AC-3 bitstreams."
