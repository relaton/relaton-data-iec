abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 23004-1:2007 specifies the architecture of the MPEG Multimedia
    Middleware technology. Multimedia Middleware (M3W) allows application software
    to execute multimedia functions with a minimum knowledge of the inner workings
    of the multimedia middleware as well as to support a structured way of updating,
    upgrading and/or extending the multimedia middleware. The architecture consists
    of the following.    M3W API:      multimedia API (specified in detail in ISO/IEC
    23004-2);    interfaces for audio broadcast decoding, processing and rendering;    interfaces
    for video broadcast decoding, processing and rendering;    IPMP interfaces;    governance
    interfaces.      Support API (specified in detail in ISO/IEC 23004-3 to ISO/IEC
    23004-7):      interfaces for instantiation of services (Runtime Environment and
    Service Manager);    interfaces for interaction with remote services (REMI-P and
    REMI-R, REMI stands for Remote Method Invocator);    interfaces for Resource Management;    interfaces
    for Component Download;    interfaces for Fault Management;    interfaces for
    Integrity Management.      Realization technology (specified in detail in ISO/IEC
    23004-3):      Unit of Trading;    Unit of Loading;    Unit of Instantiation;    standard
    interfaces:      navigation between interfaces,    binding,    access to public
    attributes.'
