  content: 'Aims at defining a qualification profile for electronic assembly manufacturers,
    making audits simpler and less frequently required. Less paper work would thus
    be necessary as customers and suppliers work closer to meeting each others'' needs.
    A diskette is also available with the hardcopy of this PAS. Two zipped files are
    available through Webstore : the pdf file of the PAS itself and the contents of
