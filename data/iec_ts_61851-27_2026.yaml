abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61851-27:2026, in combination with IEC 61851-1 or IEC 61851-23,
    gives the requirements for EV supply equipment with automatic docking and undocking
    functions (aEVSE) of a vehicle coupler according to IEC 62196-2, IEC 62196-3 or
    IEC TS 62196-3-1 for power transfer with electrically propelled road vehicles
    according to ISO TS 5474-5.<br />\r\nUse of aEVSE with the megawatt charging system
    is under consideration.<br />\r\nThis document provides requirements for aEVSE
    with a single vehicle connector.<br />\r\nRequirements for aEVSE with more than
    one vehicle connector are under consideration.<br />\r\nThis document only applies
    to aEVSE with automatic couplers of category 1: using vehicle couplers defined
    by IEC 62196-2, IEC 62196-3 or IEC TS 62196-3-1.<br />\r\nThis document only specifies
    automatic conductive energy transfer using a vehicle connector and a vehicle inlet;
    it does not specify automatic conductive power transfer using a plug and a socket-outlet.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to aEVSE with automatic couplers of category
    2: using an electro-mechanical interface defined by EN 50696.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not apply to aEVSE with automatic coupler of category 3 (see IEC TS 61851-26).<br
    />\r\nEMC requirements for EV supply equipment are defined in IEC 61851-21-2.<br
    />\r\nInteroperable communication for docking and undocking between an aEVSE and
    an EV, extending the communication between an EV supply equipment and an EV as
    specified in IEC 61851-1, IEC 61851-23, IEC 61851-24 and the ISO 15118 series,
    is under consideration.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover all safety aspects
    related to maintenance"
