    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-15:2024 deals with the safety of electrical appliances
    for heating liquids for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances. Some appliances in this standard are used for heating food.<br />\r\nExamples
    of appliances that are within the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n– coffee-makers;<br
    />\r\n– cooking pans;<br />\r\n– egg boilers;<br />\r\n– feeding-bottle heaters;<br
    />\r\n– kettles and other appliances for boiling water, having a rated capacity
    not exceeding 10 l;<br />\r\n– milk heaters;<br />\r\n– pressure cookers having
    a rated cooking pressure not exceeding 140 kPa and a rated capacity not exceeding
    10 l;<br />\r\n– rice cookers;<br />\r\n– slow cookers;<br />\r\n– steam cookers;<br
    />\r\n– soy milk makers;<br />\r\n– tea maker;<br />\r\n– wash boilers;<br />\r\n–
    yoghurt makers.<br />\r\nAppliances can have more than one function.<br />\r\nAppliances
    intended for normal household and similar use and that can also be used by laypersons
    in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.
    Examples of such appliances are glue pots with a water jacket, livestock feed
    boilers and sterilizers.<br />\r\nIf the appliance is intended to be used professionally
    to process food for commercial consumption, the appliance is not considered to
    be for household and similar use only.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar
    authorities and additional national requirements for pressure vessels are specified
    for pressure cookers.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– frying
    pans and deep fat fryers (IEC 60335-2-13);<br />\r\n– storage water heaters (IEC
    60335-2-21);<br />\r\n– instantaneous water heaters (IEC 60335-2-35);<br />\r\n–
    surface-cleaning appliances employing liquids or steam (IEC 60335-2-54);<br />\r\n–
    portable immersion heaters (IEC 60335-2-74);<br />\r\n– commercial dispensing
    appliances and vending machines (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n– appliances for medical
    purposes (IEC 60601);<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– appliances for high-frequency heating;<br />\r\n–
    pressure sterilizers;<br />\r\n– humidifiers for household and similar use (IEC
    60335-2-98).<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition
    published in 2012, Amendment 1:2016 and Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment
    with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text
    (Clause 1, 8.1.2, 11.7.104, 15.2, 15.101);<br />\r\nc) introduction of surface
    temperature limits (3.6.102, 7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.14, 7.15, 11.1, 11.3, 11.101);<br
    />\r\nd) addition of instructions for appliances with liquid containers made from
    polycarbonate material and kettles (7.12);<br />\r\ne) introduction of test probe
    18 and clarification of the application force for test probes in 20.103;<br />\r\nf)
    improvement of spillage test for coffee-makers with a removable coffee pot and
    addition of test for appliances with a surface that will support a cup of vessel
    (15.2);<br />\r\ng) specified that kettles are to be tested with NaCl instead
    of the spillage solution (15.2);<br />\r\nh) addition of spillage tests for built-in
    appliances (15.104, 15.105);<br />\r\ni) addition of compliance criteria for impact
    testing on glass containers of kettles, coffee-makers and tea makers (21.1);<br
    />\r\nj) addition of requirements for the strength of kettle handles (21.101,
    21.102);<br />\r\nk) clarification of requirements for drain holes (22.6);<br
    />\r\nl) added requirements for remote operation (22.49, 22.51);<br />\r\nm) clarification
    of test method evaluation of appliance couplers for cordless appliances (22.103);<br
    />\r\nn) clarification of requirements for pressure cookers (22.108, 22.108.1,
    22.108.2, 22.109);<br />\r\no) revision of requirements for the maximum rotation
    angle of a frothing or hot water nozzle (22.115, R.2.2.5, R.2.2.9);<br />\r\np)
    addition of requirements for programmable electronic circuits that limit the number
    of heating elements and motors able to operate at the same time (22.116, R.2.2.5,
    R.2.2.9).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
