  content: IEC/TS 62257-7-3:2008(E) specifies the general requirements for the selection,
    sizing, erection and operation of generator sets in decentralized rural electrification
    systems. Applies to all low voltage combustion engine electricity generator sets
    with a rated power up to 100 kVA, and designed for supplying electrical power
    to isolated sites used in systems as described in IEC/TS 62257-2.
