abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 14143-5:2004 describes the characteristics of Functional Domains
    and the procedures by which characteristics of Functional User Requirements (FUR)
    can be used to determine Functional Domains. Two example methods for implementing
    these principles are provided in the annexes.<br /><br />\r\nEither of the methods
    may be used directly, or by using Functional Domains defined locally by:<br />\r\nFSM
    Method to determine if a particular FSM Method is applicable to the Functional
    Domain(s) represented by their specific FUR;<br />\r\nDescribing, for a given
    set of FUR, the Functional Domain to which the FUR belong; and<br />\r\nFSM Method
    owners and designers describing the Functional Domain(s) to which the FSM Method
    can be applied as outlined in ISO/IEC 14143-1:1998."
