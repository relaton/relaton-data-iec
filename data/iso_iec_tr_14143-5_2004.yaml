abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 14143-5:2004 describes the characteristics of Functional Domains
    and the procedures by which characteristics of Functional User Requirements (FUR)
    can be used to determine Functional Domains. Two example methods for implementing
    these principles are provided in the annexes.Either of the methods may be used
    directly, or by using Functional Domains defined locally by:FSM Method to determine
    if a particular FSM Method is applicable to the Functional Domain(s) represented
    by their specific FUR;Describing, for a given set of FUR, the Functional Domain
    to which the FUR belong; andFSM Method owners and designers describing the Functional
    Domain(s) to which the FSM Method can be applied as outlined in ISO/IEC 14143-1:1998.
