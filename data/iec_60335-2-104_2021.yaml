    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br
    />\r\nIEC 60335-2-104:2021 deals with the safety of electrical recovery and/or
    recycle equipment to recover and/or recycle refrigerant from air conditioning
    and refrigeration equipment. This applies to air-conditioning, heat-pumps and
    refrigeration equipment incorporating open drive or motor-compressors, their maximum
    rated voltages being not more than 300 V for single phase appliances and 600 V
    for all other equipment.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household
    use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by service personnel in shops, in light industry and on farms,
    are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nThe appliances referenced above
    may consist of one or more factory made assemblies. If provided in more than one
    assembly, the separate assemblies are to be used together, and the requirements
    are based on the use of matched assemblies.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 1 - The scope has been
    edited to reflect that \"appliance\" in this document means recovery and/or recycle
    equipment to recover and/or recycle refrigerant from air-conditioning and refrigeration
    equipment.<br />\r\nb) Clause 2 - Normative references were added.<br />\r\nc)
    Clause 3 - Some definitions were deleted, some were added.<br />\r\nd) Subclause
    7.1 - Some markings were deleted, some were added.<br />\r\ne) Subclause 7.6 -
    Symbols were added for “read operator’s manual”, “operator’s manual; operating
    instructions” including coloring are placed in visible location; maximum allowable
    pressure markings following X MPa.<br />\r\nf) Subclause 19.11.4 was modified.<br
    />\r\ng) Subclause 21.1 was modified.<br />\r\nh) Subclause 21.2 was modified.<br
    />\r\ni) Subclause 22.102 was modified.<br />\r\nj) Subclause 22.104.1.1 was modified.<br

    Subclause 30.2 was moved to Clause 29.<br />\r\nq) Annex AA was deleted and replaced
    with Annex AA.<br />\r\nr) Annex BB was deleted and replaced with former IEC 60335-2-104
    Annex CC (normative) Compatibility requirements following addition to Annex BB.<br
