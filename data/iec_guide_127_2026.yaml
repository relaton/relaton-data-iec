abstract:
- content: "IEC GUIDE 127:2026 provides recommendations on drafting standards so as
    to include safety aspects where humans, machines, and the operational context
    mutually associate to mitigate risk by providing protective measures in standards.<br
    />\r\nThis document supplements ISO/IEC Guide 51 and IEC Guide 116 by specifying
    additional recommendations relevant to collaborative safety-related aspects in
    standards.<br />\r\nThis document supplements, in particular, the safeguarding
    and complementary protective measures (Step 2) and can include protective measures
    taken by the user (e.g. provision and use of additional safeguards), both illustrated
    in IEC Guide 116:2018, Figure 5.<br />\r\nThis document is not applicable for
    the development of publications related to medical devices, which is covered by
    ISO/IEC Guide 63 [1].<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The safety implications of a cybersecurity
    attack that has potential to cause harm to humans are included in IEC Guide 116.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 The IEC Standardization Management Board (SMB) has decided that Guides
    such as this one can have mandatory requirements which shall be followed by all
    IEC committees developing technical work that falls within the scope of the Guide,
    as well as guidance which may or may not be followed. The mandatory requirements
    in this Guide are identified by the use of \"shall\". Statements that are only
    for guidance are identified by using the verb \"should\". (See ISO/IEC Directives,
    IEC Supplement:2021, A.1.1.)"
