  content: "IEC 60728-12:2017(E) applies to the radiation characteristics and immunity
    to electromagnetic disturbance of cable networks for television signals, sound
    signals and interactive services and covers the frequency range 0,15 MHz to 3,5
    GHz. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2001.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    IEC 60728-12 with its methods of measurement and EMC performance requirements
    is explicitly dedicated to “under operating conditions (in situ)” to ensure the
    ongoing EMC integrity of cable networks.<br />\r\nb) The first intermediate frequency
    range (1st IF range) for satellite signal transmission was extended to cover now
    frequencies from 950 MHz up to 3 500 MHz.<br />\r\nc) The method of measurement
    and the requirements for in-band immunity were extended taking into account the
    new EMC environment due to the allocation of broadband wireless services in the
    frequency band 694 MHz to 862 MHz. As a consequence, the limits of in-band immunity
    were specified for analogue and additionally for digital signals in this frequency
    range.<br />\r\nd) The substitution method of measurement (power method) was deleted.<br
    />\r\ne) EMC measurements below 30 MHz were deleted.<br />\r\nf) New Annex D “Measurements
    at other distances than the standard distance of 3 m”.<br />\r\ng) New Annex E
    “GPS based leakage detection system for cable networks”."
