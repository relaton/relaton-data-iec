abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29167-12:2015 defines the crypto suite for ECC-DH for the ISO/IEC
    18000 air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices.
    Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite with Diffie-Hellmann-based authentication
    using ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) over binary fields for security for RFID
    devices that may be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and
    application standards.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29167-12:2015 specifies a crypto suite for
    ECC-DH for air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite is defined in alignment
    with existing air interfaces.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29167-12:2015 defines various authentication
    methods and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag and an Interrogator may support
    one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported.</p>"
