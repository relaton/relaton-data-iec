abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 4922-2:2024 This document specifies the processes for secure multiparty
    computation mechanisms based on the secret sharing techniques which are specified
    in ISO/IEC 19592-2. Secure multiparty computation based on secret sharing can
    be used for confidential data processing. Examples of possible applications include
    collaborative data analytics or machine learning where data are kept secret, secure
    auctions where each bidding price is hidden, and performing cryptographic operations
    where the secrecy of the private keys is maintained.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    the mechanisms including but not limited to addition, subtraction, multiplication
    by a constant, shared random number generation, and multiplication with their
    parameters and properties. This document describes how to perform a secure function
    evaluation using these mechanisms and secret sharing techniques."
