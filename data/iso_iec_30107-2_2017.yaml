abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 30107-2:2017 defines data formats for conveying the mechanism
    used in biometric presentation attack detection and for conveying the results
    of presentation attack detection methods. The attacks considered in the ISO/IEC
    30107 series take place at the sensor during the presentation and collection of
    the biometric characteristics. Any other attacks are outside the scope of this
    document.</p><p>ISO/IEC 30107-2:2017 contains the following data formats: a binary
    format and an XML schema. The data interchange formats in this document are generic,
    in that they may be applied and used in a wide range of application areas. No
    application-specific requirements are addressed here.</p><p>Provisions for the
    cryptographic protection of the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality of
    stored and transmitted presentation attack detection data are beyond the scope
    of this document.</p><p>NOTE While addressing security is out of the scope of
    this document, PAD data may be protected by encoding them into a biometric information
    record (see ISO/IEC 19785-1) that includes an optional security block.</p>"
