abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-20:2008 defines a scene description format (LASeR) and
    an aggregation format (SAF) respectively suitable for representing and delivering
    rich-media services to resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones.</p><p>LASeR
    aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the scene description
    level. LASeR supports:</p><ul><li>an optimized set of objects inherited from SVG
    to describe rich-media scenes,</li><li>a small set of key compatible extensions
    over SVG,</li><li>the ability to encode and transmit a LASeR stream and then reconstruct
    SVG content,</li><li>dynamic updating of the scene to achieve a reactive, smooth
    and continuous service,</li><li>simple yet efficient compression to improve delivery
    and parsing times, as well as storage size, one of the design goals being to allow
    both for a direct implementation of the SDL as documented, as well as for a decoder
    compliant with ISO/IEC 23001-1 to decode the LASeR bitstream,</li><li>an efficient
    interface with audio and visual streams with frame-accurate synchronization,</li><li>use
    of any font format, including the OpenType industry standard, and</li><li>easy
    conversion from other popular rich-media formats in order to leverage existing
    content and developer communities.</li></ul><p>Technology selection criteria for
    LASeR included compression efficiency, but also code and memory footprint and
    performance. Other aims included: scalability, adaptability to the user context,
    extensibility of the format, ability to define small profiles, feasibility of
    a J2ME implementation, error resilience and safety of implementations.</p><p>SAF
    aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the interface
    between media/scene description and existing transport protocols:</p><ul><li>simple
    aggregation of any type of stream,</li><li>signaling of MPEG and non-MPEG streams,</li><li>optimized
    packet headers for bandwidth-limited networks,</li><li>easy mapping to popular
    streaming formats,</li><li>cache management capability, and</li><li>extensibility.</li></ul><p>SAF
    has been designed to complement LASeR for simple, interactive services, bringing:</p><ul><li>efficient
    and dynamic packaging to cope with high latency networks,</li><li>media interleaving,
    and</li><li>synchronization support with a very low overhead.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    14496-20:2008 defines the usage of SAF for LASeR content; however, LASeR can be
    used independently from SAF.</p>"
