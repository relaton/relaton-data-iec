abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    14496-20:2008 defines a scene description format (LASeR) and an aggregation format
    (SAF) respectively suitable for representing and delivering rich-media services
    to resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones.<br />\r\nLASeR aims at
    fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the scene description
    level. LASeR supports:<br />\r\nan optimized set of objects inherited from SVG
    to describe rich-media scenes,<br />\r\na small set of key compatible extensions
    over SVG,<br />\r\nthe ability to encode and transmit a LASeR stream and then
    reconstruct SVG content,<br />\r\ndynamic updating of the scene to achieve a reactive,
    smooth and continuous service,<br />\r\nsimple yet efficient compression to improve
    delivery and parsing times, as well as storage size, one of the design goals being
    to allow both for a direct implementation of the SDL as documented, as well as
    for a decoder compliant with ISO/IEC 23001-1 to decode the LASeR bitstream,<br
    />\r\nan efficient interface with audio and visual streams with frame-accurate
    synchronization,<br />\r\nuse of any font format, including the OpenType industry
    standard, and<br />\r\neasy conversion from other popular rich-media formats in
    order to leverage existing content and developer communities.<br />\r\nTechnology
    selection criteria for LASeR included compression efficiency, but also code and
    memory footprint and performance. Other aims included: scalability, adaptability
    to the user context, extensibility of the format, ability to define small profiles,
    feasibility of a J2ME implementation, error resilience and safety of implementations.<br
    />\r\nSAF aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the
    interface between media/scene description and existing transport protocols:<br
    />\r\nsimple aggregation of any type of stream,<br />\r\nsignaling of MPEG and
    non-MPEG streams,<br />\r\noptimized packet headers for bandwidth-limited networks,<br
    />\r\neasy mapping to popular streaming formats,<br />\r\ncache management capability,
    and<br />\r\nextensibility.<br />\r\nSAF has been designed to complement LASeR
    for simple, interactive services, bringing:<br />\r\nefficient and dynamic packaging
    to cope with high latency networks,<br />\r\nmedia interleaving, and<br />\r\nsynchronization
    support with a very low overhead.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 14496-20:2008 defines the usage
    of SAF for LASeR content; however, LASeR can be used independently from SAF."
