  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the air interface for radio frequency
    identification (RFID) devices operating as an active RF tag in the 433 MHz band
    used in item management applications. It provides a common technical specification
    for RFID devices that can be used by ISO technical committees developing RFID
    application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 is intended to allow for compatibility
    and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in
    the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the forward and return
    link parameters for technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating
    frequency, operating channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power,
    spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy,
    bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency
    hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009
    further defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.</p>"
