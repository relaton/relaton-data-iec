abstract:
- content: "This document:<br />\r\n- defines the rules applicable for certification
    of the implementation of systems engineering, software engineering and service
    delivery processes complying with the requirements given in ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m,
    Profile specifications; and<br />\r\n- provides the necessary information and
    confidence to customers about the way certification of their suppliers has been
    granted.<br />\r\nCertification of the implementation of systems and software
    engineering processes (named \"certification\" in this document) is a third-party
    conformity assessment activity (see ISO/IEC 17000:2004, 5.5). Bodies performing
    this activity are therefore third-party conformity assessment bodies (named \"certification
    body/bodies\" in this document).<br />\r\nNOTE This document is primarily intended
    to be used as a criteria document for the accreditation or peer assessment of
    certification bodies which seek to be recognized as being competent to certify
    that a Very Small Entity (VSE) complies with ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m, Profile Specifications.
    Some of its requirements could also be found useful by any other parties involved
    in the conformity assessment of such certification bodies.<br />\r\nSystems and
    software engineering processes certification does not attest the fitness of the
    systems and or software products offered by a VSE.<br />\r\nIt is important to
    note that certification of the implementation of systems and software engineering
    processes according to ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m, Profile Specifications, is a process
    certification and not a management systems certification neither a product certification.<br
    />\r\nCertification of the implementation of systems and software engineering
    processes (SEP) of a very small entity (VSE) is one means of providing assurance
    that the VSE has implemented systems and software engineering processes to the
    development or maintenance of systems and or software.<br />\r\nRequirements for
    the implementation of SEP can originate from a number of sources, and this International
    Standard has been developed to assist in the certification of SEP that fulfil
    the requirements of ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m, Profile Specifications. The contents of
    this document can also be used to support certification of SEP that are based
    on other sets of specified SEP requirements.<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    for use by bodies that carry out audit and certification of SEP for VSEs. It gives
    generic requirements for such certification bodies performing audit and certification
    in the field of SEP for VSEs. Such bodies are referred to as certification bodies.
    This wording is not intended to be an obstacle to the use of this document by
    bodies with other designations that undertake activities covered by the scope
    of this document. Indeed, this document is intended to be usable by anyone involved
    in the assessment of SEP for VSEs.<br />\r\nCertification activities involve the
    audit of a VSE's SEP. The form of attestation of conformity of a VSE's SEP to
    a specific lifecycle profile standard setting the applicable SEP (for example
    ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 or ISO/IEC 29110‑4-3) or other specified requirements are normally
    a certification document or a certificate.<br />\r\nThis certification is outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC 29169 to the assessment to process quality characteristics
    and organizational maturity, and does not cover the results of process assessment.
    ISO/IEC 29110-3-3 describes such a scheme.<br />\r\nIt is for the VSE being certified
    to develop its own processes (including ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m SEP), other sets of
    specified SEP requirements, other processes and it is for the VSE to decide how
    the various components of these will be arranged. It is therefore for certification
    bodies that operate in accordance with this document to take into account the
    culture and practices of their clients with respect to the implementation of SEP,
    including, if applicable, within the wider organization."
