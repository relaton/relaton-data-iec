abstract:
- content: <p>This document:</p><p>- defines the rules applicable for certification
    of the implementation of systems engineering, software engineering and service
    delivery processes complying with the requirements given in ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m,
    Profile specifications; and</p><p>- provides the necessary information and confidence
    to customers about the way certification of their suppliers has been granted.</p><p>Certification
    of the implementation of systems and software engineering processes (named "certification"
    in this document) is a third-party conformity assessment activity (see ISO/IEC
    17000:2004, 5.5). Bodies performing this activity are therefore third-party conformity
    assessment bodies (named "certification body/bodies" in this document).</p><p>NOTE
    This document is primarily intended to be used as a criteria document for the
    accreditation or peer assessment of certification bodies which seek to be recognized
    as being competent to certify that a Very Small Entity (VSE) complies with ISO/IEC
    29110‑4-m, Profile Specifications. Some of its requirements could also be found
    useful by any other parties involved in the conformity assessment of such certification
    bodies.</p><p>Systems and software engineering processes certification does not
    attest the fitness of the systems and or software products offered by a VSE.</p><p>It
    is important to note that certification of the implementation of systems and software
    engineering processes according to ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m, Profile Specifications,
    is a process certification and not a management systems certification neither
    a product certification.</p><p>Certification of the implementation of systems
    and software engineering processes (SEP) of a very small entity (VSE) is one means
    of providing assurance that the VSE has implemented systems and software engineering
    processes to the development or maintenance of systems and or software.</p><p>Requirements
    for the implementation of SEP can originate from a number of sources, and this
    International Standard has been developed to assist in the certification of SEP
    that fulfil the requirements of ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m, Profile Specifications. The
    contents of this document can also be used to support certification of SEP that
    are based on other sets of specified SEP requirements.</p><p>This document is
    intended for use by bodies that carry out audit and certification of SEP for VSEs.
    It gives generic requirements for such certification bodies performing audit and
    certification in the field of SEP for VSEs. Such bodies are referred to as certification
    bodies. This wording is not intended to be an obstacle to the use of this document
    by bodies with other designations that undertake activities covered by the scope
    of this document. Indeed, this document is intended to be usable by anyone involved
    in the assessment of SEP for VSEs.</p><p>Certification activities involve the
    audit of a VSE's SEP. The form of attestation of conformity of a VSE's SEP to
    a specific lifecycle profile standard setting the applicable SEP (for example
    ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 or ISO/IEC 29110‑4-3) or other specified requirements are normally
    a certification document or a certificate.</p><p>This certification is outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC 29169 to the assessment to process quality characteristics
    and organizational maturity, and does not cover the results of process assessment.
    ISO/IEC 29110-3-3 describes such a scheme.</p><p>It is for the VSE being certified
    to develop its own processes (including ISO/IEC 29110‑4-m SEP), other sets of
    specified SEP requirements, other processes and it is for the VSE to decide how
    the various components of these will be arranged. It is therefore for certification
    bodies that operate in accordance with this document to take into account the
    culture and practices of their clients with respect to the implementation of SEP,
    including, if applicable, within the wider organization.</p>
