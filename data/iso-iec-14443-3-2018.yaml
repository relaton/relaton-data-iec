    <p>This document describes the following:</p>
    <p>-      polling for proximity cards or objects (PICCs) entering the field of a proximity coupling device (PCD);</p>
    <p>-      the byte format, the frames and timing used during the initial phase of communication between PCDs and PICCs;</p>
    <p>-      the initial Request and Answer to Request command content;</p>
    <p>-      methods to detect and communicate with one PICC among several PICCs (anticollision);</p>
    <p>-      other parameters required to initialize communications between a PICC and PCD;</p>
    <p>-      optional means to ease and speed up the selection of one PICC among several PICCs based on application criteria;</p>
    <p>-      optional capability to allow a device to alternate between the functions of a PICC and a PCD to communicate with a PCD or a PICC, respectively. A device which implements this capability is called a PXD.</p>
    <p>Protocol and commands used by higher layers and by applications and which are used after the initial phase are described in ISO/IEC 14443‑4.</p>
    <p>This document is applicable to PICCs of Type A and of Type B (as described in ISO/IEC 14443‑2), to PCDs (as described in ISO/IEC 14443‑2) and to PXDs.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1    Part of the timing of data communication is defined in ISO/IEC 14443‑2.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2    Test methods for this document are defined in ISO/IEC 10373‑6.</p>
