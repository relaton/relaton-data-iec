  content: "IEC 62541-11:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<div>IEC 62541-11:2020 is part
    of the OPC Unified Architecture standard series and defines the information model
    associated with Historical Access (HA). It particularly includes additional and
    complementary descriptions of the NodeClasses and Attributes needed for Historical
    Access, additional standard Properties, and other information and behaviour.<br
    />\r\nThe complete AddressSpace Model including all NodeClasses and Attributes
    is specified in IEC 62541-3. The predefined Information Model is defined in IEC
    62541-5. The Services to detect and access historical data and events, and description
    of the ExtensibleParameter types are specified in IEC 62541-4. This document includes
    functionality to compute and return Aggregates like minimum, maximum, average
    etc. The Information Model and the concrete working of Aggregates are defined
    in IEC 62541-13. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) a new method for determining the first historical point has been added;<br
    />\r\nb) added clarifications on how to add, insert, modify, and delete annotations.</div>"
