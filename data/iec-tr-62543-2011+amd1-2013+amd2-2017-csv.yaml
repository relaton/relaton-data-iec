  content: "IEC/TR 62543:2011+A1:2013+A2:2017 gives general guidance on the subject
    of voltage-sourced converters used for transmission of power by high voltage direct
    current (HVDC). It describes converters that are not only voltage-sourced (containing
    a capacitive energy storage medium and where the polarity of d.c. voltage remains
    fixed) but also self-commutated, using semiconductor devices which can both be
    turned on and turned off by control action. The scope includes 2-level and 3-level
    converters with pulse-width modulation (PWM), along with multi-level converters,
    but excludes 2-level and 3-level converters operated without PWM, in square-wave
    output mode. HVDC power transmission using voltage sourced converters is known
    as \"VSC transmission\". The various types of circuit that can be used for VSC
    transmission are described in the report, along with their principal operational
    characteristics and typical applications. The overall aim is to provide a guide
    for purchasers to assist with the task of specifying a VSC transmission scheme.
    Line-commutated and current-sourced converters are specifically excluded from
    this report. This technical report cancels and replaces IEC/PAS 62543:2008 (Ed.1)
    which was published by IEC and CIGRÉ jointly, and combined with engineering experience.<br
    />\r\n<strong>This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2011),
    its amendment 1 (2013) and its amendment 2 (2017). Therefore, no need to order
    amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>"
