abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11694-5:2006 is one of a series of International Standards specifying
    the parameters for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage
    and interchange of digital data.ISO/IEC 11694 recognises the existence of different
    methods of recording and reading information on optical memory cards, the characteristics
    of which are specific to the recording method employed. ISO/IEC 11694-5:2006 is
    specific to optical memory cards using the linear recording method and specifies
    a data format for information interchange for applications using ISO/IEC 11694-4,
    Annex B.
