abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 29125:2017+A1:2020 This document specifies the use of generic
    balanced cabling for customer premises, as specified in the ISO/IEC 11801 series,
    for remote powering of terminal equipment. It provides guidance on new cabling
    installations and renovations. The customer premises may encompass one of more
    buildings or may be within a building that contains more than one organization.
    The cabling may be installed prior to the selection of remote powering equipment
    or powered terminal equipment. This consolidated version consists of the first
    edition (2017) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-12)
