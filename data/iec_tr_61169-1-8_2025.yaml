abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61169-1-8:2025 provides a test method for voltage standing wave
    ratio (VSWR, hereinafter) of single RF connector by double-connector method. This
    document is applicable to single RF cable connectors and single microstrip RF
    connectors as well as single adapters if an estimation of the VSWR of a single
    completely installed RF-connector is used and a time domain feature is not available
    on the vector network analyzer.
