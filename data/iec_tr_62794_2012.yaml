abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62794:2012(E) describes a reference model which comprises the abstract
    description for automation assets and structural and operational relationships.
    The reference model is the basis for the electronic representation of certain
    aspects of a plant. It covers the systems (excluding facilities) used to make
    products, but it does not cover raw production material, work pieces in process,
    nor end products.
