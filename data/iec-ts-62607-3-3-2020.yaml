  content: "IEC 62607:2020, a Technical Specification, provides a method for determining
    the fluorescence lifetime of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) using the time correlated
    single photon counting (TCSPC) technique. TCSPC is suitable for testing fluorescence
    lifetime in the range from picoseconds to nanoseconds. This document is only applicable
    to liquid samples that are stable dispersions of QDs. It is not applicable to
    solid samples.<br />\r\nThis document includes:<br />\r\n– outlines of the experimental
    procedures,<br />\r\n– data processing, and<br />\r\n– case study."
