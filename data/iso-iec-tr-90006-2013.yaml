    <p>ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001:2008 to service management for IT services. Examples provided in the guidelines are for service management of IT services.</p>
    <p>Additionally, ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 provides guidelines for the alignment and integration of a QMS and SMS in organizations where services are being delivered to internal or external customers. The guidelines about integration provided can be applicable to a scope including IT services and other non-IT services as required.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 provides a comparison of the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. It highlights those areas where there is the greatest similarity between the two management systems, and where there are differences between the two.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 cites and explains the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 in its application to service management and its integration with ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011, but does not add to or otherwise change the requirements of ISO 9001 or ISO/IEC 20000-1.</p>
    <p>The guidelines provided in ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 are not intended to be used as criteria for conformity assessments or audits.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 can apply to organizations of all sizes, sectors, and types with different organizational forms or business models.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 can be used by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>auditors and assessors looking for guidelines on audits for ISO 9001:2008 with a scope that includes services and service management;</li>
    <li>auditors and assessors looking for guidelines on integrated audits for ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 with a scope that includes services and service management;</li>
    <li>organizations implementing a QMS with a scope that includes services and service management;</li>
    <li>organizations implementing an integrated management system using the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011.</li>

    <p>ISO/IEC TR 90006:2013 provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001:2008 to service management for IT services. Examples provided in the guidelines are for service management of IT services.</p>
    <p>Because ISO/IEC 20000‑1 and ISO 9001 can be applied not only to IT services but to all services, they do not use terminology referring to IT services. Throughout this Technical Report, the terminology of ISO/IEC 20000‑1 is used without reference to IT, i.e. service, service management and service provider. The guidelines in this Technical Report can also be useful to support a QMS, SMS or integrated management system for other non-IT services.</p>
    <p>Additionally, this Technical Report provides guidelines for the alignment and integration of a QMS and SMS in organizations where services are being delivered to internal or external customers. The guidelines about integration provided in Annex C can be applicable to a scope including IT services and other non-IT services as required.</p>
    <p>This Technical Report provides a comparison of the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011. It highlights those areas where there is the greatest similarity between the two management systems, and where there are differences between the two.</p>

    <p>This Technical Report can apply to organizations of all sizes, sectors, and types with different organizational forms or business models.</p>
    <p>This Technical Report can be used by:</p>
    <p>a)    auditors and assessors looking for guidelines on audits for ISO 9001:2008 with a scope that includes services and service management;</p>
    <p>b)    auditors and assessors looking for guidelines on integrated audits for ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 with a scope that includes services and service management;</p>
    <p>c)    organizations implementing a QMS with a scope that includes services and service management;</p>
