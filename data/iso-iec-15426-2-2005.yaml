    <p>ISO/IEC 15426-2:2005 defines test methods and minimum accuracy criteria applicable to verifiers using the methodologies of ISO/IEC 15415 for multi-row bar code symbols and two-dimensional matrix symbologies, and specifies reference calibration standards against which these should be tested. It provides for testing of representative samples of the equipment.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15426-2:2005 is intended to be similar in technical content (mutatis mutandis) to the linear bar code verifier conformance standard, ISO/IEC 15426-1, on which it has been based. It is to be read in conjunction with the symbology specification applicable to the bar code symbol being tested, which provides symbology-specific detail necessary for its application.</p>
