  content: "IEC 62442-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62442-1:2022
    defines a measurement and calculation method of the total input power for controlgear-lamp
    circuits when operating with their associated fluorescent lamp(s). The calculation
    method for the efficiency of the lamp controlgear is also defined. This document
    applies to electrical controlgear-lamp circuits consisting only of the controlgear
    and the lamp(s). It is intended for use on DC supplies up to 1 000 V and/or AC
    supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- this edition has been harmonized with IEC
    62442-2 and IEC 62442­-3;<br />\r\n- the reference to and use of the measurement
    methods for non-active power consumption in accordance with IEC 63103 have been
    added."
