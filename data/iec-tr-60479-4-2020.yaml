  content: "IEC TR 60479-4:2020 (E) summarizes the basic parameters for lightning
    and its variability insofar as they apply to human beings and livestock.<br />\r\nThe
    possible direct and indirect interactions of strikes with bodies of living beings
    are indicated. The resulting effects caused by lightning currents for the organism
    are described.<br />\r\nThis document shows the differences of effects on human
    beings and livestock due to lightning strokes versus those effects of electric
    shocks derived from electrical systems.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) lightning occurence and climatory
    effects around the world are depicted;<br />\r\nb) direct strike description is
    extended;<br />\r\nc) step voltage effects are expanded;<br />\r\nd) upward streamer
    explanation is enhanced;<br />\r\ne) other direct or indirect related effects
    to lightning injuries to the human body are specified;<br />\r\nf) various safety
    procedures and related possibilities with respect to the personsal danger of lightning
    are presented."
