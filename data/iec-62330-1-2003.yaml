  content: 'This part of IEC 62330 specifies the content, format, and recording method
    of the data blocks containing HD compressed video data defined in part 2, audio,
    and associated data which form the helical records on 12,65 mm (0,5 in) tape in
    cassettes as specified in IEC 61835. In addition, this standard specifies the
    content, format, and recording method of the longitudinal record containing tracking
    information for the scanning head associated with the helical records, and also
    the longitudinal cue audio, and time and control code. One video channel of HD
    compressed video data and four independent audio channels are recorded in the
    digital format. Each of these channels is designed to be capable of independent
    editing. The HD compressed video data are derived from the following HD video
    signal: 1080 line / 59,94 Hz field frequency interlace system 720 line / 59,94
    Hz frame frequency progressive system'
