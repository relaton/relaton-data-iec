  content: Establishes an uniform specification and type testing requirements for
    4- to 10-pole connectors, containing 2 or 4 balanced shielded pairs for frequencies
    up to 600 MHz and optional 2 unshielded contacts for lower frequencies or power
    line interconnections. Provides solutions for increasing data rates and establishes
    highest reliability interconnection under harsh environmental conditions for high
    speed data transmission in industrial environments.
