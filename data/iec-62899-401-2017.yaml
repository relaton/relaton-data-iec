  content: "IEC 62899-401:2017(E) provides an introduction to the rest of the IEC
    62899-4XX series and explains its modular structure. The IEC 62899-4XX series
    establishes requirements for the printability of printed electronics. These requirements
    are stated as measurement of quality, reproducibility, analysis and compliance
    test methods, as well as measuring methods for environmental conditions.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe IEC 62899-4XX series specifies the measurements and the requirements
    of both the quality and the reproducibility of printed patterns as the result
    of the interaction of printing media, inks, substrate, and environmental conditions."
