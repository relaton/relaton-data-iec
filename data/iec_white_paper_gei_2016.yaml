abstract:
- content: "Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the
    world faces. However, one fifth of the world population still lacks access to
    energy.<br /><br />\r\nThe interconnection of grids would open up an unprecedented
    opportunity to globally share the resources of the whole planet, bringing clean
    energy to everybody, everywhere in the world.<br /><br />\r\nGlobal energy interconnection
    (GEI) is technically highly complex. It will require a level of dependability
    never seen before. International Standards inherently contain solutions that will
    help pre-address this complexity and they will play a crucial role in mastering
    dependability upfront.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper aims to assess the worldwide
    needs, benefits, policies and preconditions for GEI. It examines the readiness
    of potential markets and identifies technical and business trends as well as hurdles.
    It analyzes and compares several global transmission scenarios and evaluates their
    impact on energy supply, the environment, technologies, policies as well as standards
    development, providing recommendations to all stakeholders.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    White Paper was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) Global Energy
    Interconnection project team with major contributions from the International Energy
    Agency (IEA) and State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC
    White Paper is available for free download."
