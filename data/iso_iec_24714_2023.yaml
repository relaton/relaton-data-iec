abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24714:2023 This document gives general guidance for the stages
    in the life cycle of a systemâ€™s biometric and associated elements. This covers
    the following:<br />\r\n- the capture and design of initial requirements, including
    legal frameworks;<br />\r\n- development and deployment;<br />\r\n- operations,
    including enrolment and subsequent usage;<br />\r\n- interrelationships with other
    systems;<br />\r\n- related data storage and security of data;<br />\r\n- data
    updates and maintenance;<br />\r\n- training and awareness;<br />\r\n- system
    evaluation and audit;<br />\r\n- controlled system expiration.<br />\r\nThe areas
    addressed are limited to the design and implementation of biometric technologies
    with respect to the following:<br />\r\n- legal and societal constraints on the
    use of biometric data;<br />\r\n- accessibility for the widest population;<br
    />\r\n- health and safety, addressing the concerns of users regarding direct potential
    hazards as well as the possibility of the misuse of inferred data from biometric
    information.<br />\r\nThis document is intended for planners, implementers and
    system operators of biometric applications.<br />\r\nSpecification and assessment
    of government policy are not within the scope of this document. However, this
    document is intended to be beneficial to public authorities when deploying biometric
    systems."
