abstract:
- content: The technology of bar coding is based on the recognition of patterns encoded
    in bars and spaces of defined dimensions. There are numerous methods of encoding
    information in bar code form, known as symbologies. Code 128 is one such symbology.
    The rules defining the translation of characters into bar and space patterns,
    and other essential features of each symbology, are known as the symbology specification.In
    the past, symbology specifications were developed and published by a number of
    organizations, resulting in certain instances in conflicting requirements for
    certain symbologies.Manufacturers of bar code equipment and users of bar code
    technology require publicly available standard symbology specifications to which
    they can refer when developing equipment and software.ISO/IEC 15417:2007 specifies
    the requirements for the bar code symbology known as Code 128. It specifies Code
    128 symbology characteristics, data character encodation, dimensions, decoding
    algorithms and the parameters to be defined by applications. It specifies the
    symbology identifier prefix strings for Code 128 symbols.
