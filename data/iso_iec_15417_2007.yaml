abstract:
- content: "<p>The technology of bar coding is based on the recognition of patterns
    encoded in bars and spaces of defined dimensions. There are numerous methods of
    encoding information in bar code form, known as symbologies. Code 128 is one such
    symbology. The rules defining the translation of characters into bar and space
    patterns, and other essential features of each symbology, are known as the symbology
    specification.</p><p>In the past, symbology specifications were developed and
    published by a number of organizations, resulting in certain instances in conflicting
    requirements for certain symbologies.</p><p>Manufacturers of bar code equipment
    and users of bar code technology require publicly available standard symbology
    specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and software.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15417:2007 specifies the requirements for the bar code symbology known as Code
    128. It specifies Code 128 symbology characteristics, data character encodation,
    dimensions, decoding algorithms and the parameters to be defined by applications.
    It specifies the symbology identifier prefix strings for Code 128 symbols.</p>"
