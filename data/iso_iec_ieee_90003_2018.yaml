abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance for organizations in the application
    of ISO 9001:2015 to the acquisition, supply, development, operation and maintenance
    of computer software and related support services. It does not add to or otherwise
    change the requirements of ISO 9001:2015.</p><p>Annex A provides a table pointing
    to additional guidance on the implementation of ISO 9001:2015, available in ISO/IEC
    JTC 1/SC 7, ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27 and ISO/TC 176 International Standards.</p><p>The
    guidelines provided in this document are not intended to be used as assessment
    criteria in quality management system registration/certification. However, some
    organizations can consider it useful to implement the guidelines proposed in this
    document and can be interested in knowing whether the resultant quality management
    system is compliant or not with this document. In this case, an organization can
    use both this document and ISO 9001 as assessment criteria for quality management
    systems in the software domain.</p>"
