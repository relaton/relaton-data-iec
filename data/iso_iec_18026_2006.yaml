abstract:
- content: ISO 18026:2005 specifies the Spatial Reference Model (SRM) defining relevant
    aspects of spatial positioning and related information processing. The SRM allows
    precise and unambiguous specification of geometric properties such as position
    (location), direction, and distance. The SRM addresses the needs of a broad community
    of users, who have a range of accuracy and performance requirements in computationally
    intensive applications.
