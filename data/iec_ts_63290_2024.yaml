abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63290:2024 provides additional requirements for assemblies in accordance
    with the product standards of the IEC 61439 series (Part 2 onwards) that incorporate
    digital functions and communication, in addition to the conventional electromechanical
    features of assemblies to reflect what is defined within this document as intelligence.
    It specifies the definitions, service conditions, constructional requirements,
    technical characteristics and verification requirements that can be carried out
    in addition to the IEC 61439 series for intelligent low-voltage switchgear and
    controlgear assemblies.
