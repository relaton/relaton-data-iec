abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-14:2025 specifies cables for work area wiring intended to be
    used for transmission of 10 Mb/s over a single twisted pair in channels for distances
    of up to 1 km. The transmission characteristics of these cables are specified
    up to a frequency of 20 MHz and at a temperature of 20Â°C. Depending on the MICE
    environment and the installation conditions, either unscreened or screened cables
    can be used. Furthermore, to consider different maximum transmission lengths,
    two sets of requirements are specified. The cable type A-1000W does not have attenuation
    de-rating compared to the A-1000 type according to IEC 61156-13 and is a design
    supporting up to 1 km channel length. The cable type A-400W has attenuation de-rating
    compared to the A-400 type according to IEC 61156-13. A blank detail specification
    can be found in Annex A.<br />\r\nThe cables covered by this document are intended
    to operate with voltages and currents normally encountered in communication systems.
    While these cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low impedance
    sources, for example the electric power supplies of public utility mains, they
    are intended to be used to support the delivery of DC low voltage remote powering
    applications."
