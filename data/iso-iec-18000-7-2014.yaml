  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18000-7:2014 defines the air interface for radio frequency
    identification (RFID) devices operating as an active RF tag in the 433 MHz band
    used in item management applications. It provides a common technical specification
    for RFID devices that can be used by ISO technical committees developing RFID
    application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2014 is intended to allow for compatibility
    and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in
    the international marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters
    for technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating
    channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power, spurious emissions,
    modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission
    order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence,
    spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines the communications protocol
    used in the air interface.</p>"
