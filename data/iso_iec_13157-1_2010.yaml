abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13157-1:2010 specifies the NFC-SEC secure channel and shared
    secret services for NFCIP-1 and the protocol data units and protocol for those
    services.</p><p>NFC-SEC is exclusively designed for the data exchange protocol
    of ISO/IEC 18092.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13157-1:2010 does not address application-specific
    security mechanisms (as typically needed for smart card related use cases and
    standardized in ISO/IEC 7816). NFC-SEC can complement application-specific security
    mechanisms of ISO/IEC 7816.</p>"
