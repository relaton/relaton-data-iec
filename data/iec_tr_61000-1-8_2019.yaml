abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-1-8:2019, which is a technical report, provides information
    about the current conditions, and project future developments, of prevailing phase
    angles, predominantly for the 3rd and 5th harmonic currents, on public supply
    networks. This objective is accomplished by monitoring a number of networks, and
    efforts to forecast the effects of changes in technologies. This document presents
    information to guide the discussion about the effectiveness of potential mitigation
    techniques and the generalisation of effects of the prevailing angle positions
    of selected current harmonics. This document mainly deals with the phase angles
    of the 3rd and 5th harmonic currents, but also contains information about other
    harmonics.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nKeywords: 3rd and 5th harmonic currents, phase
    angles"
