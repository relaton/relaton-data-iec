  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 11581-41:2014 provides guidance for developers and designers
    creating and/or using icons and provides a basis for the standardization of icons.
    It also provides a framework for creating future International Standards dealing
    with icons as parts of the ISO/IEC 11581 series and for identifying icon-related
    information to be used in any accompanying icon registries. It is intended to
    be used with ISO/IEC 11581-40 to create a registry of icons.</p>"
