  content: 'IEC TR 61948-4:2019 covers the routine testing of radionuclide calibrators
    used in nuclear medicine. Such devices utilise ionisation chambers of the well
    type and a direct readout in units of activity. Requirements and specific methods
    to determine performance parameters are described in IEC 61303. These methods
    are primarily designed for acceptance testing. IEC TR 61948-4:2019 cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical change with
    respect to the previous edition: the test method to determine system linearity
    has been updated to reflect the technical developments of radionuclide calibrators.'
