  content: "IEC 60079-5:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-5:2015 contains
    specific requirements for the construction, testing and marking of electrical
    equipment, parts of electrical equipment and Ex components in the type of protection
    powder filling \"q\", intended for use in explosive gas atmospheres. This standard
    supplements and modifies the general requirements of IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement
    of this standard conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the requirement
    of this standard takes precedence. This standard applies to electrical equipment,
    parts of electrical equipment and Ex components with:<br />\r\n- a rated supply
    current less than or equal to 16 A;<br />\r\n- a rated supply voltage less than
    or equal to 1 000 V;<br />\r\n- a rated power consumption less than or equal to
    1 000 W.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition,
    published in 2007, and constitutes a technical revision. Refer to the Foreword
    of the document for a complete listing of the technical changes between edition
    4.0 and previous edition of the document.<br />\r\nKeywords: electrical equipment
    and Ex components in the type of protection powder filling \"q\""
