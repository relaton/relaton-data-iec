abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63276:2024 specifies methods for the evaluation of the maximum
    export capacity of distributed energy resources (DER) that distribution networks
    can accommodate. It provides guidance on the technical constraints that should
    be considered in evaluating hosting capacity, information required to be collected
    to undertake a hosting capacity evaluation, and evaluation methods. This document
    is applicable to AC distribution networks operating at a nominal frequency of
    50 Hz or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify allowable values of system
    parameters that can be impacted by the addition of DER on a distribution network,
    such as maximum or minimum voltage, maximum current, etc. These values are to
    be determined by the user, from international or national standards, local regulations
    or the like, and used as an input to the evaluation methods described in this
    document. This document is mainly used by distribution system operators (DSO)
    and other organizations with corresponding qualifications and capabilities. The
    evaluation results can serve the DER investors, DSO, energy sector regulators
    and other stakeholders as a decision-making basis."
