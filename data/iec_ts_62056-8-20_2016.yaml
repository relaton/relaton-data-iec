abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62056-8-20:2016(E) specifies a DLMS/COSEM communication profile
    that can be used in a smart metering system in which the Neighbourhood Networks
    (NN) are mesh networks. This profile may be considered as an adaptation and extension
    of the UDP/IP communication profile specified in IEC 62056-9-7:2013. It specifies
    a number of features essential to the efficient operation of a large scale AMI
    using mesh NNs.
