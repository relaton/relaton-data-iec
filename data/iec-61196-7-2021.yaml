  content: "IEC 61196-7:2021 applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies
    the requirements for cables for broadcast and communications technologies (BCT)
    cabling in accordance with ISO/IEC 11801-4 for use in cabled television distribution
    networks operating at temperature between −40 °C and +70 °C and in the frequency
    range from 5 MHz to 6 000 MHz.This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2011. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- extension of frequency
    range up to 6 GHz,<br />\r\n- revised sheath marking and labelling,<br />\r\n-
    a table with typical cable characteristics was added as annex B."
