abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-55:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-55:2021
    deals with the safety of electric appliances for use with aquariums and garden
    ponds for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V, including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that this standard is applicable to
    are<br />\r\n- aerators;<br />\r\n- aquarium heaters;<br />\r\n- automatic food
    dispensers;<br />\r\n- sludge-suction appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended
    for normal household use but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops and in light
    industry and farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as
    is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- pumps (IEC 60335-2-41);<br />\r\n- other
    portable immersion heaters (IEC 60335-2-74);<br />\r\n- luminaires for aquariums
    and garden ponds (IEC 60598-2-18);<br />\r\n- appliances intended for outdoor
    use having a rated power input exceeding 100 W;<br />\r\n- appliances intended
    exclusively for professional use;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in
    locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2002 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been
    converted to normative text or deleted (Clause 1, 5.2, 19.101, 21.1, 21.102, 22.101);<br
    />\r\nc) updated the depth of immersion symbol (7.1, 7.6, 7.12);<br />\r\nd) limits
    on the temperature rise of external accessible surfaces have been introduced (Clause
    11).<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
