abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23290:2004 specifies functions for using an H.323 packet network
    in order to interconnect two Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs)
    forming part of a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). Interconnection
    is achieved by carrying the inter-PINX signalling protocol over the H.323 call
    signalling channel, making use of the protocol tunnelling facilities of H.323,
    and inter-PINX user information (e.g. voice) over logical channels established
    through H.323. Each logical channel usually represents a unidirectional media
    stream conveyed by means of the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). The inter-PINX
    signalling protocol is assumed to be QSIG, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, ISO/IEC
    11582 and other International Standards.   ISO/IEC 23290:2004 provides for an
    on-demand type of interconnection, where a separate H.323 call is established
    at the start of each PISN call and cleared down at the end of that call. A semi-permanent
    scenario where a single H.323 call with an indefinite lifetime carries QSIG on
    behalf of many PISN calls is described as an additional option.   In the scenarios
    covered in ISO/IEC 23290:2004, the PINXs participating in a call are not necessarily
    aware of the H.323 network providing the interconnection, and the features available
    are those of the QSIG network. This is different from a scenario where true interworking
    between QSIG and H.323 (i.e. QSIG-H.323-QSIG) is used to connect two PISNs or
    two parts of the same PISN. In this latter case, all networks participate in a
    call on equal terms, and features are limited to those available in all networks
    and supported by the gateways. This latter scenario is outside the scope of this
    document.   ISO/IEC 23290:2004 is applicable to PINXs that can be interconnected
    to form a PISN using QSIG as the inter-PINX signalling protocol.
