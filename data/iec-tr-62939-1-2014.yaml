  content: "IEC TR 62939-1:2014(E) presents an international consensus perspective
    on the vision for a Smart Grid User Interface (SGUI) including:<br />\r\n- SGUI
    requirements distilled from use cases for communications across the customer interface
    (the SGUI);<br />\r\n- an analysis of existing IEC and other international standards
    that relate to the SGUI;<br />\r\n- and an identification of standards gaps that
    need to be filled and might become potential work items in IEC. The committee's
    scope is, \"Standardization in the field of information exchange for demand response
    and in connecting demand side equipment and/or systems into the Smart Grid\".
    This report presents the information exchange and interface requirements leading
    to standards to support effective integration of consumer systems and devices
    into the Smart Grid."
