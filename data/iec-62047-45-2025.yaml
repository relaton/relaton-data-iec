  content: "IEC 62047-45:2025 specifies the requirements and testing method to measure
    the impact resistance of nanostructures which are fabricated by micromachining
    technology used in silicon-based micro-electromechanical system (MEMS).<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to the in-situ impact resistance measurement of nanostructures
    manufactured by microelectronic technology process and other micromachining technology.<br
    />\r\nIn the production of MEMS devices, due to the micro/nano size, the non-ideal
    effect of fabrication is greatly amplified compared with the macroscale. Surface
    defects, line width loss, and residual stress can occur in the fabricated object,
    resulting in severe fluctuations in the mechanical strength of MEMS devices. This
    document specifies an in-situ measurement method for the impact resistance of
    nanostructures based on MEMS technology to extract the impact strength of actual
    manufactured structures. This test method does not need intricated instruments
    (such as scanning probe microscopy and nanoindenter) and special test specimens.<br
    />\r\nSince the in-situ on-chip tester in this document can be implanted in device
    fabrication as a standard detection pattern, this document can provide a bridge,
    by which the fabrication part can give some quantitative reference for the design
    part."
