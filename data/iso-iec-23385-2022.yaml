  content: "<p>This document specifies a method for measuring single photo printing
    time of digital photo printing devices on a wide range of print technologies.
    This document is applicable to digital photo printing devices that can produce
    photo prints on either 2” × 3” (51 mm × 76 mm), L (89 mm × 127 mm), 4” × 6” (102
    mm × 152 mm), A6 (105 mm × 148 mm), A4 (210 mm × 297 mm), 8,5” × 11” (215,9 mm
    × 279,4 mm), 11” × 17” (279,4 mm × 431,8 mm), A3 (297 mm × 420 mm) or A3+ size
    sheets. Devices can be connected to either the computer system, media card or
    mobile devices. This document includes test setup procedure, test runtime procedure
    and reporting requirements for the digital single photo printing time measurements.
    Instant photoprint systems, which do not complete image formation at the time
    of paper ejection from device, are out of the scope of this document.</p>"
