    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60695-5-1:2021
    provides guidance on the following:<br />\r\na) general aspects of corrosion damage
    test methods;<br />\r\nb) methods of measurement of corrosion damage;<br />\r\nc)
    consideration of test methods;<br />\r\nd) relevance of corrosion damage data
    to hazard assessment.<br />\r\nThis basic safety publication is primarily intended
    for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards in accordance
    with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. It is not
    intended for use by manufacturers or certification bodies. One of the responsibilities
    of a technical committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety
    publications in the preparation of its publications. The requirements, test methods
    or test conditions of this basic safety publication will not apply unless specifically
    referred to or included in the relevant publications. This standard is to be read
    in conjunction with IEC TS 60695-5-2.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition, published in 2002, and constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) References to IEC TS 60695-5-3 (withdrawn
    in 2014) have been removed.<br />\r\nb) References to IEC 60695-1-1 are now to
    its replacements: IEC 60695-1-10 and IEC 60695-1-11.<br />\r\nc) ISO/TR 9122-1
