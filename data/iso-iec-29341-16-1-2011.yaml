  content: 'ISO/IEC 29341-16-1:2011(E) defines an architecture that will address the
    issue of reporting and tracking power states of nodes in a network. The UPnP Low
    Power solution is designed to enable nodes in the network to report and track
    the Low Power states of other nodes in the network. Additionally, for nodes that
    support wake up capabilities, this architecture addresses methods to wake up those
    nodes when required. The objective of the UPnP Low Power solution is to allow
    UPnP devices to conserve energy and still be discoverable by UPnP Control Points.
    The UPnP Control Point will be aware of the UPnP devices and services implemented
    on a Low Power device even when the Low Power device is in a power savings mode.
    This architecture document defines two UPnP services that comprise the UPnP Low
    Power framework: Low Power device service and Basic Power Management Proxy service.'
