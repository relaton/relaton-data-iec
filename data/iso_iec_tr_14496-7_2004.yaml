abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 14496-7:2004 specifies the encoding tools that enhance both
    the execution and quality for the coding of visual objects as defined in ISO/IEC
    14496-2. There are five visual tools, including:\r\n\r\n\tFast Motion Estimation;\r\n\tFast
    Global Motion Estimation;\r\n\tFast and Robust Sprite Generation;\r\n\tOptimized
    Reference Software for Simple Profile with Fast Variable Length Decoder Technique;
    and\r\n\tError Resilience Tools with RVLC.<br /><br />\r\nThe platform specific
    optimization is not currently addressed. The error resilience tools are separately
    implemented based on the Momusys reference software."
