abstract:
- content: "IEC 61400-1:2019+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies essential design requirements
    to ensure the structural integrity of wind turbines. Its purpose is to provide
    an appropriate level of protection against damage from all hazards during the
    planned lifetime. This document is concerned with all subsystems of wind turbines
    such as control and protection functions, internal electrical systems, mechanical
    systems and support structures. This document applies to wind turbines of all
    sizes. For small wind turbines, IEC 61400-2 can be applied. IEC 61400-3-1 provides
    additional requirements to offshore wind turbine installations. This document
    is intended to be used together with the appropriate IEC and ISO standards mentioned
    in Clause 2. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) general update and clarification
    of references and requirements;<br />\r\nb) extension of wind turbine classes
    to allow for tropical cyclones and high turbulence;<br />\r\nc) Weibull distribution
    of turbulence standard deviation for normal turbulence model (NTM);<br />\r\nd)
    updated design load cases (DLCs), in particular DLC 2.1 and 2.2;<br />\r\ne) revision
    of partial safety factor specifications<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    1 (2019-09) and Interpretation sheet 1 (2025-02) have been included in this copy."
