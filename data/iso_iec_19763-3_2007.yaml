abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19763 specifies a metamodel framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC
    19763-3:2007 specifies the metamodel that is intended to promote interoperation
    among application systems based on ontologies.The metamodel specified by ISO/IEC
    19763-3:2007 provides a facility to register administrative information related
    to ontologies, which consist of several sentences that use several non-logical
    symbols, irrespective of the languages in which they are described. The metamodel
    also distinguishes a reference ontology, an ontology that is usable and sharable
    by a community of interest, and a local ontology, an ontology that is specialized
    for defined applications.The metamodel, together with repositories that contain
    actual ontologies, makes it possible for users to gain the benefits of interoperation
    among application systems based on ontologies.
