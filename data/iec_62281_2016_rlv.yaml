abstract:
- content: "IEC 62281:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 62281:2016 specifies
    test methods and requirements for primary and secondary (rechargeable) lithium
    cells and batteries to ensure their safety during transport other than for recycling
    or disposal. Requirements specified in this standard do not apply in those cases
    where special provisions given in the relevant regulations, listed in 7.3, provide
    exemptions.<br />\r\nNOTE - Different standards may apply for lithium-ion traction
    battery systems used for electrically propelled road vehicles.<br />\r\nThis third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2012, and constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Deletion of the wire
    mesh screen from the evaluation of test criteria for an explosion;<br />\r\n-
    Extension / modification of the shock test parameters so as to achieve constant
    energy behaviour for large batteries as well as explanations in a new Annex A;<br
    />\r\n- Modification of the external short-circuit method so as to allow the short-circuit
    to be applied to large batteries after they have been removed from the temperature
    chamber;<br />\r\n- Change of the cell diameter distinguishing between impact
    and crush test from 20 mm to 18 mm;<br />\r\n- Addition of possible content for
    a transport certificate.</p>"
