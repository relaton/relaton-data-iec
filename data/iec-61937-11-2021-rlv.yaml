  content: "IEC 61937-11:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and

    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61937-11:2021
    describes the method to convey non-linear PCM bitstreams encoded in accordance
    with the MPEG-4 AAC format and its extensions (spectral band replication, parametric
    stereo and MPEG surround), and non-linear PCM bitstreams encoded in accordance
    with the MPEG-D USAC format, framed in MPEG-4 LATM/LOAS. IEC 61937-11:2021 cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2010, and Amendment 1:2018. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    MPEG-D USAC has been added."
