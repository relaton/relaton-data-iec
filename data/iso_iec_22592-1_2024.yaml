abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 22592-1:2024 This document specifies test methods as well as test
    charts to measure the image quality attributes and those variations in colour
    prints typically used in office environment. Included are digital colour prints
    formed by using a multifunction or single function printer. Printers supporting
    a maximum paper size of A4 or larger are suitable for the measurements using the
    test charts defined in this document.<br />\r\nThe image quality attributes included
    are colour reproduction, line quality, graininess and mottle.<br />\r\nThe sources
    of variation considered are locations in a page (within-page variation), printed
    side in a sheet (side-to-side variation), printed order of the sheet (sheet-to-sheet
    variation) and colours printed on the back side of evaluated patch (show-through
    variation).<br />\r\nA duplex print set, comprising several sheets which are printed
    by multifunction or single function printer with colour images on both surfaces
    of a substrate, is a main application of the test methods to measure image quality
    variations in the set. Variations, such as within-page variation and sheet-to-sheet
    variation, are also applicable for a simplex print set comprising several sheets
    which are printed colour images on one surface of a substrate and no image on
    the other surface.<br />\r\nBoth duplex and simplex printers are applicable to
    form a print set. When image qualities of duplex prints are measured, duplex printers
    which are capable to print images on both sides of substrate automatically are
    applicable to form duplex prints. However, simplex printers which require a manual
    arrangement of substrates between the front side and back side printing to form
    duplex prints are out of scope of this document."
