abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 26551:2016, within the context of tools and methods of requirements
    engineering for software and systems product lines<strong>:</strong></p><p>- provides
    the terms and definitions specific to requirements engineering for software and
    systems product lines and associated member products;</p><p>- defines process
    groups and their processes performed during product line requirements engineering
    (those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes);</p><p>-
    defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;</p><p>-
    defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    26551:2016 concerns processes and capabilities of requirements tools and methods
    for a family of products, not for a single system.</p><p>This International Standard
    is not applicable to physical artefacts. Instead, system-level artefacts and software
    lifecycle artefacts such as requirements documents, architectural data, validation
    plans, behavioural models, etc. are produced using methods and tools in this International
    Standard. In the case of the software components of a system, this International
    Standard can apply twice: once to handle the system elements of the product line
    and a second time to handle the software elements of the product line, if any.
    The product line processes are recursive within the different levels of products.</p><p>NOTE
    The requirements in this International Standard apply to the family of systems,
    software or services.</p>"
