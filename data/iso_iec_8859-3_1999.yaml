abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 184</p><p>coded graphic
    characters identified as Latin</p><p>alphabet No. 3.</p><p>This set of coded graphic
    characters is intended for</p><p>use in data and text processing applications
    and</p><p>also for information interchange.</p><p>The set contains graphic characters
    used for</p><p>general purpose applications in typical office</p><p>environments
    in at least the following languages:</p><p>Esperanto and Maltese, and if needed
    in conjunction</p><p>with these, English, French (with restrictions,</p><p>see
    Annex A.1, Notes), German, Italian, Latin and</p><p>Portuguese. Coding of Turkish
    characters using this</p><p>part is deprecated, that specified in part 9 is to
    be</p><p>used.</p><p>This set of coded graphic characters may be</p><p>regarded
    as a version of an 8-bit code according to</p><p>ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873
    at level 1.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in</p><p>conjunction
    with any other parts of ISO/IEC 8859.</p><p>If coded characters from more than
    one part are to</p><p>be used together, by means of code extension</p><p>techniques,
    the equivalent coded character sets</p><p>from ISO/IEC 10367 should be used instead
    within</p><p>a version of ISO/IEC 4873 at level 2 or level 3.</p><p>The coded
    characters in this set may be used in</p><p>conjunction with coded control functions
    selected</p><p>from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions are</p><p>not used
    to create composite graphic symbols from</p><p>two or more graphic characters
    (see clause 6).</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>? ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for
    use with</p><p>Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information coded</p><p>according
    to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such</p><p>services, it will have to conform
    to the requirements of</p><p>those services at the access-point.</p>"
