abstract:
- content: This test is intended to determine the suitability of component parts for
    use in electronic equipment which may be subjected to moderately severe shocks
    as a result of suddenly applied forces or abrupt changes in motion produced by
    rough handling, transportation, or field operation. It is normally applicable
    to cavity-type packages.
