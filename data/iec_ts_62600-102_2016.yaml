abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62600-102:2016(E) describes the required methods and the required
    conditions to determine the power performance of the Wave Energy Converter 2 (WEC
    2) in Location 2, possibly at a different scale and with configuration changes
    to accommodate the new site conditions, in all cases based on measured power performance
    of WEC 1 in Location 1. This technical specification allows for assessment at
    Location 1 or Location 2 based on limited/incomplete data material, as long as
    this is accompanied by a validated numerical model or physical model and assessment
    of the uncertainty involved. Another key element is transparency in the assessment.
