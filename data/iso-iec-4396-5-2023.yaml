  content: <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document defines the procedure
    executed by a Member of a distributed inter-process communication (IPC) facility
    (DIF) or distributed application facility (DAF) to initialize a new Member as
    a fully functioning Member. This document defines the procedure for a new Member
    to enrol when the new Member was recently a Member of the DIF or DAF. This document
    is defined for use with DIFs, but it can be used equally well by a DAF that wants
    to assign synonyms with a scope limited to the DAF.</span></p>
