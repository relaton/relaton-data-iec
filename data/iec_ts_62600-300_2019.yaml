abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-300:2019 provides:<br />\r\n· A systematic methodology for
    evaluating the power performance of river current energy converters (RECs) that
    produce electricity for utility scale and localized grids;<br />\r\n· A definition
    of river energy converter rated capacity and rated water speed;<br />\r\n· A methodology
    for the production of power curves for the river energy converters in consideration;
    and<br />\r\n· A framework for the reporting of results.<br />\r\nExclusions from
    the scope of this document are as follows:<br />\r\n· RECs that provide forms
    of energy other than electrical energy unless the other form is an intermediary
    step that is converted into electricity by the river energy converter;<br />\r\n·
    Resource assessment, that will be addressed separately in the River Energy Resource
    Assessment Technical Specification;<br />\r\n· Scaling of any measured or derived
    results;<br />\r\n· Power quality issues;<br />\r\n· Any type of performance other
    than power and energy performance; and<br />\r\n· The combined effect of multiple
    river energy converter arrays."
