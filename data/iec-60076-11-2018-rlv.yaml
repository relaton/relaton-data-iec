  content: "IEC 60076-11:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60076-11:2018
    applies to dry-type power transformers (including auto-transformers) having values
    of highest voltage for equipment up to and including 72,5 kV and at least one
    winding operating at greater than 1,1 kV. This document does not apply to:<br
    />\r\n- gas-filled dry-type transformers where the gas is not air;<br />\r\n-
    single-phase transformers rated at less than 5 kVA;<br />\r\n- polyphase transformers
    rated at less than 15 kVA;<br />\r\n- instrument transformers;<br />\r\n- starting
    transformers;<br />\r\n- testing transformers;<br />\r\n- traction transformers
    mounted on rolling stock;<br />\r\n- flameproof and mining transformers;<br />\r\n-
    welding transformers;<br />\r\n- voltage regulating transformers;<br />\r\n- small
    power transformers in which safety is a special consideration.<br />\r\nWhere
    IEC standards do not exist for the transformers mentioned above or for other special
    transformers, this document may be applicable as a whole or in parts. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2004 and constitutes
    a technical revision. The main changes with regard to the previous edition are
    as follows:<br />\r\n- Extension of the scope up to 72,5kV<br />\r\n- Enclosure
    management in regards of the performance<br />\r\n- Management of the dielectric
    and thermal features with altitude<br />\r\n- New climatic classes for a better
    adaptation of customers’ need<br />\r\n- Establishment of the relation between
    location and environmental classes<br />\r\n- For fire behaviour classes, limitation
    at 1000kVA and process of test more robust<br />\r\n- Introduction of Seismic
    class<br />\r\n- Recommendations for amorphous transformers<br />\r\nKeywords:
    dry-type transformers<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of March 2019 and
    the Interpretation sheet 1 of July 2020 have been included in this copy."
