  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-13:2020 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic<br />\r\n• oxygen functional group content
    on graphite oxide, graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and other types of functionalized
    graphene by<br />\r\n• Boehm titration method.<br />\r\nIn this document, the
    measured functional groups are carboxyl groups (also in the form of their cyclic
    anhydrides), lactone groups, hydroxyl groups and reactive carbonyl groups. Oxygen
    functional groups that exhibit no reactivity such as epoxides cannot be measured<br
