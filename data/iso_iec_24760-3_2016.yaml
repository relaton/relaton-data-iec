abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24760-3:2016 provides guidance for the management of identity information
    and for ensuring that an identity management system conforms to ISO/IEC 24760-1
    and ISO/IEC 24760-2.<p>ISO/IEC 24760-3:2016 is applicable to an identity management
    system where identifiers or PII relating to entities are acquired, processed,
    stored, transferred or used for the purposes of identifying or authenticating
    entities and/or for the purpose of decision making using attributes of entities.
    Practices for identity management can also be addressed in other standards.</p>
