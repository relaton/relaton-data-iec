    <p>ISO/IEC 18000 defines the air interfaces for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices used in item management applications. ISO/IEC 18000-6 defines the air interface for these devices operating at frequencies from 860 MHz to 960 MHz.</p>
    <p>The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 18047 is to provide test methods for conformance with the various parts of ISO/IEC 18000.</p>
    <p>Each part of ISO/IEC TR 18047 contains all measurements required to be made on a product in order to establish whether it conforms to the corresponding part of ISO/IEC 18000. For ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006, each interrogator needs to be assessed for operation with both types A and B, while each tag is only required to support at least one of the types A or B.</p>
    <p>It should be noted that measurement of tag and interrogator performance is covered by ISO/IEC TR 18046.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-6, but does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p>
    <p>The test methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented, be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general case.</p>
    <p>The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 are the following:</p>
    <ul><li>type-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;</li><li>parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</li></ul>
    <p>The following are not included in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006:</p>
    <ul><li>parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;</li><li>high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962). </li></ul>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 are to be applied exclusively to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-6.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 also describes all necessary conformance tests.</p>
