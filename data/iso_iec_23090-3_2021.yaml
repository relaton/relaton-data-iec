abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a video coding technology known as versatile
    video coding (VVC), comprising a video coding technology with a compression capability
    that is substantially beyond that of the prior generations of such standards and
    with sufficient versatility for effective use in a broad range of applications.</p><p>Only
    the syntax format, semantics, and associated decoding process requirements are
    specified, while other matters such as pre-processing, the encoding process, system
    signalling and multiplexing, data loss recovery, post-processing, and video display
    are considered to be outside the scope of this document. Additionally, the internal
    processing steps performed within a decoder are also considered to be outside
    the scope of this document; only the externally observable output behaviour is
    required to conform to the specifications of this document.</p><p>This document
    is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide range of applications,
    bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services. Applications include, but are
    not limited to, video coding for digital storage media, television broadcasting
    and real-time communication. In the course of creating This document, various
    requirements from typical applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic
    elements have been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax.
    Hence, this document is designed to facilitate video data interchange among different
    applications.</p>"
