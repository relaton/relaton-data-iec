    <p>ISO/IEC 15944-2:2015 specifies procedures to be followed in establishing, maintaining, and publishing registers of unique, unambiguous and permanent identifiers and meanings that are assigned to Open-edi scenarios and scenario components. In order to accomplish this purpose, ISO/IEC 15944-2:2015 specifies elements of information that are necessary to provide identification and meaning to the registered items and to manage the registration of these items.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15944-2:2015 defines the procedures to be applied by qualified JTC1 Registration Authority(ies) appointed by the ISO and IEC council to maintain a register(s) of Open-edi scenarios and/or scenario components for the purpose of their reusability.</p>
