    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62626-1:2023
    applies to enclosed switches-disconnectors with rated voltages up to 1 000 V AC
    for repair and maintenance work or cleaning work in load circuits. Devices within
    the scope of this document are switch-disconnectors in accordance with IEC 60947-3
    with specific additional requirements. Enclosed switch-disconnectors in this document
    are suitable for isolation in accordance with the IEC 60947 series and are not
    equipped with means for remote control or automatic switching to avoid unexpected
    or accidental start. These devices are not used for operational switching, for
    example quick start and stop, jogging. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
