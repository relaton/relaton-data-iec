    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61935-2:2021 specifies
    test methods for balanced and coaxial cords, which are used as equipment cords,
    patch cords, and CP cords, within cabling systems, in accordance with ISO/IEC
    11801-1. The test methods and associated requirements are provided to demonstrate
    performance and reliability and to ensure compatibility of these balanced and
    coaxial cords during their operational lifetime. This document may also be used
    for providing test methodology for assessing the performance of other cords.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2010. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- inclusion of cords up to category 8.1 and
