  content: "IEC 60060-1:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60060-1:2025
    is applicable to:<br />\r\n- dielectric tests with direct voltage;<br />\r\n-
    dielectric tests with alternating voltage;<br />\r\n- dielectric tests with impulse
    voltage;<br />\r\n- dielectric tests with combinations of the above.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to tests on equipment having its highest voltage for equipment
    Um above 1,0 kV AC and 1,5 kV DC.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The general layout and text have been updated
    and improved to make the standard easier to use, particularly the clauses for
    combined and composite test voltages.<br />\r\n- The positive tolerance of the
    front time of lightning impulse voltage has been extended for Um > 800 kV to 100
    % (= 2,4 µs).<br />\r\n- For switching impulse voltage, a front time has been
    introduced, similar to lightning impulse voltage and with the new front time the
    standard switching impulse is defined as 170/2 500 µs.<br />\r\n- The requirements
    for precipitations have been adjusted depending on Um.<br />\r\n- A new Annex
    C, \"Procedure for manual calculation from graphical waveforms\" has been incorporated.<br
    />\r\n- No examples of software have been given in Annex D, \"Guidance for implementing
    software for evaluation of lightning impulse voltage parameters\".<br />\r\n-
    The annex relating to the \"Background to the introduction of the test voltage
    factor for evaluation of impulses with overshoot\" has been deleted.<br />\r\n-
    A new informative Annex F, \"New definition of the front time of switching impulse
    voltage\" has been incorporated.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Alternative test procedures can
    be required to obtain reproducible and significant results. The choice of a suitable
    test procedure is considered by the relevant Technical Committee.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 For voltages Um above 800 kV it is possible that some specified procedures,
    tolerances and uncertainties will not be achievable."
