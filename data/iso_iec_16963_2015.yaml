abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 16963:2015 specifies an accelerated aging test method for estimating
    the lifetime of the retrievability of information stored on recordable or rewritable
    optical disks.</p><p>The method is based on the theoretical assumption that the
    lifetime of data recorded on an optical disk has a lognormal distribution.</p><p>Detailed
    testing is specified for the following formats: DVD-R/RW/RAM disks, +R/+RW disks,
    CD-R/RW disks and BD recordable / rewritable disks. The testing can be applied
    to additional optical-disk formats with substitution of the appropriate specifications
    and can also be updated by committee in the future as required.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    16963:2015 includes: stress conditions (Basic and Rigorous stress-conditions for
    testing and subsequent analysis using both the Eyring and Arrhenius methods);
    ambient storage conditions in which the lifetime of data stored on optical disk
    is estimated (a Controlled storage-condition, 25 °C and 50 % RH, representing
    full-time air conditioning - the Eyring method is used to estimate the lifetime
    under this storage condition; and a Harsh storage-condition, 30 °C and 80 % RH,
    representing the most severe conditions in which users handle and store optical
    disks - the Arrhenius method is used to estimate the lifetime under this storage
    condition); a description of the evaluation system; procedures for specimen preparation
    and data acquisition; definitions and methods used in testing specific disk types;
    analysis of test results to determine the lifetime of stored data; and a format
    for reporting the estimated lifetime of stored data.</p><p>The methodology includes
    only the effects of temperature and relative humidity. It does not attempt to
    model degradation due to complex failure mechanism kinetics, nor does it test
    for exposure to light, corrosive gases, contaminants, handling, or variations
    in playback subsystems. Disks exposed to these additional sources of stress or
    higher levels of temperature and relative humidity are expected to experience
    shorter usable lifetimes.</p>"
