abstract:
- content: "<p>This document:</p><p>a) describes the general principles for data centres
    upon which the requirements of the ISO/IEC22237 series are based;</p><p>b) defines
    the common aspects of data centres including terminology, parameters and reference
    models (functional elements and their accommodation) addressing both the size
    and complexity of their intended purpose;</p><p>c) describes general aspects of
    the facilities and infrastructures required to support data centres;</p><p>d)
    specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of “availability”,
    “security” and “energy-efficiency” over the planned lifetime of the data centre,
    for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;</p><p>e) details
    the issues to be addressed in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling
    application of the classification of the data centre;</p><p>f) provides a reference
    to the operation and management of data centres.</p><p>The following topics are
    outside of the scope of the ISO/IEC 22237 series:</p><p>1) the selection of information
    technology and network telecommunications equipment, software and associated configuration
    issues are outside the scope of this International Standard;</p><p>2) quantitative
    analysis of overall service availability resulting from multi-site data centres;</p><p>3)
    safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements (covered by other
    standards and regulations. However, information given in this document can be
    of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations).</p>"
