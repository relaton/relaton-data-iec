abstract:
- content: "This document:<br />\r\na) describes the general principles for data centres
    upon which the requirements of the ISO/IEC22237 series are based;<br />\r\nb)
    defines the common aspects of data centres including terminology, parameters and
    reference models (functional elements and their accommodation) addressing both
    the size and complexity of their intended purpose;<br />\r\nc) describes general
    aspects of the facilities and infrastructures required to support data centres;<br
    />\r\nd) specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of “availability”,
    “security” and “energy-efficiency” over the planned lifetime of the data centre,
    for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;<br />\r\ne) details
    the issues to be addressed in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling
    application of the classification of the data centre;<br />\r\nf) provides a reference
    to the operation and management of data centres.<br />\r\nThe following topics
    are outside of the scope of the ISO/IEC 22237 series:<br />\r\n1) the selection
    of information technology and network telecommunications equipment, software and
    associated configuration issues are outside the scope of this International Standard;<br
    />\r\n2) quantitative analysis of overall service availability resulting from
    multi-site data centres;<br />\r\n3) safety and electromagnetic compatibility
    (EMC) requirements (covered by other standards and regulations. However, information
    given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations)."
