    Provides a distinctive symbol and labels to be used to identify those devices that require special packing and handling precautions.
    Certain plastic surface-mount components are subject to permanent damage due to moisture-induced failures encountered during high-temperature surface-mount processing unless appropriate precautions are observed. IEC/PAS 62168 is in the process of being re-issued in the form of IEC international standard under reference IEC 60749-20-1.
