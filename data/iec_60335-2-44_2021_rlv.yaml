abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-44:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-44:2021
    deals with the safety of electric ironers for both commercial and household and
    similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    appliances and 480 V for other appliances. Appliances not intended for normal
    household, but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such
    as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on
    farms, are within the scope of this standard. Examples of appliances within the
    scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n– ironing presses for one-person operation;<br
    />\r\n– mangles;<br />\r\n– rotary ironers for one-person operation;<br />\r\n–
    trouser presses.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the
    common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in
    and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n–
    persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities or
    lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to:<br />\r\n– rotary ironers for operation by more than one person. The
    roller length of such appliances normally exceeds 1,6 m in length;<br />\r\n–
    appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n–
    electric irons (IEC 60335-2-3);<br />\r\n– battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2002, Amendment
    1:2008 and Amendment 2:2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text (1, 20.1, 22.103);<br
    />\r\nc) exclusion of battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) introduction
    of accessible surface temperature limits (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is
    to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
