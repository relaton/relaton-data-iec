abstract:
- content: This document specifies protocols, procedures, and managed objects used
    to ensure that the synchronization requirements are met for time-sensitive applications,
    such as audio, video, and time-sensitive control, across networks, for example,
    IEEE 802 and similar media. This includes the maintenance of synchronized time
    during normal operation and following addition, removal, or failure of network
    components and network reconfiguration. It specifies the use of IEEE 1588™ specifications
    where applicable in the context of IEEE Std 802.1Q™-2018.1 Synchronization to
    an externally provided timing signal [e.g., a recognized timing standard such
    as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) or International Atomic Time (TAI)] is not
    part of this standard but is not precluded.
