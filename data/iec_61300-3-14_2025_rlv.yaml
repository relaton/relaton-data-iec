abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-3-14:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-14:2025
    provides a method to measure the error and repeatability of the attenuation value
    settings of a variable optical attenuator (VOA). There are two control technologies
    for VOAs: manually controlled and electrically controlled. This document covers
    both VOA control technologies and also both single-mode fibres and multimode fibres
    VOAs. For electrically controlled VOAs, the hysteresis characteristics of attenuation
    are sometimes important. The hysteresis characteristics can be measured as stated
    in Annex B. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2014.<br />\r\nThis edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) addition of IEC 61315, Calibration of fibre-optic power meters
    as normative reference;<br />\r\nb) addition of Clause 3 containing terms, definitions
    and abbreviated terms;<br />\r\nc) addition of notes for permission of repeatability
    definition with 2σ;<br />\r\nd) correction of error in Figure 1 a) and Figure
    1 b);<br />\r\ne) addition of a clear statement on EF launch condition requirement
    for MM source;<br />\r\nf) change of “Detector” to “Power meter”;<br />\r\ng)
    combination of Clause 7 and Clause 8 into a new Clause 8 titled “Details to be
    specified and reported”;<br />\r\nh) addition of uncertainty considerations in
    Clause 7;<br />\r\ni) correction of error in Formula (B.3)."
