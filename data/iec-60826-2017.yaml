  content: "IEC 60826:2017 specifies the loading and strength requirements of overhead
    lines derived from reliability-based design principles. These requirements apply
    to lines 45 kV and above, but can also be applied to lines with a lower nominal
    voltage.<br />\r\nThis document also provides a framework for the preparation
    of national standards dealing with overhead transmission lines, using reliability
    concepts and employing probabilistic or semi-probabilistic methods. These national
    standards will need to establish the local climatic data for the use and application
    of this standard, in addition to other data that are country- specific.<br />\r\nAlthough
    the design criteria in this standard apply to new lines, many concepts can be
    used to address the design and reliability requirements for refurbishment, upgrading
    and uprating of existing lines.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover the detailed
    design of line components such as supports, foundations, conductors or insulators
    strings.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2003. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThe main technical changes
    with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\nThis standard has
    been further simplified by removing many informative annexes and theoretical details
    that can now be found in CIGRE Technical Brochure 178 and referred to as needed
    in the text of the standard. Many revisions have also been made that reflect the
    users experience in the application of this standard, together with information
    about amplification of wind speed due to escarpments. The annexes dealing with
    icing data have also been updated using new work by CIGRE.<br />\r\nKey words:
    Overhead lines, Overhead transmission lines, reliability, energy"
