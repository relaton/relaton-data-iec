  content: "IEC 61280-1-3:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61280-1-3:2021
    provides definitions and measurement procedures for several wavelength and spectral
    width properties of an optical spectrum associated with a fibre optic communication
    subsystem, an optical transmitter, or other light sources used in the operation
    or test of communication subsystems. This document also provides definitions and
    measurement procedures for side-mode suppression ratio and signal-to-source spontaneous
    emission ratio. The measurement is done for the purpose of system construction
    and/or maintenance. In the case of communication subsystem signals, the optical
    transmitter is typically under modulation. NOTE Different properties can be appropriate
    to different spectral types, such as continuous spectra characteristics of light-emitting
    diodes (LEDs), as well as multilongitudinal-mode (MLM), multitransverse-mode (MTM)
    and single-longitudinal mode (SLM) spectra, which are characteristic of laser
    diodes (LDs). This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- addition of measurement of signal-to-source spontaneous emission ratio
    in 8.9;<br />\r\n- change of document title to reflect the additional measurement;<br
    />\r\n- additional information on the resolution bandwidth used in the measurement
    of the side-mode suppression ratio in 8.8;<br />\r\n- use of a calibrated optical
    wavelength meter for accurate wavelength measurements of single-longitudinal mode
    lasers."
