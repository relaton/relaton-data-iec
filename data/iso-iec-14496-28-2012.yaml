  content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 14496 specifies the Composite Font Representation,
    an XML-based document format that allows combining individual component font resources
    into a single virtual font. Recent advances in developing the Unicode Standard
    and the addition of new characters that represent most of the world's languages
    and writing systems have resulted in a significant increase of the Unicode character
    repertoire, and this process is likely to continue in the future. Therefore, the
    ability to combine a number of individual fonts supporting different languages
    and Unicode ranges in a single virtual font description provides the opportunity
    for various users and creators of multimedia, graphics and textual content to
    support all of the world's languages and utilize the existing font rendering solutions
    that are implemented in current computing platforms and deployed in many existing
    devices.</p>"
