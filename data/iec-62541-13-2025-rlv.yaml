  content: "IEC 62541-13:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62541-13:2025
    defines the information model associated with Aggregates. Programmatically produced
    aggregate examples are listed in Annex A. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Multiple fixes for the computation of aggregates<br
    />\r\n• The Raw status bit is always set for non-bad StatusCodes for the Start
    and End aggregates.<br />\r\n• Entries in the Interpolative examples Tables A2.2
    Historian1, Historian2, and Historian3 have been changed from Good to Good, Raw
    status codes when the timestamp matches with the timestamp of the data source.<br
    />\r\n• Missing tables have been added for DurationInStateZero and DurationInStateNonZero.<br
    />\r\n• The value of zero has been removed for results with a StatusCode of bad.<br
    />\r\n• Data Type was listed as \"Status Code\" when it is \"Double\" for both
    Standard Deviation and both Variance Aggregates.<br />\r\n• Rounding Error in
    TimeAverage and TimeAverage2 have been corrected.<br />\r\n• The status codes
    have been corrected for the last two intervals and the value has been corrected
    in the last interval.<br />\r\n• The wording has been changed to be more consistent
    with the certification testing tool.<br />\r\n• UsedSlopedExtrapolation set to
    true for Historian2 and all examples locations needed new values or status' are
    modified.<br />\r\n• Values affected by percent good and percent bad have been
    updated.<br />\r\n• PercentGood/PercentBad are now accounted for in the calculation.<br
    />\r\n• TimeAverage uses SlopedInterpolation but the Time aggregate is incorrectly
    allowed to used Stepped Interpolation.<br />\r\n• Partial bit is now correctly
    calculated.<br />\r\n• Unclear sentence was removed.<br />\r\n• Examples have
    been moved to a CSV.<br />\r\n• The value and status code for Historian 3 have
    been updated.<br />\r\n• TimeAverage2 Historian1 now takes uncertain regions into
    account when calculating StatusCodes.<br />\r\n• TimeAverage2 Historian2 now takes
    uncertain regions into account when calculating StatusCodes.<br />\r\n• Total2
    Historian1 now takes uncertain regions into account when calculating StatusCodes<br
    />\r\n• Total2 Historian2 now takes uncertain regions into account when calculating
    StatusCodes<br />\r\n• Maximum2 Historian1 now takes uncertain regions into account
    when calculating StatusCodes<br />\r\n• MaximumActualTime2 Historian1 now takes
    uncertain regions into account when calculating StatusCodes<br />\r\n• Minimum2
    Historian1 now takes uncertain regions into account when calculating StatusCodes<br
    />\r\n• MinimumActualTime2 Historian1 now has the StatusCodes calculated while
    using the TreatUncertainAsBad flag.<br />\r\n• Range2 Historian1 now looks at
    TreatUncertainAsBad in the calculation of the StatusCodes.<br />\r\n• Clarifications
    have been made to the text defining how PercentGood/PercentBad are used. The table
    values and StatusCodes of the TimeAverage2 and Total2 aggregates have been corrected."
