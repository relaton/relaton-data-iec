  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-17:2023 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristic order parameter for graphene-based material and
    layered carbon material by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy.<br
    />\r\nThe order parameter is analysed from two perspectives: z-axis and x-y-axis.
    In the z-axis the order parameter is derived from the full width at half maximum
    (FWHM) of peak (002) in the XRD spectrum. In the x-y-axis, it is derived from
    the FWHM of peak (100) corresponding to diffraction patterns obtained by SAED
    (selected area electron diffraction) technique, which is routinely performed on
    most transmission electron microscopes in the world.<br />\r\nThe method is applicable
    for graphene-based material and layered carbon material including graphite, expanded
    graphite, amorphous carbon, vitreous carbon or glassy carbon, the structures of
    which are clarified by other characterization techniques.<br />\r\nThe method
    is applicable for differentiating few-layer graphene or reduced graphene oxide
    from layered carbon material.<br />\r\nTypical application area is quality control
    in manufacturing to ensure batch-to-batch reproducibility.<br />\r\nNOTE Graphene
    oxide, one type of graphene-based material, is not within the scope of this document."
