    (CASE) tools represent a major part of the supporting technologies used to develop
    and maintain information technology systems. Their selection must be carried out
    with careful consideration of both the technical and management requirements.ISO/IEC
    14102:2008 defines both a set of processes and a structured set of CASE tool characteristics
    for use in the technical evaluation and the ultimate selection of a CASE tool.
    It follows the software product evaluation model defined in ISO/IEC 14598-5:1998.ISO/IEC
    14102:2008 adopts the general model of software product quality characteristics
    and subcharacteristics defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1:2001 and extends these when the
    software product is a CASE tool; it provides product characteristics unique to
    CASE tools. This larger set of characteristics is then organized into four groups:characteristics
    related to life cycle process functionality; characteristics related to CASE tool
    usage functionality; general quality characteristics;general characteristics not
    related to quality. This grouping provides a more manageable approach to the overall
    evaluation and selection process.The technical evaluation can indicate how well
    a CASE tool meets its user's stated requirements. It can also indicate how well
    the tool meets its claimed functionality.The objective of the technical evaluation
    process is to provide quantitative results on which the final selection can be
    based. Measurement assigns numbers (or other ratings) to attributes of entities;
    a major activity of evaluation is to obtain these measurements for use in selection.
    The final selection results should aim to achieve objectivity, repeatability and
    impartiality. These objectives and the confidence in the outcomes will in part
    depend on the resources allocated to the overall evaluation and selection process.
    The user of ISO/IEC 14102:2008 is asked to deal with these issues at an early
    stage.To be widely acceptable, these CASE tool evaluation and selection processes
    must be of value to the users of CASE tools, and to the suppliers of CASE to the
    community at large. The information outlined in ISO/IEC 14102:2008 should lead
    to more cost effective selections of CASE tools and to a greater uniformity in
    how CASE tool functions and features are described.
