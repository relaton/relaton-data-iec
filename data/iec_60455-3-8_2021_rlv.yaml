abstract:
- content: "IEC 60455-3-8:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60455-3-8:2021
    gives the requirements for resins for power cable accessories that conform to
    this specification and meet established levels of performance. However, the selection
    of a material by a user for a specific application will be based on the actual
    requirements necessary for adequate performance in that application and not on
    this specification alone. These materials are designed to be used in low and medium
    voltage cable accessories and as such, electrical performance is proven as part
    of the assembly. Examples of this are described in EN 50393 and IEC 60502-4. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2013. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Clause 1: a link to assemblies according to IEC 60502-4 and EN 50393 was introduced;<br
    />\r\n- designation: the categories, especially the mechanical ones, were redefined;<br
    />\r\n- type tests: the testing was updated based on the chemical basis of the
    material;<br />\r\n- type tests: additional materials were introduced;<br />\r\n-
    Annex A: an examination grid was established."
