  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24792:2010 specifies a Multicast Session Management Protocol
    (MSMP), which is an application-layer control protocol for managing quality of
    service for group communication. The MSMP is designed to provide IP multicast-based
    multimedia applications with QoS management required for group multicasting such
    as QoS monitoring and reporting. The MSMP will operate over the conventional transport
    protocols and/or Enhanced Communications Transport Protocol (ECTP), and can be
    used as a control protocol together with the Group Management Protocol (GMP).
    Generally it is assumed that there is one MSMP server, one session creating client
    (or Session Creator), and one or more session participating clients (or Session
    Participants). MSMP consists of QoS management (QM) functions. QM can have five
    operations, e.g. QoS Report request and response, QoS Setting request and response,
    QoS Updating request and response, QoS Value request and response, and QoS Termination
    request and response. Detailed QoS setting mechanisms can be adopted if necessary.</p>"
