  content: "IEC 61300-2-11:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-11:2023
    is to ensure that the captivation or the attachment of the cable to the fibre
    optic devices or components, for example fibre optic closures, will withstand
    compressive axial loads likely to be applied during normal service. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added Terms
    and definitions clause;<br />\r\nb) removed severity table for closures;<br />\r\nc)
    added recommended severity for tubes and cables without strength member attachment."
