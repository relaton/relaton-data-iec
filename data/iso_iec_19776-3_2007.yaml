abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19775 (X3D) defines a system that integrates 3D graphics and multimedia.
    Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and
    aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms.
    ISO/IEC 19776-3:2007 defines a mapping of the abstract objects in X3D to a specific
    X3D encoding written out in a compact binary form.
