abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 17998:2012 describes a
    framework that provides context and definitions to enable organizations to understand
    and deploy service-oriented architecture (SOA) governance.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17998:2012
    defines:</p><ul><li>SOA Governance, including its relationship between Business,
    IT, and EA governance; this assists organizations in understanding the impact
    that the introduction of SOA into an organization has on governance;</li><li>an
    SOA Governance Reference Model (SGRM) and its constituent parts, which assists
    organizations in specifying their appropriate governance regimes; and capturing
    best practice as a basis for a common approach;</li><li>the SOA Governance Vitality
    Method (SGVM) which assists organizations in customizing the SGRM and realizing
    their SOA Governance Regimen.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 17998:2012 is not intended to
    be used as provided; it is intended to be customized to create appropriate SOA
    governance for the organization. Many of the lists are non-normative and exemplary
    and intended to be filtered and as input to the customization process.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    17998:2012 does not include an explanation of the fundamentals and value of SOA,
    which is important for being able to understand and apply SOA governance. It lists
    some of the many other specifications and books that are available on SOA basics.</p>
