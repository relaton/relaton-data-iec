  content: "IEC 60512-99-002:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60512-99-002:2021
    is used for the assessment of connectors within the scope of SC 48B that are used
    in twisted pair communication cabling with remote power, such as ISO/IEC 11801
    1 Class D, or better, balanced cabling in support of IEEE 802.3btTM (Power over
    Ethernet, supporting up to 90 W from the power sourcing equipment).<br />\r\nThe
    object of this document is to detail a test schedule to determine the ability
    of sets of connectors to withstand a minimum of 100 mechanical operations with
    electrical load, where an electrical current is being passed through the connectors
    in accordance with IEC 60512 9 3 during the separation (unmating) step. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2019. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: Test group UEL has been
    revised with respect to the order of the test phases, the test severities and
    the requirements."
