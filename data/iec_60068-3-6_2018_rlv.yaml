    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60068-3-6:2018
    provides a uniform and reproducible method of confirming that temperature and
    humidity test chambers, without specimens, conform to the requirements specified
    in climatic test procedures of IEC 60068-2 (all parts). This document is intended
    for users when conducting regular chamber performance monitoring. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2001. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Confirmation
