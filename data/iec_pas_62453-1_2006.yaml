abstract:
- content: includes the engineering and commissioning of field devices. Functionality
    for documentation and audit trail support is also considered. Examples and use
    cases are mainly given for actors, sensors and remote I/Os. Of course, FDT is
    prepared to be used for devices like drives, analyzers, recorders, etc. as well.
    The FDT interfaces are designed in such a way as to support all significant fieldbus
    protocols. The main focus of this version of FDT does not lie on any specific
    fieldbus protocol. Due to the scalable structure of FDT it will be easy to add
    new schemas in order to extend the scope to new protocols.
