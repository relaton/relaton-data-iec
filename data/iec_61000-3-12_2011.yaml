abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-3-12:2011 deals with the limitation of harmonic currents injected
    into the public supply system. The limits given in this International Standard
    are applicable to electrical and electronic equipment with a rated input current
    exceeding 16 A and up to and including 75 A per phase, intended to be connected
    to public low-voltage a.c. distribution systems of the following types:\r\n- nominal
    voltage up to 240 V, single-phase, two or three wires;\r\n- nominal voltage up
    to 690 V, three-phase, three or four wires;\r\n- nominal frequency 50 Hz or 60
    Hz. Other distribution systems are excluded. The limits given in this edition
    apply to equipment when connected to 230&#x2F;400 V, 50 Hz systems. This standard
    applies to equipment intended to be connected to low-voltage systems interfacing
    with the public supply at the low-voltage level. It does not apply to equipment
    intended to be connected only to private low-voltage systems interfacing with
    the public supply only at the medium- or high-voltage level. This standard defines:\r\na)
    requirements and emission limits for equipment;\r\nb) methods for type tests and
    simulations. Tests according to this International Standard are type tests of
    complete pieces of equipment. Conformity with this standard can also be determined
    by validated simulations. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2004 and constitutes a technical revision. The significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition are:\r\n- the replacement of the
    reference fundamental current I1 by the reference current Iref for the calculation
    of emission limits;\r\n- a new added table of current emission limits (Table 5);\r\n-
    a new added annex (Annex A) to define test conditions for some types of equipment;\r\n-
    Deletion of the former Annexes B (Approximate interpolation formulas) and D (Information
    on the PWHD factor)."
