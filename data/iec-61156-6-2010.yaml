  content: "IEC 61156-6:2010(E) referes to IEC 61156-1. The cables described herein
    are intended primarily for work area wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and ISO/IEC
    24702. It covers individually screened, common screened and unscreened pairs or
    quads. The transmission characteristics and the frequency range of the cables
    are specified at 20 °C. These cables can be used for various communication channels
    which use as many as four pairs simultaneously. In this sense, this sectional
    specification provides the cable characteristics required by system developers
    to evaluate new systems. It cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2007 and constitutes a technical revision. It includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- new requirements
    for new cables Cat6A, Cat7A;<br />\r\n- revised requirements and tests for the
    cables.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication shall be read in conjunction with
    <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/43466\">IEC 61156-1:2009</a>."
