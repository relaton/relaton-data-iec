abstract:
- content: Composite symbologies are a class of bar code symbology, the principal
    distinguishing feature of which is that they comprise two or more components,
    each of which is a distinct symbol, but which contain a set of related data. Typically
    one component is a linear symbol containing primary data, which may be read on
    its own in some areas of the application, and the other component(s) is a two-dimensional
    symbol containing supplementary data which qualifies the primary message, and
    requiring all components to be read to extract the complete message. The EAN.UCC
    Composite symbology, which is one such symbology. The use of the symbology is
    intended to comply with the GS1 General Specifications.An EAN.UCC Composite symbol
    consists of a linear component (encoding the item's primary identification) associated
    with an adjacent two-dimensional component (encoding supplementary data, such
    as a batch number or expiration date). The EAN.UCC Composite symbol always includes
    a linear component so that the primary identification is readable by all scanning
    technologies, and so that two-dimensional imagers can use the linear component
    as a finder pattern for the adjacent two-dimensional component. The EAN.UCC Composite
    symbol always includes a multi-row two-dimensional component, for compatibility
    with linear and two-dimensional imagers, and with linear and rastering laser scanners.EAN.UCC
    Composite symbols are intended for encoding identification numbers and data supplementary
    to the identification in accordance with GS1 General Specifications. The administration
    of the numbering system by EAN and UCC ensures that identification codes assigned
    to particular items are unique world-wide and that they and the associated supplementary
    data are defined in a consistent way.ISO/IEC 24723:2006 specifies the requirements
    for the EAN.UCC Composite symbology. It specifies the EAN.UCC Composite symbology
    characteristics; data character encodation, symbol formats, dimensions and print
    quality requirements, error correction rules, and reference decoding algorithms.
    For those linear and two-dimensional components of EAN.UCC Composite symbols with
    published symbology specifications, those published specifications apply, except
    as specifically noted in ISO/IEC 24723:2006.
