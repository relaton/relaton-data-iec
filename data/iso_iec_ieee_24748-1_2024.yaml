abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1:2024 This document provides guidance for the life
    cycle management of systems and software, complementing the processes described
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This document:<br />\r\n- addresses
    systems concepts and life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes, process application,
    key points of view, adaptation and use in various domains and by various disciplines;<br
    />\r\n- establishes a common framework for describing life cycles, including their
    individual stages, for the management of projects that provide or acquire either
    products or services;<br />\r\n- defines the concept of a life cycle;<br />\r\n-
    supports the use of the life cycle processes within an organization or a project;
    organizations and projects can use these life cycle concepts when acquiring and
    supplying either products or services;<br />\r\n- provides guidance on adapting
    a life cycle model and the content associated with a life cycle or a part of a
    life cycle;<br />\r\n- describes the relationship between life cycles and their
    use in applying the processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (systems aspects) and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 (software systems aspects);<br />\r\n- shows the relationships of life cycle
    concepts to the hardware, human, services, process, procedure, facility and naturally
    occurring entity aspects of projects;<br />\r\n- describes how its concepts relate
    to detailed process standards, for example, in the areas of measurement, project
    management, risk management and model-based systems and software engineering."
