abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides guidance for the life cycle
    management of systems and software, complementing the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This document:</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->addresses systems concepts
    and life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes, process application, key points
    of view, adaptation and use in various domains and by various disciplines;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->establishes
    a common framework for describing life cycles, including their individual stages,
    for the management of projects that provide or acquire either products or services;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->defines
    the concept of a life cycle;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1
    lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->supports the use of the life cycle
    processes within an organization or a project; organizations and projects can
    use these life cycle concepts when acquiring and supplying either products or
    services;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->provides
    guidance on adapting a life cycle model and the content associated with a life
    cycle or a part of a life cycle;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->describes the relationship
    between life cycles and their use in applying the processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288
    (systems aspects) and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 (software systems aspects);</p><p class="ListContinue1"
    style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->shows
    the relationships of life cycle concepts to the hardware, human, services, process,
    procedure, facility and naturally occurring entity aspects of projects;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->describes
    how its concepts relate to detailed process standards, for example, in the areas
    of measurement, project management, risk management and model-based systems and
    software engineering.</p>'
