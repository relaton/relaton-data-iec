    &lt;&#x2F;a&gt;from the ISO&#x2F;IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF)
    web site.\r\n\r\nThe RapidIO architecture was developed to address the need for
    a high-performance low pin count packet-switched system level interconnect to
    be used in a variety of applications as an open standard. The architecture is
    targeted toward networking, telecom, and high performance embedded applications.
    It is intended primarily as an intra-system interface, allowing chip-to-chip and
    board-to-board communications at Gigabyte per second performance levels. It provides
    a rich variety of features including high data bandwidth, low-latency capability
    and support for high-performance I&#x2F;O devices, as well as providing globally
    shared memory, message passing, and software managed programming models."
