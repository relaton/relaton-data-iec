abstract:
- content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />The electronic version of this International
    Standard can be downloaded from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force
    (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe RapidIO architecture was developed to address
    the need for a high-performance low pin count packet-switched system level interconnect
    to be used in a variety of applications as an open standard. The architecture
    is targeted toward networking, telecom, and high performance embedded applications.
    It is intended primarily as an intra-system interface, allowing chip-to-chip and
    board-to-board communications at Gigabyte per second performance levels. It provides
    a rich variety of features including high data bandwidth, low-latency capability
    and support for high-performance I/O devices, as well as providing globally shared
    memory, message passing, and software managed programming models."
