abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to</p><p>enable physical interchange of
    such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the recording</p><p>method and the recorded format called VXA-1, and
    thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such</p><p>magnetic
    tape cartridges.</p><p>This International Standard specifies three types depending
    on the length of magnetic tape contained in the case, referred to as</p><p>Type
    A, Type B and Type C.</p><p>Information interchange between systems also requires,
    at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the</p><p>interchange
    code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information
    on the interchanged cartridge.</p><p>If compression is used with this format,
    it shall be according to International Standard ISO/IEC 15200.</p>"
