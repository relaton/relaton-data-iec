abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of
    an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to<br />\r\nenable physical interchange of
    such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the recording<br />\r\nmethod and the recorded format called VXA-1, and
    thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape
    cartridges.<br />\r\nThis International Standard specifies three types depending
    on the length of magnetic tape contained in the case, referred to as<br />\r\nType
    A, Type B and Type C.<br />\r\nInformation interchange between systems also requires,
    at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange code(s)
    and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the
    interchanged cartridge.<br />\r\nIf compression is used with this format, it shall
    be according to International Standard ISO/IEC 15200."
