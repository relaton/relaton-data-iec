abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge
    to</p><p>enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also
    specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recording</p><p>method and
    the recorded format called VXA-1, and thereby allowing data interchange between
    drives by means of such</p><p>magnetic tape cartridges.</p><p>This International
    Standard specifies three types depending on the length of magnetic tape contained
    in the case, referred to as</p><p>Type A, Type B and Type C.</p><p>Information
    interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the
    interchange parties upon the</p><p>interchange code(s) and the specifications
    of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p><p>If
    compression is used with this format, it shall be according to International Standard
    ISO/IEC 15200.</p>
