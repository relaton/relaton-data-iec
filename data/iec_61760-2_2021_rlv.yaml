abstract:
- content: "IEC 61760-2:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61760-2:2021
    specifies the transportation and storage conditions for surface mounting devices
    (SMDs) that are fulfilled in order to enable trouble-free processing of surface
    mounting devices, both active and passive. (Conditions for printed boards are
    not taken into consideration.)<br />\r\nThe object of this document is to ensure
    that users of SMDs receive and store products that can be further processed (e.g.
    positioned, soldered) without prejudice to quality and reliability. Improper transportation
    and storage of SMDs can cause deterioration and result in assembly problems such
    as poor solderability, delamination and \"popcorning\". Cross-references for references
    from this edition 3 to the previous edition 2 of this document are listed in Annex
    X of this document."
