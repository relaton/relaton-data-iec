- content: "IEC 62841-2-16:2024+AMD1:2026 CSV is to be used in conjunction with IEC
    62841-1:2014. This document supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses
    in IEC 62841-1, so as to convert it into the IEC Standard: Particular requirements
    for hand-held fastener driving tools. Where a particular subclause of IEC 62841-1
    is not mentioned in this document, that subclause applies as far as reasonable.
    Where this document states \"addition\", \"modification\" or \"replacement\",
    the relevant text in IEC 62841-1 is to be adapted accordingly.<br />\r\nIEC 62841-1:2014,
    Clause 1 is applicable, except as follows:<br />\r\nAddition: This document applies
    to hand-held fastener driving tools<br />\r\n- intended for driving fasteners
    into or through concrete, fabric, fiberboard, metal, plastic, wood, wood products,
    cartons, and other materials; and<br />\r\n- whose energy to drive the fastener
    is derived directly or indirectly from an electric motor or magnetic drive.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to pneumatically driven tools where the compressed
    gas comes from an external source, such as a compressor or a tank.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to tools powered by combustible gases, even if electrically
    ignited.<br />\r\nNOTE 101 Tools powered by compressed air or combustible gases
    are covered by ISO 11148-13:2017."
