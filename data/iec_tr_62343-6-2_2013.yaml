abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62343-6-2:2013(E) clarifies dynamic module interfaces, which should
    be standardized, based on the surveys. Annex A is a summary of survey responses
    by region and Annex B provides survey results specific to the optical channel
    monitor (OCM). The object of this technical report is to propose a software and
    hardware interface standard of dynamic modules. The dynamic modules addressed
    are defined in the IEC 62343 series. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2009. It constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- the survey results of the software and hardware interface
    of OCM have been added as Annex B, which was presented at the IEC Seattle meeting
    in 2010. The results are in agreement with the general conclusion of the first
    edition;<br />\r\n- OPMON (optical performance monitor) in the body of the text
    has been changed to OCM (optical channel monitor) for consistency with the latest
    definitions. Keywords: software and hardware interface standard of dynamic modules"
