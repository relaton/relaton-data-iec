    <p>ISO/IEC 25020:2007 provides a measurement reference model and guide for measuring the quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 2501n, Quality Model Division. ISO/IEC 25020:2007 sets requirements for the selection and construction of quality measures. It also contains informative annexes addressing the following topics: criteria for selecting software quality measures and quality measure elements, demonstrating predictive validity and assessing measurement reliability, and an example format for documenting software quality measures.</p>
    <p>The Quality Measurement Division, of which ISO/IEC 25020 is a member, also offers examples of quality measures that can be used across the product development life cycle. These measures are defined in the other documents in the division and correspond to the quality characteristics in a software product quality model such as that described in ISO/IEC 25010. ISO/IEC 25020:2007 and the quality measures are designed to be used, in particular, with other standards in the SQuaRE series that address quality requirements (ISO/IEC 25030) and product quality evaluation (ISO/IEC 25040). </p>
