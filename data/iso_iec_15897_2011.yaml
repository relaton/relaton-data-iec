abstract:
- content: lSO/IEC 15897:2011 specifies the information that can appear in a Cultural
    Specification and defines the procedures for registering such specifications.
    The Cultural Specifications can include freeform Narrative Cultural Specifications
    and Repertoiremaps as described in lSO/IEC 15897:2011, POSIX Locales and Charmaps
    conforming to ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945, and other machine-parsable specifications such
    as FDCC-sets, Repertoiremaps and Charmaps following the recommendations of ISO/IEC
    TR 14652, and Cultural Specifications formatted using SGML or XML. The registry
    is in printed and electronic form. lSO/IEC 15897:2011 sets out the procedures
    for registering cultural elements, both as narrative text and in a more formal
    manner, using the techniques of ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945, and other machine-processable
    formats such as those specified in ISO/IEC TR 14652. lSO/IEC 15897:2011 registers
    amongst other items Narrative Cultural Specifications and Repertoiremaps, POSIX
    Locales and POSIX Charmaps as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945, and other machine-parsable
    Cultural Specifications such as ISO/IEC TR 14652 FDCC-sets, Charmaps and Repertoiremaps,
    and Cultural Specifications in SGML or XML.
