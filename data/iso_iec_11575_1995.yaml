abstract:
- content: Specifies general principles for the mappings between the OSI Data Link
    service, both connection-mode (CO-DLS) and connectionless-mode (CL-DLS), and standard
    Data Link protocols. Specifies the detailed mappings M1, M2, M5 and M6; also specifies
    the main features of the mappings M3 and M4. Does not specify individual implementations
    or products, nor does it constrain the implementation of Data Link entities and
    interfaces within an information processing system.
