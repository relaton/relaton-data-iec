    <p>ISO/IEC 33004:2015 sets out the requirements for process reference models, process assessment models, and maturity models. The requirements defined in this International Standard form a structure which specifies</p>
    <p>a)    the relationship between the classes of process model associated with the performance of process assessment,</p>
    <p>b)    the relationship between process reference models and prescriptive/normative models of process performance, as constituted by, for example, the activities and tasks defined in ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288,</p>
    <p>c)    the integration of process reference models and process measurement frameworks to establish process assessment models,</p>
    <p>d)    the use of common sets of assessment indicators of process performance and process quality in process assessment models, and</p>
    <p>e)    the relationship between maturity models and process assessment models and the extent to which a maturity model can be constructed using elements from different process assessment models.</p>
