  content: 'IEC TR 62150-7: 2024 which is a technical report, provides simple calculation
    guidelines for the laser safety class of optical transceivers and transmitters,
    whose baseline standard is IEC 60825-1. The calculation methodology for Class
    1 and Class 1M safety levels is the main scope of this document, because most
    of optical transceivers and transmitters are specified for these classifications.
    The calculations and classifications in this document follow IEC 60825-1, which
    specifically advises that laser safety classifications be based on tests that
    consider any reasonably foreseeable single-fault condition in the application
    of a transceiver or transmitter. More information can be found in IEC 60825-1:2014,
    5.1.'
