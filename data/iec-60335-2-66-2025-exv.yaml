  content: "IEC 60335-2-66:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-66:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-66:2025 deals with the safety
    of electric water-bed heaters and their associated control units, for household
    and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V, including
    direct current (DC) supplied appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use, but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used in hotels, are within the scope of this
    standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common
    hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around
    the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons
    (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of
    experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without
    supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or in aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to appliances<br />\r\n– for medical purposes
    (IEC 60601 series);<br />\r\n– intended for immersion in water during use.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2002, Amendment 1: 2008 and Amendment 2:2011. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 19.4, 22.101);<br
    />\r\nc) clarification of requirements for remote operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
