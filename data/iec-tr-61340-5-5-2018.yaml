  content: "IEC TR 61340-5-5:2018(E) discusses packaging material requirements for
    electrostatic discharge sensitive items (ESDS) as well as non–ESDS which can apply
    to packaging materials such as embossed carrier tape, trays, tubes (stick magazines),
    rails and others used in back end line processing and parts handling where test
    methods described in other standards are, for the most part, inadequate. Issues
    related to electrostatic charge generation, electrostatic attraction and repulsion
    are included. The recommendations and discussions within this document can also
    be applicable to other types of packaging that cannot be evaluated by other means.<br
    />\r\nThis document discusses the issues related to<br />\r\n1)   technical considerations
    for packaging material selection and packaging system design,<br />\r\n2)   packaging
    material specifications for electrostatic control,<br />\r\n3)   existing test
    methods and their limitations for packaging materials,<br />\r\n4)   suggestions
    for the evaluation of small dimension packaging materials, and<br />\r\n5)   industry
    common practices."
