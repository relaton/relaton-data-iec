abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 23004-2:2007 specifies the multimedia application programming
    interface (API) of the MPEG Multimedia Middleware (M3W) technology. This Multimedia
    API provides a flexible interoperable set of media functions suitable for use
    in multiple products with different capabilities and in multiple application domains.   ISO/IEC
    23004-2:2007 specifies the following:     interfaces for audio broadcast decoding,
    processing and rendering;    interfaces for video broadcast decoding, processing
    and rendering;    IPMP interfaces;    governance interfaces.      These interfaces
    provide a uniform view to the multimedia functionality offered by M3W platforms,
    but are flexible enough to allow different M3W platform vendors to distinguish
    themselves.'
