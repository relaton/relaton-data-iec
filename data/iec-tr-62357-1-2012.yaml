  content: IEC/TR 62357-1:2012(E) specifies a reference architecture and framework
    for the development and application of IEC standards for the exchange of power
    system information. This technical report provides an overview of these standards
    as well as guidelines and general principles for their application in distribution,
    transmission, and generation systems involved in electric utility operations and
    planning. The future multi-layer reference architecture described in this technical
    report takes into account new concepts and evolving technologies, such as semantic
    modelling and canonical data models, in order to build on technology trends of
    other industries and standards activities to achieve the interoperability goals
    of the Smart Grid.
