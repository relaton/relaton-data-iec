abstract:
- content: "IEC 62149-5:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62149-5:2020
    specifies performance on the transceiver modules for asynchronous-transfer-mode
    passive optical network (ATM-PON) systems recommended by the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) in ITU-T Recommendation G.983.1. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2009 and constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- description of types in Clause 4 has been removed;<br
    />\r\n- titles of reference documents have been updated."
