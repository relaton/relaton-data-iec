abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-1-102:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61196-1-102:2025
    applies to coaxial communication cables. It specifies test methods for determining
    the insulation resistance of coaxial cables. It is intended to detect the flaws
    in the dielectric of finished coaxial cables. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition, published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the scope was extended;<br />\r\nb)
    the procedure is updated for the period of discharge and the test sample with
    high insulation resistance;<br />\r\nc) the unit of cable length has been amended;<br
    />\r\nd) the test procedures for the cables with special structure are specified
    in Annex A."
