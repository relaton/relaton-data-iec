  content: "IEC 60286-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60286-5:2018
    describes the common dimensions, tolerances and characteristics of the tray. It
    includes only those dimensions that are essential for the handling of the trays
    for the stated purpose and for placing or removing components from the trays.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The generic rules for the design of matrix
    trays are given in this document. Newly developed trays which follow these rules
    will not be listed individually. Only those trays which conform to the design
    rules set forth herein are classified as \"standard trays\" and are thus preferred
    for use.<br />\r\n- An update of the matrix trays, which do not conform to the
    design rules set forth herein, are considered as \"non-standard trays\" and are
    not preferred for use, is listed in Annex A.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
