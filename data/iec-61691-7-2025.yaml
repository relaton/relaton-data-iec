  content: "IEC 61967-7:2025 defines SystemC® with Transaction Level Modeling (TLM)
    as an ISO standard C++ class library for system and hardware design. SystemC®1
    as an ANSI standard C++ class library for system and hardware design.<br />\r\nThe
    general purpose of this standard is to provide a C++-based standard for designers
    and architects who need to address complex systems that are a hybrid between hardware
    and software. The specific purpose of this standard is to provide a precise and
    complete definition of the SystemC class library including a TLM library so that
    a SystemC implementation can be developed with reference to this standard alone.
    This standard is not intended to serve as a user’s guide or to provide an introduction
    to SystemC, but it does contain useful information for end users.<br />\r\nThe
    changes with respect to the previous edition are provided in Annex D.<br />\r\nThis
    standard is published as a double logo IEC-IEEE standard."
