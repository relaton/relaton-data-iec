abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15992:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Call Priority Interruption (SS-CPI) and Call Priority Interruption Protection
    (SS-CPIP) supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated
    services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN).</p><p>NOTE This edition of ISO/IEC 15992:2003 does not
    apply to calls using the circuit-mode multiple rate bearer service.</p><p>SS-CPI
    allows a call request for a priority call to proceed successfully in the case
    that there is no user information channel available. This is accomplished by force
    releasing an established call of lower priority.</p><p>SS-CPIP allows for the
    protection of calls against interruption from priority calls.</p><p>The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC
    15992:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    15991.</p><p>The signalling protocol for SS-CPI(P) operates on top of the signalling
    protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572,
    and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary
    services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15992:2003 also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between SS-CPI(P) and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p>"
