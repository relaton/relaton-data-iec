  content: "This part of IEC 60092 specifies requirements for all electric propulsion
    plant and gives the specifications, system design, installation and testing of
    at least :-generators and their prime movers;-switchboards;-transformers/reactors;-semiconductor
    convertors;-propulsion motors;-excitation systems;-control, monitoring and safety
    systems;-wires, cables, busbars, trunking systems.\nThis edition included the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    a)-requirements regarding system responsibility, electromagnetic compatibility
    (EMC), harmonic distorsion and filtering, special requirements for ships with
    propulsion motor(s) and podded drives, and power management system (PMS); \nb)-overall
