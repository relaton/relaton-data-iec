abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11770-1:2010 defines a general model of key management that is
    independent of the use of any particular cryptographic algorithm. However, certain
    key distribution mechanisms can depend on particular algorithm properties, for
    example, properties of asymmetric algorithms.ISO/IEC 11770-1:2010 contains the
    material required for a basic understanding of subsequent parts.Examples of the
    use of key management mechanisms are included in ISO 11568. If non-repudiation
    is required for key management, ISO/IEC 13888 is applicable.ISO/IEC 11770-1:2010
    addresses both the automated and manual aspects of key management, including outlines
    of data elements and sequences of operations that are used to obtain key management
    services. However it does not specify details of protocol exchanges that might
    be needed.As with other security services, key management can only be provided
    within the context of a defined security policy. The definition of security policies
    is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 11770.The fundamental problem is to establish
    keying material whose origin, integrity, timeliness and (in the case of secret
    keys) confidentiality can be guaranteed to both direct and indirect users. Key
    management includes functions such as the generation, storage, distribution, deletion
    and archiving of keying material in accordance with a security policy (ISO 7498-2).ISO/IEC
    11770-1:2010 has a special relationship to the security frameworks for open systems
    (ISO/IEC 10181). All the frameworks, including this one, identify the basic concepts
    and characteristics of mechanisms covering different aspects of security.
