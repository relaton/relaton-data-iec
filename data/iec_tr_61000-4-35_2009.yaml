abstract:
- content: IEC&#x2F;TR 61000-4-35:2009(E) provides information about extant system-level
    High-Power Electromagnetic (HPEM) simulators and their applicability as test facilities
    and validation tools for immunity test requirements in accordance with the IEC
    61000 series of standards. HPEM simulators with the capability of conducted susceptibility
    or immunity testing will be included in a further stage of the project. In the
    sense of this report the group of HPEM simulators consists of narrow band microwave
    test facilities and wideband simulators for radiated high power electromagnetic
    fields. IEC 61000-2-13 defines high power electromagnetic (HPEM) radiated environments
    as those with a peak power density that exceeds 26 W&#x2F;m2 (100 V&#x2F;m or
    0,27 A&#x2F;m). This part of IEC 61000 focuses on a sub-set of HPEM simulators
    capable of achieving much higher fields. Therefore, the HPEM radiated environments
    used in this document are characterized by a peak power density exceeding 663
    W&#x2F;m2 (500 V&#x2F;m or 1,33 A&#x2F;m). The intention of this report is to
    provide the first detailed listing of both narrowband (hypoband) and wideband
    (mesoband, sub-hyperband and hyperband) simulators throughout the world. HEMP
    simulators are the subject of a separate compendium (IEC 61000-4-32) and thus
    are outside the scope of this Technical Report. After an introduction, a general
    description of HPEM simulators, as listed in this Technical Report, is presented.
    A database has been created by collecting information from simulator owners and
    operators and this data is presented for the technical characterization of the
    test facilities. In addition, some important commercial aspects, such as availability
    and operational status, are also addressed.
