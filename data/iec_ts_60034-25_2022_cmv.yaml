abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60034-25:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC TS 60034-25:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC
    TS 60034-25:2014 edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 2 experts are
    provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any
    part of the content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 60034-25:2022 describes the performance
    characteristics of AC electrical machines for use on converter supplies. For electrical
    machines specifically designed for converter duty application design features
    are defined. It also specifies the interface parameters and interactions between
    the electrical machine and the converter including installation guidance as part
    of a power drive system, but except for the voltage at the power interface which
    is described in IEC TS 61800-8. This fourth edition of IEC TS 60034-25 cancels
    and replaces the third edition, This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. The definitions
    of a converter capable motor and a converter duty motor are added.<br />\r\nb.
    Clause 18 modified to include the performance expectations of a converter capable
    motor.<br />\r\nc. Clause 8 modified to update shaft currents section.<br />\r\nd.
    Annex D added to define the derating requirements."
