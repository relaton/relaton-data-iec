  content: "IEC 63171-1:2024 is part of the IEC 63171 series which is a set of International
    Standards covering shielded or unshielded free and fixed connectors for balanced
    single-pair data transmission with current carrying capacity.<br />\r\nIEC 63171
    is the general requirements and tests part (general specifications) of the whole
    series. Subsequent parts, such as this Part 1, are product detail specifications
    of the series IEC 63171 and do not duplicate information given in IEC 63171, but
    list only additional requirements. Each subsequent part is identified by a type
    of connector covered with the same number identifying the part. Some parts can
    describe more embodiments, with different connectors geometries (rectangular,
    circular), sharing the core element and the relevant features.<br />\r\nThis part
    of IEC 63171 covers two-way, shielded or unshielded, free and fixed connectors
    known as Type 1, for balanced single-pair data transmission with frequencies up
    to 600 MHz and with current carrying capacity up to 2,0 A at 60 °C.<br />\r\nIt
    specifies the common dimensions, and provides the mechanical, electrical, signal
    integrity, and environmental characteristics, the reliability specifications and
    corresponding tests for these connectors.<br />\r\nFor the complete specifications
    regarding a connector of this series, both the general specification and the relevant
    detail specification are therefore required.<br />\r\nFor the qualification of
    a connector of this series, both the general specification and the relevant detail
    specification shall be met.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision
    and includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n* Information on obtaining a license agreement was updated.<br
    />\r\n* Connector characteristics and test requirements were aligned with IEC
    63171:2021 where applicable.<br />\r\n* Added requirements for Polarizing method
    (5.6.4) and Dynamic stress (5.6.5) to align with IEC 63171:2021.<br />\r\n* Added
    test group BP - Moisture (6.7.3.4) to align with IEC 63171:2021."
