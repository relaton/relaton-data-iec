    <p>This document, within the context of methods and tools for product line product management<b>:</b></p>
    <p>—          defines product line-specific processes and their subprocesses for product management of software and systems product lines. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;</p>
    <p>—          defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;</p>
    <p>—          defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.</p>
    <p>This document does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.</p>
