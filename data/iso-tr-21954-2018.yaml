  content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO TR 21954:2018 This document considers
    and identifies criteria about the intended patient, intended use environment,
    and intended operator across the spectrum of the types of ventilation-related
    equipment as listed below:<br />\r\n— gas-powered resuscitator as specified in
    ISO 10651-5[1] [1];<br />\r\n— operator-powered resuscitator as specified in ISO
    10651-4[2];<br />\r\n— ventilator for critical care as specified in ISO 80601-2-12[3]
    [2];<br />\r\n— ventilator for emergency medical services environment as specified
    in ISO 80601-2-84[4] [3], the future replacement for ISO 10651-3[5];<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 ISO 80601‐2‐84 updates the content of ISO 10651‐3 and harmonizes it with IEC
    60601-1:2005+AMD1:2012[6] and IEC 60601-1-12:2014[7].<br />\r\n— ventilator for
    ventilatory impairment in the home healthcare environment as specified in ISO
    80601‑2‑79[8];<br />\r\n— ventilator for ventilatory insufficiency in the home
    healthcare environment as specified in ISO 80601‑2‑80[9];<br />\r\n— ventilator
    for ventilator-dependent patients in the home healthcare environment as specified
    in ISO 80601-2-72[10];<br />\r\n— sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment as
    specified in ISO 80601-2-70[11].<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Sleep apnoea breathing therapy
    equipment is not considered to be an artificial ventilator. It is included in
    this discussion to highlight the differences, which indicate why sleep apnoea
    breathing therapy equipment is not considered a ventilator.<br />\r\nThis document
    is intended to provide guidance that can assist manufacturers, authorities having
    jurisdiction and users in the development, selection and application of different
    types of ventilatory equipment based on the intended patient, intended use environment
    and intended operator.<br />\r\n[1] Numbers in square brackets refer to the Bibliography.<br
