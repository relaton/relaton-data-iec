abstract:
- content: IEC 62394:2017 specifies requirements for service diagnostic software to
    be implemented in products that incorporate a digital interface. The Service Diagnostic
    Interface (SDI) requires an external controller (exclusive or general-purpose/PC)
    into which service diagnostic software can be loaded. Parts of the controller
    software should be standardized while other parts should be unique to the manufacturer.
    The SDI is based upon ECHONET specification version 2.11, ECHONET Lite specification
    version 1.11, and APPENDIX Detailed Requirements for ECHONET Device objects Release
    G, because this interface will be used in future products. The use of this connection
    and existing communication protocols enable implementation in products at a low
    cost, with maximum flexibility and efficiency.
