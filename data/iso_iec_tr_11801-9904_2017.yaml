abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC TR 11801-9904:2017(E) This technical report provides guidance
    on whether installed Class D and Class E channels specified in ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801:2002
    will support 2,5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T. It also provides mitigation procedures to
    improve the perfomance of Class D and Class E channels to the point where these
    applications are supported. Higher classes according to ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801:2002
    will support 2,5GBASE-T and 5GBASE-T without mitigation up to 100 m.
