  content: "IEC 61340-5-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61340-5-1:2016 applies
    to activities that: manufacture, process, assemble, install, package, label, service,
    test, inspect, transport or otherwise handle electrical or electronic parts, assemblies
    and equipment with withstand voltages greater than or equal to 100 V HBM, 200
    V CDM and 35 V for isolated conductors. ESDS with lower withstand voltages may
    require additional control elements or adjusted limits. Processes designed to
    handle items that have lower ESD withstand voltage(s) can still claim compliance
    to this standard. This standard provides the requirements for an ESD control program.
    IEC TR 61340-5-2 [9] provides guidance on the implementation of this standard.
    This standard does not apply to electrically initiated explosive devices, flammable
    liquids, gases and powders. The purpose of this standard is to provide the<br
    />\r\nadministrative and technical requirements for establishing, implementing
    and maintaining an ESD control program (hereinafter referred to as the \"program\").
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Technical requirements were changed to align
    IEC 61340-5-1 with other industry ESD standards;<br />\r\nb) Reference documents
    were updated to reflect newly released IEC standards;<br />\r\nc) A section on
    product qualification was added;<br />\r\nd) Table 4 was deleted and detailed
    packaging requirements were deferred to IEC 61340-5-3;<br />\r\ne) Clause A.1
    was removed and is now included in IEC 61340-4-6.<br />\r\nThe contents of the
    corrigendum of May 2017 have been included in this copy."
