abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30115:2018:<br />\r\nThe Redfish Scalable Platforms Management
    API (\"Redfish\") is a new specification that uses RESTful interface semantics
    to access data defined in model format to perform out-of-band systems management.
    It is suitable for a wide range of servers, from stand-alone servers to rack mount
    and bladed environments but scales equally well for large scale cloud environments.<br
    />\r\nThere are several out-of-band systems management standards (defacto and
    de jour) available in the industry. They all either vary widely in implementation,
    were developed for single server embedded environments or have their roots in
    antiquated software modeling constructs. There is no single industry standard
    that is simple to use, based on emerging programming standards, embedded friendly
    and capable of meeting large scale data center & cloud needs.<br />\r\nThe electronic
    version of this International Standard can be  downloaded  from the ISO/IEC Information
    Technology Task Force (ITTF) website."
