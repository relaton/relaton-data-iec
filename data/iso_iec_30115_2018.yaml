abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 30115:2018:</p><p>The Redfish Scalable Platforms Management
    API ("Redfish") is a new specification that uses RESTful interface semantics to
    access data defined in model format to perform out-of-band systems management.
    It is suitable for a wide range of servers, from stand-alone servers to rack mount
    and bladed environments but scales equally well for large scale cloud environments.</p><p>There
    are several out-of-band systems management standards (defacto and de jour) available
    in the industry. They all either vary widely in implementation, were developed
    for single server embedded environments or have their roots in antiquated software
    modeling constructs. There is no single industry standard that is simple to use,
    based on emerging programming standards, embedded friendly and capable of meeting
    large scale data center &amp; cloud needs.</p>
