- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 18001:2004 provides:</p><ul><li>the result of three surveys
    identifying the applications for radio frequency identification (RFID) in an item
    management environment, and the resultant classification of these applications
    based on various operational parameters, including operating range and memory
    size;</li><li>an explanation of some of the issues associated with the parameters
    of distance and number of tags within an RFID interrogator's field-of-view;</li><li>a
    means by which classification of RF tags may be accomplished based on the application
    requirements defined in the survey results;</li><li>recommendations for areas
    of standardization to the parent committee (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 31/WG 4) based on
