  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-4:2020(E), which is a Technical Report, is intended for
    an audience familiar with network communication and/or IEC 61850-based systems
    and particularly for substation protection and control equipment vendors, network
    equipment vendors and system integrators.<br />\r\nThis document focuses on engineering
    a local area network limited to the requirements of IEC 61850-based substation
    automation. It outlines the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches
    to network topology, redundancy, clock synchronization, etc. so that the network
    designer can make educated decisions. In addition, this document outlines possible
    improvements to both substation automation and networking equipment.<br />\r\nThis
    document addresses data transfer over the network in IEC 61850, such as transmitting
    tripping commands for protection via GOOSE messages, and in particular the multicast
    data transfer of large volumes of sampled values (SV) from merging units (MUs).<br
    />\r\nThis document considers seamless redundancy to increase the network availability
    under failure conditions and the high precision clock synchronization that is
    central to the process bus and synchrophasor operation.<br />\r\nThis document
    is not intended as a tutorial on networking or on IEC 61850. Rather, it references
    and summarizes standards and publications to assist the engineers. Many publications
    discuss the Ethernet technology but do not address the networks in terms of substation
    automation. Therefore, many technologies and options have been ignored, since
    they were not considered relevant for a future-proof substation automation network
    design.<br />\r\nThis document does not address network-based security, which
    is the subject of IEC 62351 and IEC 62443.<br />\r\nThis document does not address
    technologies for wide area networks; these are covered by IEC TR 61850-90-12.
    Guidelines for communication outside of the substation that uses exclusively the
    routable Internet Protocol have been published, especially in documents IEC TR
    61850-90-1 (substation to substation), IEC TR 61850-90-2 (substation to control
    center) and IEC TR 61850-90-5 (synchrophasor transmission). However, data flows
    used in substation-to-substation communication, or substation-to-control centre
    communication such as R-GOOSE and R-SV are covered when they transit over Ethernet
    links within the substation.<br />\r\nThis document does not dispense the responsible
    system integrator from an analysis of the actual application configuration, which
    is the base for a dependable system<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n• New object model for bridges and clocks based
    on UML autogeneration.<br />\r\n• An example of SCL configuration with a topology<br
    />\r\n• Extensions to the time distribution and clock<br />\r\n• Extension of
    the testing"
