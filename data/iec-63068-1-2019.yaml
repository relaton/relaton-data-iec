  content: IEC 63068-1:2019(E) gives a classification of defects in as-grown 4H-SiC
    (Silicon Carbide) epitaxial layers. The defects are classified on the basis of
    their crystallographic structures and recognized by non-destructive detection
    methods including bright-field OM (optical microscopy), PL (photoluminescence),
    and XRT (X-ray topography) images.
