  content: IEC 61977:2010(E) applies to the family of fibre optic filters. These are
    passive components used to select specific wavelengths. The standard covers their
    optical, mechanical and envoronmental properties; as well as the measurement and
    text procedures for quality assessment. The changes with respect to the previous
    edition include having substantially increased the number of terms, added an informative
    annex for example of filtering technologies and deleted quality assessment procedures.
