  content: "IEC TS 60695-1-14:2017(E) provides guidance about the levels of power
    and energy that could cause ignition and fire in a low voltage electrotechnical
    product. It can be used by Product Committees to determine what fire hazard safeguards
    might be used, based on the electrical energy that could be dissipated as heat.<br
    />\r\nThis document deals with products used in normal atmospheres commonly available
    in the home and does not deal with special locations such as those in explosive
    atmospheres. It is intended as guidance to IEC committees, and is intended be
    used with respect to their individual applications.<br />\r\nIt has the status
    of a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide
    51.<br />\r\nThis basic safety publication is intended for use by technical committees
    in the preparation of standards in accordance with the principles laid down in
    IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51.<br />\r\n<em>Key words: Fire Hazard, Probability
    of Ignition, Power and Energy Levels</em>"
