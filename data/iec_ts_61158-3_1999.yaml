abstract:
- content: "Provides basic time-critical messaging communications between devices
    in an automation enviornment. Defines in an abstract way the externally visible
    service provided by the Fieldbus Data Link Layer in terms of \na) the primitive
    actions and events of the service;\nb) the parameters associated with each primitive
    action and event, and the form which they take; and\nc) the interrelationship
    between these actions and events, and their valid sequence.\nThe services defined
    are a superset of those provided by OSI Data Link Protocols as specified in ISO/IEC
    8886."
