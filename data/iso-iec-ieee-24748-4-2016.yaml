    <p>The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288-12207 related</p>
    <p>standards and technical reports that are discussed in this International Standard</p>
    <p>provides detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle</p>
    <p>processes. This International Standard unifies technical and management</p>
    <p>requirements and guidance from several of these sources to specify the requirements</p>
    <p>for the content of a SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International</p>
    <p>Standard also identifies the processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to perform</p>
    <p>the necessary project planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort and</p>
    <p>to develop the project's SEMP. Due to close alignment with the content of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24748, ISO/IEC 26702 is now Part 4 of the multi-part International Standard,</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24748 (<i>Systems and software engineering </i>? <i>Life cycle management</i>).</p>
