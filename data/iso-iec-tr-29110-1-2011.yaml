    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-1:2011 introduces the major concepts required to understand and use the ISO/IEC 29110 series. It introduces the characteristics and requirements of a Very Small Entity (VSE), and clarifies the rationale for VSE-specific profiles, documents, standards and guides.</p>
    <p>It also introduces process, lifecycle and standardization concepts and defines the business terms common to the ISO/IEC 29110 series.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-1:2011 is applicable to VSEs. The lifecycle processes described in ISO/IEC 29110 are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by an entity that is larger than a VSE.</p>
