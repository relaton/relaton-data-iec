abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11976:2008 specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics
    of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-optical Phase Change
    effects to enable data interchange between such disks.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11976:2008 specifies two types of disk.<br />\r\n\tType RW (Rewritable) provides
    for data to be written, read and erased many times over the recording surfaces
    of the disk.<br />\r\n\tType WORM (Write Once Read Many) provides for data once
    written to be read a multiplicity of times. This type uses a Write Once Read Many
    times recording material (written marks cannot be erased and attempted modifications
    of the written marks are detectable). Multisession (incremental write operations)
    recording may be performed on Type WORM disks.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
    />\r\nThe disk is two-sided with a nominal capacity of 30,0 Gbytes per side and
    the cartridge (two sides) provides a nominal capacity of 60,0 Gbytes.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 11976:2008 specifies the following:<br />\r\n\tthe conditions for
    conformance testing and the Reference Drive;<br />\r\n\tthe environments in which
    the cartridges are to be operated and stored;<br />\r\n\tthe mechanical, physical
    and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge so as to provide mechanical interchangeability
    between data processing systems;<br />\r\n\tthe format of the information on the
    disk, both embossed and user-written, including the physical disposition of the
    tracks and sectors, the error correction codes, the modulation methods used;<br
    />\r\n\tthe characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;<br />\r\n\tthe
    thermo-optical characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write
    data onto the disk;<br />\r\n\tthe minimum quality of user-written data on the
    disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.<br /><br /><br
    /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 11976:2008 provides for interchange between optical
    disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides
    for full data interchange between data processing systems."
