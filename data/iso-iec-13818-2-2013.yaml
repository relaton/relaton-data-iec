  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13818-2:2013 specifies a coded representation of video data
    and the decoding process required to reconstruct pictures. It provides a generic
    video coding scheme which serves a wide range of applications, bit rates, picture
    resolutions and qualities. Its basic coding algorithm is a hybrid of motion compensated
    prediction and discrete cosine transform (DCT). Pictures to be coded can be either
    interlaced or progressive. Necessary algorithmic elements are integrated into
    a single syntax, and a limited number of subsets are defined in terms of Profile
    (functionalities) and Level (parameters) to facilitate practical use of this generic
    video coding International Standard.</p>"
