abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63291-2:2023 defines aspects on planning, specification, and execution
    of multi-vendor HVDC grid systems also referred to as HVDC grids. The terms \"HVDC
    grid systems\" or \"HVDC grids\" are used in this document to describe HVDC systems
    for power transmission having more than two HVDC stations connected to a common
    DC circuit. The DC circuit can be of radial or meshed topology or a combination
    thereof. In this document, the term \"HVDC grids\" is used.<br />\r\nWhile this
    document focuses on requirements specific for HVDC grids, some requirements are
    considered applicable to all HVDC systems in general, i.e., including point-to-point
    HVDC systems. Existing IEC (e.g., IEC TR 63363-1 [1]), Cigre or other relevant
    documents have been used for reference as far as possible.<br />\r\nCorresponding
    to electric power transmission applications, this document is applicable to high
    voltage systems, i.e., those having typically nominal DC voltages higher than
    50 kV with respect to earth are considered in this document.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒWhile
    the physical principles of DC networks are basically voltage independent, the
    technical options for designing equipment get much wider with lower DC voltage
    levels, e.g. in the case of converters or switchgear.<br />\r\nThis document covers
    technical aspects of:<br />\r\n- coordination of HVDC grid and AC systems,<br
    />\r\n- HVDC grid characteristics,<br />\r\n- HVDC grid control,<br />\r\n- HVDC
    grid protection,<br />\r\n- AC/DC converter stations,<br />\r\n- HVDC grid installations,
    including DC switching stations and HVDC transmission lines,<br />\r\n- studies
    and associated models,<br />\r\n- testing.<br />\r\nBeyond the scope of this document,
    the following content is proposed for future work:<br />\r\nDC/DC converter stations."
