  content: "IEC 60749-15:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60749-15:2020 describes
    a test used to determine whether encapsulated solid state devices used for through-hole
    mounting can withstand the effects of the temperature to which they are subjected
    during soldering of their leads by using wave soldering. In order to establish
    a standard test procedure for the most reproducible methods, the solder dip method
    is used because of its more controllable conditions. This procedure determines
    whether devices are capable of withstanding the soldering temperature encountered
    in printed wiring board assembly operations, without degrading their electrical
    characteristics or internal connections. This test is destructive and may be used
    for qualification, lot acceptance and as a product monitor. The heat is conducted
    through the leads into the device package from solder heat at the reverse side
    of the board. This procedure does not simulate wave soldering or reflow heat exposure
    on the same side of the board as the package body. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    inclusion of new Clause 3, Terms and definitions;<br />\r\n- clarification of
    the use of a soldering iron for producing the heating effect;<br />\r\n- inclusion
    an option to use accelerated ageing.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
