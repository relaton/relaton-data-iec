  content: "IEC 60512-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60512-1:2018
    is intended to be used as a basis for tests and measurements specifications for
    electrical connectors. It provides guidance and reference for tests and measurements
    within the IEC 60512 series. It includes the description and the practice of the
    various phases of tests and measurements (preparation, tests and measurements,
    requirements, documentation), in addition to basic terms and definitions applicable
    to any part of the IEC 60512 series. This standard shall be used in conjunction
    with IEC 60512-1-101 and relevant part(s) of series IEC 60512. Part 60512-1-100
    provides the list of the existing test and measuring methods published within
    series IEC 60512. Detail tests and measurements specifications are applicable
    to electrical connectors and their components (e.g. connector inserts, connector
    housings, locking mechanisms, contacts and terminations) within the scope of technical
    committee 48. They may also be used for similar devices when specified in a detail
    product specification. Detail tests and measurements specifications are used in
    conjunction with detail product specifications which prescribe the tests to be
    used, the required degree of severity for each of them and the permissible performance
    limits. The detail product specification also specifies the deviations in procedures,
    which may be required when applying a test to the type of connector or its component
    under consideration, and it further specifies any special procedures which may
    be required. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition, published
    in 2001. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    main technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n– in Clause
    3, only terms relating to the testing are defined, and IEC 61076-1 is referred
    to for terms of connectors.<br />\r\n– Clause 4 (Numbering of tests and measurement
    specification) is added.<br />\r\n– Subclause 5.1.2 (Calibration) is added.<br
    />\r\n– in Clause 6 (Test), test procedure follows IEC 60068-1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey
