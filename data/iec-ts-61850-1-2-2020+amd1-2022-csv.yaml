  content: "IEC TS 61850-1-2:2020+AMD1:2022, which is a technical specification, is
    intended for any users but primarily for standardization bodies that are considering
    using IEC 61850 as a base standard within the scope of their work and are willing
    to extend it as allowed by the IEC 61850 standards. This document identifies the
    required steps and high-level requirements in achieving such extensions of IEC
    61850 and provides guidelines for the individual steps.<br />\r\nWithin that scope,
    this document addresses the following cases:<br />\r\n• The management of product-level
    standards for products that have an interface based on IEC 61850<br />\r\n• The
    management of domain-level standards based on IEC 61850<br />\r\n• The management
    of transitional standards based on IEC 61850<br />\r\n• The management of private
    namespaces based on IEC 61850<br />\r\n• The development of standards offering
    the mapping of IEC 61850 data model at CDC level<br />\r\n• The development and
    management of IEC 61850 profiles for domains (underlying the role of IEC TR 62361-103
    and IEC TR 61850-7-6)<br />\r\nThis document includes both technical and process
    aspects:<br />\r\nOn the technical side, this document:<br />\r\n• Reminds the
    main basic requirements (mostly referring to the appropriate parts of the series
    which host the requirements or recommendations)<br />\r\n• Lists all possible
    flexibilities offered by the standards<br />\r\n• Defines which flexibilities
    are allowed/possible per type of extension cases<br />\r\nOn the process side,
    the document covers:<br />\r\n• The initial analysis of how the existing IEC 61850
    object models and/or communication services may be applied and what allowed extensions
    may be required for utilizing them in new or specific domains (including private
    ones). The results of that step are expected to be documented<br />\r\n• The extension
    of the IEC 61850 object models for new domains. The typical associated work is
    to identify existing logical nodes which can be reused \"as is\", to determine
    if existing logical nodes can be extended, or to define new logical nodes<br />\r\n•
    The purpose and process to use transitional namespaces, which are expected to
    be merged eventually into an existing standard namespace<br />\r\n• The management
    of standard namespaces<br />\r\n• The development of private namespaces"
