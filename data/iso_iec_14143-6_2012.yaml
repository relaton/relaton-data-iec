abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14143-6:2012 provides a summary of the FSM (Functional Size Measurement)
    related standards and the relationship between:a) the ISO/IEC 14143 series FSM
    framework standards that provide the definitions and concepts of FSM and conformance
    and verification of FSMMs (Functional Size Measurement Methods), and b) the ISO/IEC
    standard FSMMs, i.e. ISO/IEC 19761 (COSMIC), ISO/IEC 20926 (IFPUG), ISO/IEC 20968
    (Mk II), ISO/IEC 24570 (NESMA), and ISO/IEC 29881 (FiSMA).An FSMM is a software
    sizing method that conforms to the mandatory requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1.
    ISO/IEC 14143-6:2012 also provides a process to assist users to select an FSMM
    that meets their requirements. It also gives guidance on how to use Functional
    Size (FS). FSMMs include, but are not limited to, ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926,
    ISO/IEC 20968, ISO/IEC 24570, and ISO/IEC 29881 as well. Recommending a specific
    FSMM is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 14143-6:2012.
