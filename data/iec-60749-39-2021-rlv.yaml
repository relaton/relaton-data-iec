  content: "IEC 60749-39:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60749-39:2021
    details the procedures for the measurement of the characteristic properties of
    moisture diffusivity and water solubility in organic materials used in the packaging
    of semiconductor components. These two material properties are important parameters
    for the effective reliability performance of plastic packaged semiconductors after
    exposure to moisture and being subjected to high-temperature solder reflow. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- updated procedure for \"dry weight\" determination."
