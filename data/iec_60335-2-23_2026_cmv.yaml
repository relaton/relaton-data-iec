abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-23:2026 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-23:2026 edition 7.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-23:2016+AMD1:2019
    CSV edition 6.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-23:2026 deals with the safety of electric
    appliances for the care of the hair of persons or animals and similar appliances,
    intended for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more
    than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within the scope of this
    standard are:<br />\r\n- curling combs;<br />\r\n- curling irons;<br />\r\n- hairdryers;<br
    />\r\n- hair straighteners;<br />\r\n- hand dryers;<br />\r\n- heaters for detachable
    curlers;<br />\r\n- permanent-wave appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances covered by
    this standard can incorporate steam-producing or spray-producing devices. Hand
    dryers can have a feature to redirect the air so that it can be used to dry the
    face or hair. Appliances not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this
    standard. Examples are appliances for use in hairdressing salons.<br />\r\nThis
    standard deals with the reasonably foreseeable hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- it
    is recognized that persons having very extensive and complex disabilities can
    have needs beyond the level addressed in this standard.<br />\r\n- for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- shavers, hair clippers and similar appliances (IEC 60335-2-8);<br />\r\n-
    cosmetic and beauty care appliances incorporating lasers and intense light sources
    (IEC 60335-2-113);<br />\r\n- appliances intended for skin care (IEC 60335-2-115).<br
    />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in
    2016 and Amendment 1:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 11.101, 20.1);<br />\r\nc) change in
    standard title and relocation of skin care appliances, such as facial saunas and
    foot care appliances, to IEC 60335-2-115 (Clause 1, 3.1.9, 3.5.103, 6.1, 7.12,
    8.1.4, 11.8, 15.2, 21.1);<br />\r\nd) clarification of testing of appliances with
    PTC heating elements (10.1, 10.2);<br />\r\ne) clarification of the application
    of test probe 18 for appliances for use in hairdressing salons (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3,
    B.22.4);<br />\r\nf) addition of accessible surface temperature limits including
    marking of hot surfaces (7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.14, 7.15, 11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ng)
    clarification of placement of the appliance in the test corner (19.2);<br />\r\nh)
    addition of moisture resistance and strength tests for detachable power supply
    parts (6.2, 21.102, 21.103, 24.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
