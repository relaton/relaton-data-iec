  content: IEC/TS 62492-2:2013(E) applies to radiation thermometry and addresses all
    technical data specified in IEC/TS 62492-1. It defines standard test methods which
    can be used by the end user of radiation thermometers to determine or confirm
    the fundamental metrological data of radiation thermometers with one wavelength
    range and one measurement field. It facilitates comparability and testability.
    Therefore, unambiguous test methods are stipulated for determining technical data,
    under standardised measuring conditions that can be performed by a sufficiently
    skilled end user to serve as standard performance criteria for instrument evaluation
    or selection.
