    the specific requirements for switches incorporated into or integrated with electric
    motor-operated hand-held tools, transportable tools and lawn and garden machinery.<br
    />\r\nThis document is intended for switches with an ambient temperature up to
    and including 55 °C. Switches tested according to IEC 61058-1 are considered to
    comply with this document and additional testing is not required provided ratings,
    loads, and endurance are correct.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2016. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant change with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\nOverall format to support IEC 61058-1, IEC 61058-1-1 and IEC
