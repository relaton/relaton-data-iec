    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60068-2-5:2018
    specifies the methods for testing equipment or components under simulated solar
    radiation conditions. This document is applicable to the equipment and components
    at the surface of the earth. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition of published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- the title of this document has been modified;<br
    />\r\n- the current thermal effect test method, specified as \"Test method Sa\"
    has been retained and the weathering test method specified as \"Test method Sb\"
    has been added.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n</ul>"
