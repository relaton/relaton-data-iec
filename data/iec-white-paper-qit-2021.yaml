  content: "Quantum technology is an emerging field that brings together engineering
    and physics. Exploiting the effects of quantum mechanics, quantum information
    technology (QIT) opens new possibilities in computing that exceed the capacity
    of conventional computing systems. While still at a nascent stage, QIT has attracted
    much attention from national governments as an area of critical research.<br />\r\nThis
    white paper addresses a wide range of issues related to quantum technologies and
    the role of standardization. It provides an overview of its current state of development
    from the perspective of research and technology, industry and market readiness.<br
    />\r\nThe white paper also provides an overview of the current status of standardization
    activities underway. It addresses standardization readiness and its link to technology
    readiness level, as well as the challenges for effective standardization. Because
    research on QIT is in progress, it will be important to coordinate the development
    of standards with the status of research underway. In order to avoid gaps in standardization,
    the active engagement of industry is necessary to prepare a cohesive suite of
    standards.<br />\r\nThe white paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board
    (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>) quantum information technology project
    team directed by Professor Dongsub Kim, Mokpo National University (Korea), with
    major contributions from the project partner, Korea Institute of Machinery and
    Materials (KIMM).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for <a
    href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/quantum-information-technology\">free download</a>."
