abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016 establishes a set of terms and definitions which may
    be used when discussing software entitlements (an important part of software licenses).
    It also provides specifications for a transport format which enables the digital
    encapsulation of software entitlements, including associated metrics and their
    management.<p>This common set of terms and associated transport format is intended
    to facilitate the management of software entitlements. The intended benefits of
    the better management of entitlements include easier demonstration of proof of
    ownership, cost optimization of the use of entitlements and easier license compliance
    management.</p><p>Furthermore, one of the benefits of having a standard for entitlement
    structure is that it may encourage the normalization by industry of names for
    and the details of, different types of entitlements. A common lexicon is critical
    to standardization and shared understanding. The terms in this part of ISO/IEC
    19770 should form a part of that lexicon over time.</p><p>It should be noted that
    within this text, attributes of an XML entity will be denoted with angle brackets,.
    XML elements are noted with quotes, "Element".</p><p>ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016 deals
    only with software entitlements, which are defined as the subset of software licenses
    that are concerned with usage rights. It is expected that the original documentation
    of licensing terms and conditions will be definitive for legal purposes, and will
    always take precedence over the Ent encapsulation.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016
    does not detail ITAM processes required for discovery and management of software
    (which is provided for in ISO/IEC 19770‑1) or software identification tags (as
    defined by ISO/IEC 19770‑2).</p><p>ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016 does not consider identifying
    mechanisms for product activation.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19770-3:2016 is not intended
    to conflict with any organization's policies, procedures and standards, or with
    any national laws and regulations. Any such conflict should be resolved before
    using this part of ISO/IEC 19770. In case the conflict cannot be resolved, the
    specification shall not be implemented.</p>
