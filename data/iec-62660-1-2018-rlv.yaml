  content: "IEC 62660-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62660-1:2018
    specifies performance and life testing of secondary lithium-ion cells used for
    propulsion of electric vehicles including battery electric vehicles (BEV) and
    hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This document specifies the test procedures to
    obtain the essential characteristics of lithium-ion cells for vehicle propulsion
    applications regarding capacity, power density, energy density, storage life and
    cycle life. This document provides the standard test procedures and conditions
    for testing basic performance characteristics of lithium-ion cells for vehicle
    propulsion applications, which are indispensable for securing a basic level of
    performance and obtaining essential data on cells for various designs of battery
    systems and battery packs. IEC 62660-1:2018 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) The purpose of each test has been added.<br />\r\nb) The
    power test has been revised for clarification, and an informative part of the
    current-voltage characteristic test has been moved to the new Annex C."
