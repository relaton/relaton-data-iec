abstract:
- content: Provides an interface between digital test generation tools and test equipment.
    A test description language is defined that:(a) facilitates the transfer of digital
    test vector data from CAE to ATE environments;(b) specifies patten, format, and
    timing information sufficant to define the application of digital test vectors
    to a DUT;and (c) supports the volume of test vector data generated from structured
    tests.
