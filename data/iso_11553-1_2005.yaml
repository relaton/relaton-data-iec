abstract:
- content: 'ISO 11553-1:2005 describes hazards generated by laser processing machines,
    and specifies the safety requirements relating to radiation hazards and hazards
    generated by materials and substances. It also specifies the information to be
    supplied by the manufacturers of such equipment. Requirements dealing with noise
    as a hazard from laser processing machines are not included in ISO 11553-1:2005.
    They will be included in a subsequent amendment. ISO 11553-1:2005 is not applicable
    to laser products, or equipment containing such products, which are manufactured
    solely and expressly for the following applications: photolithography, stereolithography,
    holography, medical applications and data storage.'
