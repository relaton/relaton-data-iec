  content: "IEC 61935-2:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61935-2:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61935-2:2010
    edition 3.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 46 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61935-2:2021
    specifies test methods for balanced and coaxial cords, which are used as equipment
    cords, patch cords, and CP cords, within cabling systems, in accordance with ISO/IEC
    11801-1. The test methods and associated requirements are provided to demonstrate
    performance and reliability and to ensure compatibility of these balanced and
    coaxial cords during their operational lifetime. This document may also be used
    for providing test methodology for assessing the performance of other cords.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2010. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- inclusion of cords up to category 8.1 and
    category 8.2, as defined in ISO/IEC 11801-1."
