  content: "IEC 60749-37:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60749-37:2022
    provides a test method that is intended to evaluate and compare drop performance
    of surface mount electronic components for handheld electronic product applications
    in an accelerated test environment, where excessive flexure of a circuit board
    causes product failure. The purpose is to standardize the test board and test
    methodology to provide a reproducible assessment of the drop test performance
    of surface-mounted components while producing the same failure modes normally
    observed during product level test. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- correction
    of a previous technical error concerning test conditions;<br />\r\n- updates to
    reflect improvements in technology."
