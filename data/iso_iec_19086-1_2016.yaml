abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19086-1:2016 seeks to establish a set of common cloud SLA building blocks (concepts,
    terms, definitions, contexts) that can be used to create cloud Service Level Agreements
    (SLAs).<br />\r\nThis document specifies<br />\r\na) an overview of cloud SLAs,<br
    />\r\nb) identification of the relationship between the cloud service agreement
    and the cloud SLA,<br />\r\nc) concepts that can be used to build cloud SLAs,
    and<br />\r\nd) terms commonly used in cloud SLAs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19086-1:2016
    is for the benefit and use of both cloud service providers and cloud service customers.
    The aim is to avoid confusion and facilitate a common understanding between cloud
    service providers and cloud service customers. Cloud service agreements and their
    associated cloud SLAs vary between cloud service providers, and in some cases
    different cloud service customers can negotiate different contract terms with
    the same cloud service provider for the same cloud service. This document aims
    to assist cloud service customers when they compare cloud services from different
    cloud service providers.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19086-1:2016 does not provide a standard
    structure that can be used for a cloud SLA or a standard set of cloud service
    level objectives (SLOs) and cloud service qualitative objectives (SQOs) that will
    apply to all cloud services or all cloud service providers. This approach provides
    flexibility for cloud service providers in tailoring their cloud SLAs to the particular
    characteristics of the offered cloud services.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19086-1:2016 does
    not supersede any legal requirement."
