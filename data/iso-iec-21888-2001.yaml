    <p>This International Standard specifies the Additional Network Feature (ANF) Call Identification and Call Linkage (CIDL),</p>
    <p>which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are</p>
    <p>specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>ANF-CIDL is an additional network feature which allows the identification and correlation of calls throughout a PISN by</p>
    <p>assigning unambiguous identifiers to each new call and also, as an option, to transformed and logically linked calls.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1 - This ANF has been developed to support the use of CSTA (ISO/IEC 18051) in a networked environment, i.e. in a PISN. Use of</p>
    <p>this ANF for other applications is not precluded.</p>
    <p>Supplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This</p>
    <p>International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-CIDL. The stage 1 specification (clause 6)</p>
    <p>specifies the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the Functional Entities</p>
    <p>involved in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>
