abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO 30193:2016 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 100,0 Gbytes. It specifies
    the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and
    the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of
    such disks. User data can be written, read and overwritten many times using a
    reversible method. This disk is identified as a BD Rewritable disk.</p><p>ISO
    30193:2016 specifies the following:</p><p>- the one disk Type;</p><p>- the conditions
    for conformance;</p><p>- the environments in which the disk is to be operated
    and stored;</p><p>- the mechanical and physical characteristics of the disk, so
    as to provide mechanical interchange</p><p>between data processing systems;</p><p>-
    the format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition
    of the Tracks and Sectors;</p><p>- the error-correcting codes and the coding method
    used;</p><p>- the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling
    data processing systems to read</p><p>data from the disk.</p><p>ISO 30193:2016
    provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems.</p>"
