abstract:
- content: '<p>This part of ISO/IEC 9945 defines a standard source-code-level interface
    to command interpretation, or "shell," services and common utility programs for
    applica- tion programs. These services and programs are complementary to those
    specified by ISO/IEC 9945-1: 1990 (IEEE Std 1003.1-1990) {8}, hereinafter referred
    to as "POSIX.1 {8}." When the User Portability Utilities Option is included, this
    part of ISO/IEC 9945 has additional scope. The list of utilities and features
    is extended to provide a common interactive environment for system users and program
    developers.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 9945 has been designed to be used by both
    application programmers and system implementors. When the User Portability Utilities
    Option is included, it is also to be used by system users and program developers.
    How- ever, it is intended to be a reference document and not a tutorial on the
    use of the services, the utilities, or the interrelationships between the utilities.</p><p>The
    emphasis of this part of ISO/IEC 9945 without the User Portability Utilities Option
    is on the shell and utility functionality required by application programs (including
    "shell scripts") and not on the direct interactive use of the shell command language
    or the utilities by humans. When the User Portability Utilities Option is included,
    the emphasis is extended to support terminal users in a consistent manner across
    all conforming systems. There are three constraining factors that limit this user
    portability scope:</p><p>(1) The users in this context are limited to the group
    of individuals who are familiar with the style of interaction characteristic of
    historically derived systems based on one of the UNIX operating systems. Typical
    users would include program developers, engineers, or general purpose time-sharing
    users.</p><p>(2) The environment to be supported is a multi-user time-sharing
    system supporting character-oriented display terminals. Alternatively, it is a
    collection of single-user systems interconnected via local area networks or telephone
    lines, but with similar user interfaces. This part of ISO/IEC 9945 does not include
    support that is tailored for bit-mapped or graphics display terminals, although
    it is expected that such terminals could emu-late the character orientation required
    by this environment. When facili-ties require cursor addressability from the terminal
    hardware, this is specifically identified in this part ofISO/IEC 9945.</p><p>(3)
    The facilities to be provided are based on the historical models of the fol- lowing
    documents: the System V Interface Definition {B37}, the BSD User Manual {B46},
    the X/Open Portability Guide {B49}, and documentation for the KornShell {B38}.
    Emphasis is placed on standardizing existing practice for existing users, with
    changes or additions limited to correcting deficiencies in the following areas:</p><p>(a)
    Support for international character sets and other localization requirements,
    such as date formats, collation sequences, etc.</p><p>(b) Reconciliation of differences
    between the historical implementa­tions.</p><p>(c) Elimination of system or device
    dependencies.</p><p>(d) Corrections of features that could reduce system or user
    security/integrity.</p><p>Portions of this part of ISO/IEC 9945 comprise optional
    language bindings to sys-tern service interfaces. (See, for example, the C-Language
    Bindings Option in Annex B.) This part of ISO/IEC 9945 is intended to describe
    language interfaces and utilities in sufficient detail so that an application
    developer can understand the required interfaces without access to the source
    code of existing implementations on which they may be based. Therefore, it does
    not attempt to describe the source programming language or internal design of
    the utilities; they should be, considered "black boxes" that exhibit the described
    functionality.</p><p>For language interfaces, or functions, this part of ISO/IEC
    9945 has been defined exclusively at the source-code level. The objective is that
    a conforming portable application source program can be translated to execute
    on a conforming implementation. This part of ISO/IEC 9945 assumes that the source
    program may need to be retranslated to produce target code for a new environment
    prior to execution in that environment.</p><p>There is no requirement that the
    base operating system supporting the shell and utilities be one that fully conforms
    to ISO/1EC 9945-1: 1990 {8}. (The base system could contain a subset of POSIX.1
    {8} functionality, enough to support the require- ments for this part of ISO/IEC
    9945 as described in 2.9.1, but it could not claim full conformance to all of
    POSIX.l {8}.) Furthermore, there is no requirement that the shell command interpreter
    or any of the standard utilities be written as POSIX.1 {8} conforming programs
    or be written in any particular language.</p><p>Although not requiring a fully
    conforming POSIX.1 {8} base, this part of ISO/IEC 9945 is based upon documentation
    and the knowledge of existing programs that assume an interface and architecture
    similar to that described by POSIX.1 {8}. Any questions regarding the definition
    of terms or the semantics of an underlying concept should be referred to POSIX.1
    {8}.</p>'
