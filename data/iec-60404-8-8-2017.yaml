  content: "IEC 60404-8-8:2017(E) defines the grades of thin non-oriented electrical
    steel strip and sheet in nominal thicknesses of 0,05 mm, 0,10 mm, 0,15 mm, 0,20
    mm, 0,25 mm, 0,30 mm and 0,35 mm and of thin grain-oriented electrical steel strip
    and sheet in nominal thicknesses of 0,05 mm, 0,10 mm, 0,15 mm and 0,18 mm. In
    particular, it gives general requirements, magnetic properties, geometric characteristics
    and tolerances, technological characteristics, as well as inspection procedures.<br
    />\r\nNOTE For thin non-oriented electrical steel strip and sheet, other nominal
    thicknesses (i.e. 0,12 mm, 0,18 mm, 0,23 mm and 0,27 mm) can be agreed between
    the manufacturer and the purchaser.<br />\r\nThis document applies to electrical
    steel strip and sheet supplied in the finally annealed condition in coils or sheets
    and intended for the construction of magnetic circuits predominantly used at frequencies
    in the range from 100 Hz to 10 kHz.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    extension of the range of electrical steels to include the improved grades.\r\n<p
