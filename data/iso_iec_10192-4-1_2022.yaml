abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 10192-4-1:2022 specifies an architecture for home cluster
    systems and for interworking among them. It specifies a cluster-to-cluster interface
    to enable interworking among home cluster systems and interoperability among the
    applications supported by these cluster systems as well as a common user interface
    to these cluster-system applications. This common user interface provides input
    and output methods for user information exchange to access, monitor and control
    applications running on home cluster systems.
