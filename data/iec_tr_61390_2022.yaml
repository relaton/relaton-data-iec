abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61390:2022 describes representative methods of measuring the performance
    of complete real-time medical ultrasonic imaging equipment in the frequency range
    0,5 MHz to 23 MHz.<br />\r\nThis document is relevant for real-time ultrasonic
    scanners based on the pulse-echo principle, for the types listed below:<br />\r\n-
    mechanical sector scanner;<br />\r\n- electronic phased array sector scanner;<br
    />\r\n- electronic linear array scanner;<br />\r\n-electronic curved array sector
    scanner;<br />\r\n- water-bath scanner based on any of the above four scanning
    mechanisms;<br />\r\n- plane-wave/fast imaging scanners;<br />\r\n- combination
    of several of the above methods (e.g. a linear array phased at the edge to produce
    a sector there to enlarge the field of view.<br />\r\nThe methods described are
    based on evaluation of:<br />\r\n- sonograms obtained by scanning of tissue mimicking
    objects (phantoms);<br />\r\n- sonograms obtained by scanning of artificial, low-
    or highly reflective targets in suitable environments;<br />\r\n- parameters of
    the ultrasound field transmitted by the measured scanner.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not relate to methods for measuring electrical parameters of the scannerâ€™s
    electronic systems.<br />\r\nIEC TR 61390:2022 cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 1996. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Several additional phantom designs are included
    in the main body of the document;<br />\r\nb) Several additional transducer types
    are included in the Scope;<br />\r\nc) Methods of analysis are presented in new
    Annex B."
