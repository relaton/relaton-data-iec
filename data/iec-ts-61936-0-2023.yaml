  content: "IEC TS 61936-0:2023 provides principles to ensure the coherence amongst
    HV publications to be observed necessary for the coordination of the design, selection
    of equipment, operation, and maintenance activities for erection of electrical
    HV installations to ensure the safety of such systems.<br />\r\nIn the context
    of this document, \"safety\" relates to the safety of persons, domestic animals,
    livestock and property.<br />\r\nThis Technical Specification is intended for
    use by technical committees in the preparation of standards with safety aspects
    which can be a part of an electrical high voltage installation"
