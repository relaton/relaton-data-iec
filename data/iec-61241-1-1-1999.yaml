  content: "Is applicable to electrical apparatus protected by enclosures and surface
    temperature limitation for use in areas where combustible dust may be present
    in quantities which could lead to a fire or explosion hazard.  It specifies requirements
    for design, construction and testing of electrical apparatus.  \nNote - IEC 61241-2
    gives guidance on the selection, installation and maintenance of the apparatus.
    \ Apparatus within the scope of this standard may also be subject to additional
    requirements in other standards - for example, IEC 60079-0."
