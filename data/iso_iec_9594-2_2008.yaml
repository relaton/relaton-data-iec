abstract:
- content: "<p>The models defined in ISO/IEC 9594-2:2008 provide a conceptual and
    terminological framework for the other parts of ISO/IEC 9594, which define various
    aspects of the Directory.</p><p>The functional and administrative authority models
    define ways in which the Directory can be distributed, both functionally and administratively.
    Generic DSA and DSA information models and an Operational Framework are also provided
    to support Directory distribution.</p><p>The generic Directory Information Models
    describe the logical structure of the DIB from the perspective of Directory and
    Administrative Users. In these models, the fact that the Directory is distributed,
    rather than centralized, is not visible.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9594-2:2008 provides a
    specialization of the generic Directory Information Models to support Directory
    Schema administration.</p><p>Other parts of ISO/IEC 9594 make use of the concepts
    defined in ISO/IEC 9594-2:2008 to define specializations of the generic information
    and DSA models to provide specific information, DSA and operational models supporting
    particular directory capabilities (e.g. Replication):</p><ol><li>the service provided
    by the Directory is described (ISO/IEC 9594-3) in terms of the concepts of the
    information framework: this allows the service provided to be somewhat independent
    of the physical distribution of the DIB;</li><li>the distributed operation of
    the Directory is specified (ISO/IEC 9594-4) so as to provide that service, and
    therefore maintain that logical information structure, given that the DIB is in
    fact highly distributed;</li><li>replication capabilities offered by the component
    parts of the Directory to improve overall Directory performance are specified
    (ISO/IEC 9594-9).</li></ol><p>The security model establishes a framework for the
    specification of access control mechanisms. It provides a mechanism for identifying
    the access control scheme in effect in a particular portion of the DIT, and it
    defines three flexible, specific access control schemes which are suitable for
    a wide variety of applications and styles of use. The security model also provides
    a framework for protecting the confidentiality and integrity of directory operations
    using mechanisms such as encryption and digital signatures. This makes use of
    the framework for authentication defined in ISO/IEC 9594-8 as well as generic
    upper layers security tools defined in ISO/IEC 11586-1.</p><p>DSA models establish
    a framework for the specification of the operation of the components of the Directory.</p><p>Specifically:</p><ol><li>the
    Directory functional model describes how the Directory is manifested as a set
    of one or more components, each being a DSA;</li><li>the Directory distribution
    model describes the principals according to which the DIB entries and entry-copies
    may be distributed among DSAs;</li><li>the DSA information model describes the
    structure of the Directory user and operational information held in a DSA;</li><li>the
    DSA operational framework describes the means by which the definition of specific
    forms of cooperation between DSAs to achieve particular objectives (e.g. shadowing)
    is structured.</li></ol>"
