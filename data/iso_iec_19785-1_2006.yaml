abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19785-1:2006 defines a basic structure for standardized biometric
    information records (BIRs) within the Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework
    (CBEFF). This structure consists of three parts: the standard biometric header
    (SBH), the biometric data block (BDB), and the security block (SB). CBEFF also
    defines several data elements and their standardized abstract values that can
    be used in SBHs and SBs (CBEFF treats the BDB as opaque data). CBEFF also establishes
    mechanisms by which organizations, called ''patrons'' by CBEFF, can specify and
    publish BIR format specifications, which are in turn called ''patron formats''.
    CBEFF enables patrons to develop BIR specifications that are fully standardized
    and interoperable, yet are specifically adapted to the requirements of a particular
    application environment.CBEFF defines rules for BIRs that contain only one BDB
    (simple BIR) and that contain at least one BDB (complex BIR). CBEFF defines mandatory
    data elements that identify the format of a BDB and its security attributes (encryption
    and integrity). All the other CBEFF-defined data elements and abstract values
    are optional. CBEFF enables patrons to define additional data elements and abstract
    values as required by the application environment.'
