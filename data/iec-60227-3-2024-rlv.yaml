  content: "IEC 60227-3:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60227-3:2024
    details the particular standards for polyvinyl chloride insulated single-core
    non-sheathed cables for fixed wiring of rated voltages up to and including 450/750
    V. This document provides the particular requirements for non-sheathed cables
    for fixed wiring which apply in addition to the appropriate requirements specified
    in IEC 60227-1, which apply to all cables. The tests for cables specified in the
    IEC 60227 series are described in IEC 63294."
