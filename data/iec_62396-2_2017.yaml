abstract:
- content: IEC 62396-2:2017(E) aims to provide guidance related to the testing of
    electronic components for purposes of measuring their susceptibility to single
    event effects (SEE) induced by neutrons generated by cosmic ray interactions in
    the Earthâ€™s atmosphere (atmospheric neutrons). Since the testing can be performed
    in a number of different ways, using different kinds of radiation sources, it
    also shows how the test data can be used to estimate the SEE rate of electronic
    components and boards due to atmospheric neutrons at aircraft altitudes. Although
    developed for the avionics industry, this process can be applied by other industrial
    sectors.
