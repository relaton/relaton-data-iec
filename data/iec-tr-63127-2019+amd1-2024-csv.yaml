  content: IEC TR 63127:2019+AMD1:2024 CSV focuses on the system design of converter
    stations. It is applicable to point-­to-­point and back-to-back HVDC systems based
    on line-commutated converter (LCC) technology. This document provides guidance
    and supporting information on the procedure for system design and the technical
    issues involved in the system design of HVDC transmission projects for both purchaser
    and potential suppliers. It can be used as the basis for drafting a procurement
    specification and as a guide during project implementation.
