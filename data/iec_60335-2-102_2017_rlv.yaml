abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-102:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-102:2017
    deals with the safety of gas, oil and solid-fuel burning appliances having electrical
    connections, for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not
    more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances. This
    standard covers the electrical safety and some other safety aspects of these appliances.
    All safety aspects are covered when the appliance also complies with the relevant
    standard for the fuel-burning appliance. If the appliance incorporates electric
    heating sources, safety aspects concerning these electric sources are covered
    when the appliance also complies with the relevant part 2 of IEC 60335. Examples
    of appliances within the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n– central heating
    boilers;<br />\r\n– commercial catering equipment;<br />\r\n– cooking appliances;<br
    />\r\n– laundry and cleaning appliances;<br />\r\n– room heaters;<br />\r\n– warm
    air heaters;<br />\r\n– water heaters.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal
    household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and
    on farms, are within the scope of this standard. This standard deals with the
    reasonably foreseeable hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons. However, in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons
    (including children) whose<br />\r\n• physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or<br />\r\n• lack of experience and knowledge<br />\r\nprevents them from using
    the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements may be necessary;<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n–
    appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas). This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2004 including its
    Amendment 1 (2008) and its Amendment 2 (2012). This edition constitutes constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition: a spillage test is introduced for
    appliances that have a flat surface on which a cup may be placed (15.101); terms
    and definitions were renumbered and some notes have been converted to normative
    text or deleted (19.11.2, 22.103). This publication has been drafted in accordance
    with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2. This part 2-102 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established
    on the basis of IEC 60335-1:2010, its Amendment 1:2013 and its Amendment 2:2016.
    The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers
    and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication
    of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance
    with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised
    tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than
    36 months from the date of publication.<br /><br />\r\nKey words: Gas, Oil, Solid
    Fuel Burning Appliances, Safety"
