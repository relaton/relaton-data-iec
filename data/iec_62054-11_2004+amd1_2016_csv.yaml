abstract:
- content: "IEC 62054-11:2004+A1:2016(E) Specifies particular requirements for the
    type test of newly manufactured indoor electronic ripple control receivers for
    the reception and interpretation of pulses of a single audio frequency superimposed
    on the voltage of the electricity distribution network and for the execution of
    the corresponding switching operations. In this system the mains frequency is
    generally used to synchronize the transmitter and receivers. Neither the control
    frequency nor the encoding are standardized in this standard.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    publication is of high relevance for Smart Grid.<strong>This consolidated version
    consists of the first edition (2004) and its amendment 1 (2016). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>The contents
    of the corrigendum of March 2018 have been included in this copy."
