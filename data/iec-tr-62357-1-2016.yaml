  content: "IEC TR 62357-1:2016(E) provides a clear and comprehensive map of all standards
    which are contributing to support interactions, in an open and interoperable way,
    between actors, components and systems in the field of electricity grids from
    generation to consumers, including transmission and distribution. The document
    also brings the vision of the path which will be followed by the concerned IEC
    technical committees and working groups in the coming years, to improve the global
    efficiency, market relevancy and coverage of this series of standards. This second
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- it provides updates and defines layered Reference
    Architecture to help direct longer term goals and activities, specifically to
    ensure compatibility of all new standards developed in the IEC by benefitting
    from lessons learned during development of the current standards and their application
    to actual utility projects as well as through application of other internationally
    recognized architecture standards.<br />\r\n- It reflects the most recent editions
    of the IEC standards relating to power systems management and associated information
    exchange, including the IEC 61850 series and the IEC 61968, IEC 61970 and IEC
    62325 Common Information Model (CIM) standards."
