abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-33:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine the key control characteristic<br />\r\n• defect
    density (%, nm2)<br />\r\nof single layer graphene films by<br />\r\n• electron
    energy loss spectroscopy (EELS in transmission electron microscopy (TEM)).<br
    />\r\nThis document outlines a method for quantitative measurement of defects
    in graphene at the nanoscale.<br />\r\nThe method specified in this document is
    applicable to single layer graphene acquired via chemical vapour deposition (CVD),
    roll-to-roll production and exfoliated graphene flakes to estimate the defect
    density.<br />\r\nIn order to obtain reliable data, it is essential that the procedure
    is consistent for each specified condition from the preparation of the TEM specimen
    to its observation. It is essential to maintain the spatial resolution below 1
    nm by alignment of the beam. The dispersion value, which covers the entire energy
    loss near edge structure (ELNES) region of the carbon-K edge and maintains the
    highest energy resolution corresponds to 0,1 eV/ch. Defects in graphene are determined
    by measuring the spectral differences between sp2 hybridized and sp2/sp3 hybridized
    atoms, which are obtained by calculating the amplitude ratio of the π* and σ*
    orbital spectra."
