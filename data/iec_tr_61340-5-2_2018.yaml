abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 61340-5-2:2018, which has been developed to support IEC 61340-5-1,
    applies to activities that: manufacture, process, assemble, install, package,
    label, service, test, inspect, transport or otherwise handle electrical or electronic
    parts, assemblies and equipment with withstand voltages greater than or equal
    to 100 V HBM, 200 V CDM and 35 V for isolated conductors. Additional control elements
    or adjusted limits can be applicable for ESDS with lower withstand voltages. This
    second edition of IEC TR 61340-5-2 has been modified to provide guidance for users
    of IEC 61340-5-1:2016. The text has been arranged to follow the requirements of
    IEC 61340‑5‑1:2016 as closely as possible as well as providing specific guidance
    on each of the requirements of IEC 61340-5-1:2016.'
