- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC TR 61340-5-2:2018 is available as IEC TR 61340-5-2:2018
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC
    TR 61340-5-2:2018, which has been developed to support IEC 61340-5-1, applies
    to activities that: manufacture, process, assemble, install, package, label, service,
    test, inspect, transport or otherwise handle electrical or electronic parts, assemblies
    and equipment with withstand voltages greater than or equal to 100 V HBM, 200
    V CDM and 35 V for isolated conductors. Additional control elements or adjusted
    limits can be applicable for ESDS with lower withstand voltages. This second edition
    of IEC TR 61340-5-2 has been modified to provide guidance for users of IEC 61340-5-1:2016.
    The text has been arranged to follow the requirements of IEC 61340‑5‑1:2016 as
    closely as possible as well as providing specific guidance on each of the requirements
    of IEC 61340-5-1:2016."
