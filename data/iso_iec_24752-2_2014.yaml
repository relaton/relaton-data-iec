abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24752-2:2014 is a multi-part International Standard that aims to
    facilitate operation of information and electronic products through remote and
    alternative interfaces and intelligent agents. A user interface socket is an abstract
    user interface that describes the functionality and state of a device or service
    (target) in a machine-interpretable manner that is independent of presentation
    and input capabilities of a user interaction device. This part of ISO/IEC 24752
    defines an Extensible Markup Language (XML)-based language for describing a user
    interface socket. The purpose of the user interface socket is to expose the relevant
    information about a target so that a user can perceive its state and operate it.
    This includes data presented to the user, variables that can be manipulated by
    the user, commands that the user can activate, and exceptions that the user is
    notified about. The user interface socket specification is applicable to the construction
    and adaptation of user interfaces.
