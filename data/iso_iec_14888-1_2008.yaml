abstract:
- content: <p>There are two types of digital signature mechanism:</p><ul><li>When
    the verification process needs the message as part of the input, the mechanism
    is called "signature mechanism with appendix". A hash-function is in used in the
    calculation of the appendix.</li><li>When the verification process reveals all
    or part of the message, the mechanism is called a "signature mechanism giving
    message recovery". A hash-function is also used in the generation and verification
    of these signatures.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 14888 specifies digital signatures with
    appendix. ISO/IEC 14888-1:2008 specifies general principles and requirements for
    digital signatures with appendix. ISO/IEC 14888-2 addresses digital signatures
    based on integer factoring, and ISO/IEC 14888-3 addresses digital signatures based
    on discrete logarithm.</p><p>Signature mechanisms giving message recovery are
    specified in ISO/IEC 9796. Hash-functions are specified in ISO/IEC 10118.</p>
