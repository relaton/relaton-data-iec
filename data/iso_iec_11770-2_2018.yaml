abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11770-2:2018 This document defines key establishment mechanisms
    using symmetric cryptographic techniques.<br />\r\nThis document addresses three
    environments for the establishment of keys: Point-to-Point, Key Distribution Centre
    (KDC), and Key Translation Centre (KTC). It describes the required content of
    messages which carry keying material or are necessary to set up the conditions
    under which the keying material can be established.<br />\r\nThis document does
    not indicate other information which can be contained in the messages or specify
    other messages such as error messages. The explicit format of messages is not
    within the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify the
    means to be used to establish initial secret keys; that is, all the mechanisms
    specified in this document require an entity to share a secret key with at least
    one other entity (e.g. a TTP). For general guidance on the key lifecycle, see
    ISO/IEC 11770-1. This document does not explicitly address the issue of inter-domain
    key management. This document also does not define the implementation of key management
    mechanisms; products complying with this document are not necessarily compatible."
