abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines key establishment mechanisms using symmetric
    cryptographic techniques.</p><p>This document addresses three environments for
    the establishment of keys: Point-to-Point, Key Distribution Centre (KDC), and
    Key Translation Centre (KTC). It describes the required content of messages which
    carry keying material or are necessary to set up the conditions under which the
    keying material can be established.</p><p>This document does not indicate other
    information which can be contained in the messages or specify other messages such
    as error messages. The explicit format of messages is not within the scope of
    this document.</p><p>This document does not specify the means to be used to establish
    initial secret keys; that is, all the mechanisms specified in this document require
    an entity to share a secret key with at least one other entity (e.g. a TTP). For
    general guidance on the key lifecycle, see ISO/IEC 11770-1. This document does
    not explicitly address the issue of inter-domain key management. This document
    also does not define the implementation of key management mechanisms; products
    complying with this document are not necessarily compatible.</p>"
