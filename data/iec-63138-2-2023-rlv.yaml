  content: "IEC 63138-2:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 63138-2:2023,
    which is a sectional specification (SS), provides information and rules for the
    preparation of detail specifications (DS) for MQ4 series circular connectors with
    four RF channels, as well as a detailed specification of the blank format. An
    MQ4 series circular connector with 50 Ω nominal impedance has four RF channels
    which can be engaged and disengaged at the same time. There are two versions of
    plug connectors, one is a quick-lock version, and the other is a threaded version.
    The socket connector provides two coupling mechanisms, a quick-lock and a threaded
    coupling. MQ4 series circular connectors can be used in mobile communication systems
    and in other communication equipment. This document also specifies the mating
    face dimensions and gauging information of MQ4 series circular connectors, and
    tests selected from IEC 63138-1, applicable to all detail specifications relating
    to MQ4 series circular connectors."
