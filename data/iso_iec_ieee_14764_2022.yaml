abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 14764:2022 This document provides guidance for the maintenance
    of software, based on the maintenance process and its activities and tasks defined
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.13. Moreover, this document describes the maintenance
    process in greater detail and establishes definitions for the various types of
    maintenance. This includes maintenance for multiple software products with the
    same maintenance resources. “Maintenance” in this document means software maintenance
    unless otherwise stated.<br />\r\nThe document does not address the operation
    of software and the operational functions, e.g. backup, recovery, system administration,
    which are normally performed by those who operate the software. However, it does
    include the related disposal process defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017, 6.4.14.<br
    />\r\nThis document is written primarily for managers, maintenance organizations,
    quality managers, users and acquirers of systems containing software.<br />\r\nMany
    of the activities and tasks discussed in this document apply equally to maintenance
    services, as well as to maintained software products. For example, in a COTS intensive
    system, maintenance services are performed to sustain the product in operations.<br
    />\r\nWhile the scope of this document is software maintenance, hardware and hardware
    costs are important considerations for maintenance."
