    <p>This International Standard specifies the Supplementary Service (SS) Single Step Call Transfer (SSCT), which is applicable to</p>
    <p>various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC</p>
    <p>11574.</p>
    <p>SS-SSCT is a supplementary service that enables an SSCT user, user A, to transform an existing call between user A and user</p>
    <p>B into a new call between user B and a user C whereby user A does not have a call established with user C prior to call</p>
    <p>transfer.</p>
    <p>Supplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This</p>
    <p>International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-SSCT. The stage 1 specification (clause 6)</p>
    <p>specifies the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the Functional Entities</p>
    <p>involved in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>
