abstract:
- content: IEC 62495:2011(E) is applicable to the radiological safety of portable
    handheld X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis equipment utilizing a miniature X-ray
    tube as the source of ionizing radiation for industrial applications. Establishes
    performance specifications for general radiation, electrical, safety and environmental
    characteristics of the design and operation, and test methods in relation to radiological
    safety for portable XRF analysis equipment utilizing a miniature X-ray tube. The
    proposed performance specifications are aimed at minimizing and avoiding the health
    risk associated with the use of these devices.
