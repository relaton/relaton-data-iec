    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61340-4-6:2025
    provides electrical and mechanical test methods and performance limits for the
    evaluation, acceptance, and periodic verification testing of wrist straps. This
    document is intended for testing wrist straps and wrist strap systems used for
    the grounding of personnel engaged in working with ESD sensitive assemblies and
    devices. It does not address constant monitoring systems.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) editorial comments made during the review of the second edition
    were reviewed and incorporated where appropriate;<br />\r\nb) normative references
