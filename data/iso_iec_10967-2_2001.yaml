abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    part of ISO/IEC 10967 de_nes the properties of numerical approximations for many
    of the real elementary numerical functions available in standard libraries for
    a variety of programming languages in common use for mathematical and numerical
    applications.<br />\r\nAn implementor may choose any combination of hardware and
    software support to meet the specications of this part. It is the computing environment,
    as seen by the programmer/user, that does or does not conform to the specications.<br
    />\r\nThe term implementation (of this part) denotes the total computing environment
    pertinent to this part, including hardware, language processors, subroutine libraries,
    exception handling facilities, other software, and documentation."
