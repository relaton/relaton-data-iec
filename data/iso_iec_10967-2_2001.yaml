abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 10967 de_nes the properties of numerical approximations
    for many of the</p><p>real elementary numerical functions available in standard
    libraries for a variety of programming</p><p>languages in common use for mathematical
    and numerical applications.</p><p>An implementor may choose any combination of
    hardware and software support to meet the</p><p>speci_cations of this part. It
    is the computing environment, as seen by the programmer/user, that</p><p>does
    or does not conform to the speci_cations.</p><p>The term implementation (of this
    part) denotes the total computing environment pertinent</p><p>to this part, including
    hardware, language processors, subroutine libraries, exception handling</p><p>facilities,
    other software, and documentation.</p>"
