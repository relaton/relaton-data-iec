    <p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-5:2016 defines an efficient and consistent solution for Keyword-Driven Testing by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>      giving an introduction to Keyword-Driven Testing;</li>
    <li>      providing a reference approach to implement Keyword-Driven Testing;</li>
    <li>      defining requirements on frameworks for Keyword-Driven Testing to enable testers to share their work items, such as test cases, test data, keywords, or complete test specifications;</li>
    <li>      defining requirements for tools that support Keyword-Driven Testing. These requirements could apply to any tool that supports the Keyword-Driven approach (e.g., test automation, test design and test management tools);</li>
    <li>      defining interfaces and a common data exchange format to ensure that tools from different vendors can exchange their data (e.g. test cases, test data and test results);</li>
    <li>      defining levels of hierarchical keywords, and advising use of hierarchical keywords. This includes describing specific types of keywords (e.g. keywords for navigation or for checking  a value) and when to use "flat" structured keywords;</li>
    <li>      providing an initial list of example generic technical (low-level) keywords, such as "inputData" or "checkValue". These keywords can be used to specify test cases on a technical level, and may be combined to create business-level keywords as required.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>NOTE          This standard is applicable to all those who want to create keyword-driven test specifications, create corresponding frameworks, or build test automation based on keywords.</p>
