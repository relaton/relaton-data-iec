  content: <p>Specifies a set of functions which an SGML syntax-directed editing system
    may have in order to help users manipulate documents. Contains two major clauses.
    The first one describes the functions on an SGML syntax-directed editing system
    as applied to document processing. The second clause identifies those additional
    facilities felt to be appropriate for DTD processing. Does not specify a "standard
    editing system". Is primarily aimed at the creator of "text" documents. Although
    SGML can be used, for instance, for databases, spreadsheets, mathematics, and
    even music, these uses are not directly considered.</p>
