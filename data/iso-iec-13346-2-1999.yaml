    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format and associated system requirements for volume and boot block</p>
    <p>recognition by specifying:</p>
    <p>  volume recognition;</p>
    <p>  boot descriptors intended for use to bring a system to a known state;</p>
    <p>  levels of medium interchange;</p>
    <p>  requirements for the processes which are provided within information processing systems, to enable</p>
    <p>information to be interchanged between different systems; for this purpose, this part of ISO/IEC 13346 specifies</p>
    <p>the functions to be provided within systems which are intended to originate or receive media which conform to</p>
    <p>this part of ISO/IEC 13346.</p>
