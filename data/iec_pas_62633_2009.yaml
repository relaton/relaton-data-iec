    IEC/PAS 62633:2009(E) contains an additional profile - SNpTYPE - which may be integrated into a future new edition of IEC 61784-2. IEC 61784 specifies:<br />
    - performance indicators supporting classification schemes for Real-Time Ethernet (RTE) requirements;<br />
    - profiles and related network components based on ISO/IEC 8802-3, IEC 61158 series, and IEC 61784-1;<br />
    - RTE solutions that are able to run in parallel with ISO/IEC 8802-3-based applications.
