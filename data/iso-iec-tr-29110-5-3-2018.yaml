    1.1  Fields of application  <p>These Service Delivery guidelines are applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). A VSE is an enterprise, an organization, a department or a project having up to 25 people.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 provides guidance to manage a set of services delivered to customers. The VSE can act as an internal service provider (providing services internal to the VSE) or as an external service provider (providing services commercially to external customers). These lifecycle processes (Governance, Service Control, Service Relationship and Service Incident) support and enhance the activities of software and system operations (further to development and installation) to create effective and efficient products and services.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 provides guidance for Service Delivery. This document, when implemented, will assist and guide the VSE in the delivery of services which can benefit customers. This document does not promote uniformity in approach across all organizations as specific objectives and initiatives are tailored to suit an individual organization's needs.</p>
    <p>Tasks described in this guideline document (and therefore activities and processes) are related by input/output relationships which imply a logical execution sequence. The order of presentation of the processes or the associated numbering scheme is for identification purposes only, NOT to indicate implementation or execution order. As every VSE is different; tasks can be implemented in an order that is suitable for the organization, while respecting the relationships between tasks.</p>
    1.2  Target audience  <p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 is intended to be used by VSEs to establish processes to implement effective and efficient service delivery. This service delivery guidelines document can be used by VSEs that are offering only services to its customers or it can be combined with the information from ISO/IEC 29110 systems and/or software management and engineering guidelines.</p>
