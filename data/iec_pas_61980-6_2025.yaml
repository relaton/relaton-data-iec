abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 61980-6:2025 addresses communication and activities of magnetic
    field dynamic wireless power transfer (MF-D-WPT) systems. The power transfer takes
    place while the electric vehicle (EV) is in motion.<br />\r\nThe requirements
    in this document are intended to be applied for MF-D-WPT systems according to
    IEC PAS 61980-5 and ISO 5474-6.<br />\r\nSupply device fulfilling the requirements
    in this document are intended to operate with EV devices fulfilling the requirements
    described in ISO 5474-6.<br />\r\nThe aspects covered in this document include:<br
    />\r\n– operational and functional characteristics of the MF-D-WPT communication
    system and related activities<br />\r\n– operational and functional characteristics
    of the positioning system<br />\r\nThe following aspects are under consideration
    for future documents:<br />\r\n– requirements for two- and three-wheel vehicles,<br
    />\r\n– requirements for bidirectional power transfer"
