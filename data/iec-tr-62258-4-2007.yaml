  content: This technical report has been developed to facilitate the production,
    supply and use of semiconductor die products, including wafers; singulated bare
    die; die and wafers with attached connection structures; minimally or partially
    encapsulated die and wafers. This report contains a questionnaire, based on the
    requirements of other parts of IEC 62258, which may be used in negotiations and
    contracts between suppliers and purchasers of die devices. It is intended to assist
    all those involved in the supply chain for die devices to comply with the requirements
    of the IEC 62258-1 and IEC 62258-2 standards.
