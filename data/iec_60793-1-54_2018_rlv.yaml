abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-54:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-54:2018
    outlines a method for measuring the steady state response of optical fibres and
    optical cables exposed to gamma radiation. It can be employed to determine the
    level of radiation-induced attenuation produced in Class B single-mode or Class
    A, category A1 and A2 multimode optical fibres, in either cabled or uncabled form,
    due to exposure to gamma radiation. The attenuation of cabled and uncabled optical
    fibres generally increases when exposed to gamma radiation. This is primarily
    due to the trapping of radiolytic electrons and holes at defect sites in the glass
    (i.e. the formation of \"colour centres\"). This test procedure focuses on two
    regimes of interest: the low dose rate regime suitable for estimating the effect
    of environmental background radiation, and the high dose rate regime suitable
    for estimating the effect of adverse nuclear environments. The testing of the
    effects of environmental background radiation is achieved with an attenuation
    measurement approach similar to IEC 60793-1-40 method A, cut-back. The effects
    of adverse nuclear environments are tested by monitoring the power before, during
    and after exposure of the test sample to gamma radiation. The depopulation of
    colour centres by light (photo bleaching) or by heat causes recovery (lessening
    of radiation induced attenuation). Recovery can occur over a wide range of time
    which depends on the irradiation time and annealing temperature. This complicates
    the characterization of radiation induced attenuation since the attenuation depends
    on many variables including the temperature of the test environment, the configuration
    of the sample, the total dose and the dose rate applied to the sample and the
    light level used to measure it. This test is not a material test for the non-optical
    material components of a fibre optic cable. If degradation of cable materials
    exposed to irradiation is studied, other test methods will be used. This test
    method is written to contain a clear, concise listing of instructions. The background
    knowledge that is necessary to perform correct, relevant and expressive irradiation
    tests as well as to limit measurement uncertainty is presented separately in IEC
    TR 62283. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- test conditions related to photobleaching have been changed;<br />\r\n-
    the test length has been modified to yield a total induced attenuation in the
    test sample at the end of the irradiation between 3 dB and 10 dB."
