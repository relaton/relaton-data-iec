abstract:
- content: Is the first part in a series of standards that define interfaces for the
    major elements of an interface architecture for Distribution Management Systems.
    Identifies and establishes requirements for standard interfaces based on an Interface
    Reference Model. This set of standards is limited to the definition of interfaces
    and is implementation independent; it provides for interoperability among different
    computer systems, platforms, and languages.<br /><br />This publication is of
    core relevance for Smart Grid.
