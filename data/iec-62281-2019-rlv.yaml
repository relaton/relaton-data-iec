  content: "IEC 62281:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62281:2019
    specifies test methods and requirements for primary and secondary (rechargeable)
    lithium cells and batteries to ensure their safety during transport other than
    for recycling or disposal. Requirements specified in this document do not apply
    in those cases where special provisions given in the relevant regulations, listed
    in 7.3, provide exemptions. NOTE Different standards may apply for lithium-ion
    traction battery systems used for electrically propelled road vehicles. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2016. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) button cell
    definition revised, moved to coin (cell or battery);<br />\r\nb) addition of provisions
    for batteries forming an integral part of equipment (5.4);<br />\r\nc) all tests
    for secondary cells and batteries now also contain a requirement for 25 charge
    and recharge cycles prior to the test;<br />\r\nd) addition of alternative tables
    for Table 1 and Table 2 in Annex B;<br />\r\ne) addition of \"forcible\" to the
    rupture criteria;<br />\r\nf) test report 6.8 merged with test certificate 6.9
    and replaced with the items listed in [13];<br />\r\ng) addition of an informative
    Annex B with important deviations from the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, Chapter
    38.3.<br />\r\nKeywords: transport of primary lithium cells and batteries"
