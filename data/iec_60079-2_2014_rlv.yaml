abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-2:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-2:2014 contains
    the specific requirements for the construction and testing of electrical equipment
    with pressurized enclosures, of type of protection \"p\", intended for use in
    explosive gas atmospheres or explosive dust atmospheres. It also includes the
    requirements for pressurized enclosures containing a limited release of a flammable
    substance. This standard supplements and modifies the general requirements of
    IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement of this standard conflicts with a requirement
    of IEC 60079-0, the requirements of this standard take precedence. This standard
    does not include the requirements for:<br />\r\n- pressurized enclosures where
    the containment system may release air with an oxygen content greater than normal,
    or oxygen in combination with inert gas where the oxygen is in a proportion greater
    than 21 %;<br />\r\n- pressurized rooms or analyser houses; see IEC 60079-13;<br
    />\r\n- pressurized enclosures used where \"explosives\" or pyrotechnics are present;<br
    />\r\n- pressurized enclosures used where hybrid mixtures of gas/vapour and combustible
    dust are present;<br />\r\n- pressurized enclosures used where pyrophoric substances
    such as explosives or propellants containing their own oxidizers are present;<br
    />\r\n- pressurized enclosures with an internal source of release of combustible
    dust.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published
    in 2007. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61241-4
    published in 2001. This sixth edition constitutes a technical revision. The significance
    of changes between IEC 60079-2, Edition 6.0, 2014 and IEC 60079-2, Edition 5.0,
    2007 are as listed in the foreword of the document.<br />\r\nKeywords: electrical
    equipment with pressurized enclosures, type of protection \"p\", explosive gas
    atmospheres, explosive dust atmospheres<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of July 2015 have been included in this copy."
