abstract:
- content: "CISPR TR 18-2:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nCISPR TR 18-2:2017
    which is a Technical Report, applies to radio noise from overhead power lines
    and high-voltage equipment which may cause interference to radio reception. The
    frequency range covered by this publication is 0,15 MHz to 3 GHz. A general procedure
    for establishing the limits of the radio noise field from the power lines and
    equipment is recommended, together with typical values as examples, and methods
    of measurement. The clause on limits concentrates on the low frequency and medium
    frequency bands and it is only in these bands where ample evidence, based on established
    practice, is available. No examples of limits to protect radio reception in the
    frequency band 30 MHz to 3 GHz have been given, as measuring methods and certain
    other aspects of the problems in this band have not yet been fully resolved. Site
    measurements and service experience have shown that levels of noise from power
    lines at frequencies higher than 300 MHz in normal operation are so low that interference
    is unlikely to be caused to television reception. The values of limits given as
    examples are calculated to provide a reasonable degree of protection to the reception
    of broadcasting at the boundary of the recognized service areas of the appropriate
    transmitters in the radio frequency bands used for a.m. radio broadcasting, in
    the least favourable conditions likely to be generally encountered. These limits
    are intended to provide guidance at the planning stage of the line and national
    standards or other specifications against which the performance of the line may
    be checked after construction and during its useful life. The measuring apparatus
    and methods used for checking compliance with limits should comply with the respective
    CISPR specifications, as e.g. the basic standards series CISPR 16, see [1]. This
    third edition of CISPR TR 18-2 is adapted to the modern structure and content
    of technical reports issued by IEC. The second edition of CISPR TR 18-2 underwent
    thorough edition and adaptation to modern terminology. This third edition now
    also covers an adequate method of measurement for radiated disturbances from HV
    overhead power lines and substations in the range 300 MHz to 3 GHz, since gap-type
    discharges can be a potential noise source disturbing modern digital radio communication.<br
