abstract:
- content: Within the general scope described in part 1 of ISO/IEC 9995 this part
    of ISO/IEC 9995 specifies the numeric section of a keyboard and the division of
    that section into zones. It specifies the arrangement, the number, and the location
    of the keys in the numeric zone ZN0 and in the function zones ZN1 to ZN6 of the
    numeric section, as well as the allocation of functions to the keys.The numeric
    zone ZN0 is to be used in keyboards for applications such as text and data processing;
    general office environment; banking; point of sales (POS); telematic services;
    telephony apparatus; home electronic systems; numerical control of machinery and
    equipment; input of personal identification number (PIN); etc.The function zones
    ZN1 to ZN6 are to be used in keyboards for applications such as data entry, text
    and data processing, general office environment, etc. NOTE Certain of these applications
    are under the responsibility of the ITU-T.
