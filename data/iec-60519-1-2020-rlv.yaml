  content: "IEC 60519-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60519-1:2020
    specifies the general safety requirements for industrial installations or equipment
    intended for electroheating (EH) and electroheating based treatment technologies
    as well as for electromagnetic processing of materials (EPM). This document deals
    with the significant hazards, hazardous situations or hazardous events relevant
    to industrial EH and EPM equipment, as listed in Annex A, for normal operation
    and for single fault condition as well as under conditions of reasonably foreseeable
    misuse. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in
    2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- removal of noise from the scope;<br />\r\n- clarification of EMC requirements;<br
    />\r\n- risk classification of hazards based on emission for all processing frequencies;<br
    />\r\n- clarification of boundaries between IEC 60519 (all parts) and ISO 13577
    (all parts)."
