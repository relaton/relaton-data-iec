    use of generic balanced cabling for customer premises, as specified in the ISO/IEC
    11801 series, for remote powering of terminal equipment. It provides guidance
    on new cabling installations and renovations. The customer premises may encompass
    one of more buildings or may be within a building that contains more than one
    organization. The cabling may be installed prior to the selection of remote powering
    equipment or powered terminal equipment.
