abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29173-1:2012 defines an interface protocol between a device driver
    of a mobile AIDC application platform and a mobile RFID interrogator within a
    mobile AIDC terminal. It is intended that ISO/IEC 29173-1:2012 be implemented
    in both the device driver of a mobile AIDC application platform and the mobile
    RFID interrogator.<br /><br />\r\nWithout this standard protocol, manufacturers
    of mobile RFID interrogators would likely develop multiple mobile RFID interrogator
    device drivers for different mobile AIDC application platforms. Moreover, they
    also would likely develop a proprietary interface protocol between the mobile
    AIDC application platform and the mobile RFID interrogator. On the other hand,
    if both the mobile AIDC application platform and the Mobile RFID interrogator
    developers follow this standardized mobile RFID interrogator device protocol,
    various independent products will be mutually interoperable without extra costs.<br
    /><br />\r\nIn accordance with the ISO/IEC 18000-63 type C RFID air interface,
    ISO/IEC 29173-1:2012 includes:<br />\r\n\t types of command/response/notification
    protocol messages and their usages,<br />\r\n\t protocol message format, and<br
    />\r\n\t protocol message exchange procedures.<br /><br /><br />"
