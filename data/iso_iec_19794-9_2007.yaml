abstract:
- content: "This edition of the standard exceptionally remains valid until 2025.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 defines the exchange of human vascular biometric
    image information. It defines a specific definition of attributes, a data record
    format for storing and transmitting vascular biometric images and certain attributes,
    a sample record and conformance criteria.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 19794-9:2007
    is intended for applications requiring the exchange of raw or processed vascular
    biometric images. It is intended for applications not limited by the amount of
    storage required. It is a compromise or a trade-off between the resources required
    for data storage or transmission and the potential for improved data quality/accuracy.
    Basically, it is to enable various algorithms to identify or verify the vascular
    biometric image data transferred from other image sources. Currently available
    vascular biometric technologies that may utilize ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 for image
    exchange are technologies that use the back of the hand, palm and finger."
