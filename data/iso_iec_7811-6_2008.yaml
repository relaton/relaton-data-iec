abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 7811 defines the characteristics of identification cards. ISO/IEC
    7811-6:2008 provides criteria to which cards shall perform and specifies the requirements
    for such cards used for international interchange. It takes into consideration
    both human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.ISO/IEC 7811-6:2008
    specifies requirements for a high coercivity magnetic stripe (including any protective
    overlay) on an identification card, the encoding technique and coded character
    sets. It includes a modified algorithm for waveform measurement which produces
    more consistent results (incorporated from ISO/IEC 7811-6:2001/Amd.1:2005), and
    an additional requirement has been added for signal amplitude.ISO/IEC 7811-6:2008
    specifies the following:the conditions for conformance;physical characteristics
    for the card (warpage and surface distortions) and the magnetic stripe area (location,
    height and surface profile, roughness, adhesion, wear, and resistance to chemicals);the
    signal amplitude performance characteristics of the magnetic stripe;the encoding
    specification including technique (F2F), angle of recording, bit density, flux
    transition spacing variation, and signal amplitude;the data structure including
    track format, the use of error correction techniques;the location of encoded tracks.ISO/IEC
    7811-6:2008, together with a standard for test methods, provides for interchange
    between various types of identification card processing devices and systems.
