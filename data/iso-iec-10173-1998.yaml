    <p>This International Standard specifies the 8-contact connector (plug and jack) and the assignments of its contact</p>
    <p>numbers for use in the physical interfaces of Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) primary rate access</p>
    <p>services conforming to ITU-T Recommendation I.431.</p>
    <p>In this International Standard, as in ITU-T Recommendation I.431, the term "NT" is used to indicate the network</p>
    <p>terminating layer 1 aspects of NT1s and NT2s, and the term "TE" is used to indicate terminal layer 1 aspects of</p>
    <p>TE1s, TAs and NT2s.</p>
    <p>NOTES</p>
    <p>1 This International Standard specifies only those connector dimensions required to ensure intermatability of plug and</p>
    <p>jack. Complete detailed specifications of the connector are the subject of IEC 603-7, see annex C.</p>
    <p>2 ITU-T recognizes an alternative connection system which is not covered by this International Standard. It uses</p>
    <p>coaxial connectors as specified in IEC 169-8 (see annex C), and is illustrated in annex B.</p>
