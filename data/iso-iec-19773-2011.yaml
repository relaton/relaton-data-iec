  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19773:2011 specifies small modules of data that can be used
    or reused in applications. These modules have been extracted from ISO/IEC 11179-3,
    ISO/IEC 19763, and OASIS EBXML, and have been refined further. These modules are
    intended to harmonize with current and future versions of the ISO/IEC 11179 series
    and the ISO/IEC 19763 series. These modules include: reference-or-literal (reflit)
    for on-demand choices of pointers or data; multitext, multistring, etc. for recording
    internationalized and localized data within the same structure; slots and slot
    arrays for standardized extensible data structures; internationalized contact
    data, including UPU postal addresses, ITU-T E.164 phone numbers, internet E-mail
    addresses, etc.; generalized model for context data based upon who-what-where-when-why-how
    (W5H); data structures for reified relationships and entity-person-groups. Conformity
    can be selected on a per-module basis.</p>"
