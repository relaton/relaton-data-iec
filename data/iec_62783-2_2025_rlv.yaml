abstract:
- content: "IEC 62783-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62783-2:2025
    specifies the definitions and requirements of twin-axial (twinax) cables used
    in digital communication systems. This document covers twinax cable intended to
    be used indoors. The specifications are intended to support the twinax link segment
    specifications of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3 Ethernet over twinax physical layer
    (PHY) specifications. This document gives requirements and transmission characteristics
    for a single twinax element as well as for multiple twinax elements within the
    same sheath, i.e. \"twinax cable\". This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) updating according to the revised generic
    twinax cable requirements given in IEC 62783 1:2023;<br />\r\nb) updating according
    to new twinax link segment specifications recently added to ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3
    Ethernet physical interfaces."
