abstract:
- content: "This document is a specialization of the more general reference model
    for software and systems product line engineering and management described in
    ISO/IEC 26550. The specialization defined herein addresses a class of methods
    and tools referred to as feature-based software and systems product line engineering,
    or feature-based PLE, which has emerged as a proven and repeatable product line
    engineering and management (PLE) practice supported by commercial tool providers.<br
    />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n- provides the terms and definitions specific to
    feature-based PLE;<br />\r\n- defines how feature-based PLE is a specialization
    within the general ISO/IEC 26550 reference model for product line engineering
    and management;<br />\r\n- defines a reference model for the overall structure
    and processes of feature-based PLE and describes how the elements of the reference
    model fit together;<br />\r\n- defines interrelationships and methods for applying
    the elements and tools of the product line reference model;<br />\r\n- defines
    required and supporting tool capabilities.<br />\r\nIn this document, products
    of feature-based PLE include digital work products that support the engineering
    of a system. Some of the artefacts are actually part of the delivered products,
    while other artefacts can be non-deliverable, such as physical or digital design
    models.<br />\r\nThe intended audience for this document comprises:<br />\r\n-
    technology providers who wish to provide automated tool support for the reference
    model and processes described in this document;<br />\r\n- champions within an
    organization who wish to introduce feature-based PLE throughout that organization;<br
    />\r\n- IT staff within a PLE organization who will introduce and maintain the
    necessary technology to support feature-based PLE;<br />\r\n- practitioner stakeholders
    who will use the provided technology to practice feature-based PLE;<br />\r\n-
    technical and business managers who will sponsor and direct the methods necessary
    to practice feature-based PLE;<br />\r\n- university professors, researchers,
    corporate trainers, and other educators who will create and share pedagogical
    materials about feature-based PLE and its benefits."
