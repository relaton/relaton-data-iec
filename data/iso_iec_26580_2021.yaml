abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a specialization of the more general reference model
    for software and systems product line engineering and management described in
    ISO/IEC 26550. The specialization defined herein addresses a class of methods
    and tools referred to as feature-based software and systems product line engineering,
    or feature-based PLE, which has emerged as a proven and repeatable product line
    engineering and management (PLE) practice supported by commercial tool providers.</p><p>This
    document:</p><p>— provides the terms and definitions specific to feature-based
    PLE;</p><p>— defines how feature-based PLE is a specialization within the general
    ISO/IEC 26550 reference model for product line engineering and management;</p><p>—
    defines a reference model for the overall structure and processes of feature-based
    PLE and describes how the elements of the reference model fit together;</p><p>—
    defines interrelationships and methods for applying the elements and tools of
    the product line reference model;</p><p>— defines required and supporting tool
    capabilities.</p><p>In this document, products of feature-based PLE include digital
    work products that support the engineering of a system. Some of the artefacts
    are actually part of the delivered products, while other artefacts can be non-deliverable,
    such as physical or digital design models.</p><p>The intended audience for this
    document comprises:</p><p>— technology providers who wish to provide automated
    tool support for the reference model and processes described in this document;</p><p>—
    champions within an organization who wish to introduce feature-based PLE throughout
    that organization;</p><p>— IT staff within a PLE organization who will introduce
    and maintain the necessary technology to support feature-based PLE;</p><p>— practitioner
    stakeholders who will use the provided technology to practice feature-based PLE;</p><p>—
    technical and business managers who will sponsor and direct the methods necessary
    to practice feature-based PLE;</p><p>— university professors, researchers, corporate
    trainers, and other educators who will create and share pedagogical materials
    about feature-based PLE and its benefits.</p>"
