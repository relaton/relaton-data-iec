abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-354:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60092-354:2020
    is applicable to shipboard and offshore power cables with extruded solid insulation,
    conductor and core screening, having a voltage rating of one of the following:
    3,6/6 (7,2) kV,6/10 (12) kV, 8,7/15 (17,5) kV, 12/20 (24) kV, 18/30 (36) kV. The
    cables are intended for fixed installations. The various types of power cables
    are given in 5.1. The constructional requirements and test methods are aligned
    with those indicated in IEC 60092-350, unless otherwise specified in this document.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is:<br />\r\n- to standardize cables whose safety
    and reliability is ensured when they are installed in accordance with the requirements
    of IEC 60092-352 or IEC 61892-4;<br />\r\n- to lay down standard manufacturing
    requirements and characteristics of such cables directly or indirectly bearing
    on safety;<br />\r\n- to specify test methods for checking conformity with those
    requirements.<br />\r\nOnly radial field cables are covered. This fourth edition
    cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision."
