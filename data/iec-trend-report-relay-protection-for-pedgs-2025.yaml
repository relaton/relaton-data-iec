  content: "The global energy transition is ushering in a new era of power electronic-dominated
    grids (PEDGs), to complement the increase in the widespread integration of renewable
    sources like wind and solar. It is reshaping traditional grid architecture and
    making way for more flexible, efficient and sustainable systems. However, this
    transformation introduces significant challenges to grid stability, especially
    for relay protection technologies. Traditional relay protection often falls ineffective
    in power-electronics dominated grids, increasing the risk of mis-operation or
    operation failure and compromising grid stability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRecognizing
    the dire need for advanced relay protection, this report presents a comprehensive
    analysis of the evolving landscape. It outlines technical challenges, potential
    innovative solutions, equipment development trends, emerging market opportunities
    and new business models in the field. It highlights the urgent need for a paradigm
    shift in protection strategies to counter technical constraints, outdated standards,
    and deal with the rise of distributed generation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report
    calls for strategic standardization efforts, including updates to IEC 61850 and
    the development of verification standards for AI-based protection. It concludes
    its findings with a set of recommendations and stresses international collaboration
    to drive shared innovation and broaden global market access.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    IEC societal and technology trend report was developed by the Societal and Technology
    Trend Working Group (STTWG) in the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available
