    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62391-1:2015(E) applies
    to fixed electric double-layer capacitors (hereafter referred to as capacitor(s))
    mainly used in d.c. circuits of electric and electronic equipment. This part of
    IEC 62391 establishes standard terms, inspection procedures and methods of test
    for use in sectional and detail specifications of electronic components for quality
    assessment or any other purpose. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) enhancement
    of the scope to include electric (high power) application;<br />\r\nb) implementation
    of Annex Q, replacing Clause 3 in the first edition;<br />\r\nc) in addition,
    minor revisions related to tables, figures and references.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigenda of December 2016 and of June 2019 have been included in this
