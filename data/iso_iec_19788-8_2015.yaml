abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19788-8:2015 provides data elements for the description of MLR
    records: sets of data elements describing a learning resource [and resources directly
    related to that learning resource, e.g. persons (authors, contributors), annotations,
    learning activities, metadata records, etc.]. It can also be used to keep track
    of the record editing process including global metadata author identification,
    last record update, and application profile used for the description of a learning
    resource.<p>These elements can later be combined with other descriptive elements
    from other parts of ISO/IEC 19788 or other standards to provide the description
    of a learning resource and of related entities needed for that description.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19788-8:2015 enables the storage of learning resource description in the traditional
    database approach and the exchange of descriptions through harvesting mechanisms.</p>'
