    <p>ISO/IEC 19778:2015 specifies a table-based approach for defining Data Models. This Data Model specification is used for specifying the collaborative workplace Data Model. The same Data Model specification is also used in ISO/IEC 19778‑2 and ISO/IEC 19778‑3 to define the related components of the collaborative environment (ISO/IEC 19778‑2) and the collaborative group (ISO/IEC 19778‑3) in separate Data Models.</p>
    <p>The collaborative workplace Data Model specifies the Data Model Elements and their interrelationships that enable the creation of collaborative workplace Data Model instantiations.</p>
    <p>Any conforming collaborative workplace Data Model instantiation describes or specifies a particular collaborative workplace with which it is associated.</p>
