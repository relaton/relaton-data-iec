abstract:
- content: "The scope of this document is limited to the evaluation of black ink cartridge
    page yield for ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink
    cartridges without integrated printheads) for monochrome inkjet print systems.
    This document can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional
    device that has a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices
    that contain inkjet printer components. Both liquid and solid ink products can
    be tested using this document.<br />\r\nThis document is only intended for the
    measurement of ink cartridge page yield when printing on plain paper. No other
    claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.<br />\r\nThis
    document can be used to measure the yield of any cartridge that is used in a significant
    amount during the printing of the test page defined in ISO/IEC 19752.<br />\r\nThis
    document is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to
    or greater than A3 or for printers designed or configured to print photos (for
    example, maximum printable size less than A4 or a printer configuration intended
    for photo only printing). In addition, this document only applies to drop on demand
    printing systems.<br />\r\nNOTE Integrated ink cartridge is a cartridge that includes
    at least: an ink containment part, an ink deposition mechanism and an ink transport
    part (see ISO/IEC 29142-1)."
