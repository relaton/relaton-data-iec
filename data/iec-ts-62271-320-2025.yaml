  content: IEC TS 62271-320:2025 provides guidance to suppliers, manufacturers, users,
    and waste operators of high-voltage switchgear and controlgear as well as their
    assemblies having a rated voltage above 1 kV AC and 1,5 kV DC, together with their
    associated auxiliary equipment, on environmentally conscious design, and on assessing
    environmental impacts when used in systems. This document also gives guidance
    on effective communication of environmental information throughout the entire
    life cycle.
