  content: "IEC 60335-2-120:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 60335-2-120:2024 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 603352-120:2024 deals with the
    safety of appliances for generation of directly inhalable aerosols, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances, and other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nExamples of the appliances that are within the scope of this standard are:<br
    />\r\n- vapour and aerosol appliances;<br />\r\n- personal vaping appliances with
    or without nicotine;<br />\r\n- electronic cigarettes;<br />\r\n- electronic nicotine
    delivery systems (ENDS);<br />\r\n- electronic non-nicotine delivery systems (ENNDS);<br
    />\r\n- electronic tobacco heating appliances for heated tobacco products.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- medical ventilators,<br />\r\n-
    humidifiers (IEC 60335-2-98).<br />\r\nThese requirements do not cover the consumables,
    such as e-liquids and other inhaled aerosol substances, wicks, and other particulate
    matter inhaled during use, nor do they cover substances in the emissions from
    the operation of the appliances. For example, heavy metal emissions in the aerosol
    and environmental exposure are not covered by this standard. These requirements
    do not consider the physiological effects of any consumable used with the appliances.
    This International Standard does not cover requirements or prohibitions of the
    labelling, packaging and contents of nicotine-containing or nicotine-consuming
    products that are strictly regulated by law of the relevant jurisdiction."
