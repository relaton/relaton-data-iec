abstract:
- content: The Smart Cities Reference Architecture Methodology (SCRAM) proposes a
    common methodology for developing the Smart Cities Reference Architecture (SCRA),
    which is a tailorable template for architectures of, practically, any city system.
    SCRAM reviews and defines the desired characteristics of Smart Cities, diverse
    SCRA viewpoints and corresponding SCRA model types in order to promote consistency
    and uniformity across architectures for various smart cities.
