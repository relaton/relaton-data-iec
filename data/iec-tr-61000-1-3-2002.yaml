  content: The purpose of this Technical Report is to describe the effects that have
    occurred during actual and simulated electromagnetic pulse testing throughout
    the world. These effects include those observed during the high-altitude nuclear
    tests conducted by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1962, and the HEMP
    simulator tests conducted by many countries during the years after atmospheric
    testing ended. In addition to direct effects, this technical report also contains
    information on HEMP coupling to "long lines" as it is important to verify that
    particular levels of currents and voltages can be induced by HEMP on these lines;
    this provides a basis for direct injection testing of electronic equipment. It
    should be noted that, in most cases, the electrical equipment tested or exposed
    did not contain the sensitive electronics in use today. Also it should be emphasized
    that all tests and exposures did not produce failure of the equipment; factors
    such as the geometry of the HEMP interaction and the electromagnetic shielding
    of the equipment are variables that can produce differing results. The description
    of these effects is intended to illustrate the seriousness of the possible effects
    of HEMP on modern electronic systems.
