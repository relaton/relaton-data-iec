abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 29110-5-1-1:2012 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises,
    organizations, departments or projects up to 25 people. The life cycle processes
    described in the set of International Standards (IS) Profiles and Technical Reports
    (TR) are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger
    than VSEs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-1:2012 provides the management and engineering
    guide to the entry profile described in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through project management
    and software implementation processes. ISO/IEC TR 29110‑5‑1‑1:2012 is a stand-alone
    guide. It is not intended for a VSE to use the standardized profile to implement
    ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-1:2012.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-1:2012 applies for
    software development project. The project may be to fulfil an external or internal
    contract. The internal contract need not be explicit between the project team
    and their customer.<br />\r\nUsing ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-1:2012, a VSE can obtain
    the following benefits:<br />\r\n1) an agreed set of project requirements and
    expected products is delivered to the customer;<br />\r\n2) a disciplined management
    process, that provides project visibility and corrective actions of project problems
    and deviations, is performed;<br />\r\n3) a systematic software implementation
    process, that satisfies customer needs and ensures quality products, is followed.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-1:2012 is targeted at VSEs (a start-up VSE that started
    the operation less than 3 years ago and/or with a project size less than 6 person-months).<br
    />\r\nIt is intended to be used with any processes, techniques and methods that
    enhance the VSE's customer satisfaction and productivity."
