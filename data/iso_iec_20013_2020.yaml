    the requirements of learners, instructors, e-learning service providers and others
    in contexts such as K-12 education, higher education, training and personal development.</p><p>The
    reference framework identifies content and functional components that support
    e-Portfolio systems. It addresses interoperability issues required for data exchange
    between these components and among the various categories.</p><p>This document:</p><p>—
    provides an e-Portfolio reference framework;</p><p>— provides descriptions of
    e-Portfolios in terms of components (content or functional), categories, elements
    and items;</p><p>— identifies commonalities of current implementations of e-Portfolios;
    and,</p><p>— represents the needs of stakeholders (learners, instructors, etc.).</p><p>This
    document does not include:</p><p>— in-depth technical review of issues related
    to adaptability to culture, language, and human functions;</p><p>— security techniques
    related to the protection of privacy information;</p><p>— authentication of the
    identity of an IT or ITLET system user;</p><p>— how e-Portfolios might integrate
