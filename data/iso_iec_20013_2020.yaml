abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a reference framework of e-Portfolio implementation
    that can be used to inform and support development of ITLET systems that meet
    the requirements of learners, instructors, e-learning service providers and others
    in contexts such as K-12 education, higher education, training and personal development.<br
    />\r\nThe reference framework identifies content and functional components that
    support e-Portfolio systems. It addresses interoperability issues required for
    data exchange between these components and among the various categories.<br />\r\nThis
    document:<br />\r\n- provides an e-Portfolio reference framework;<br />\r\n- provides
    descriptions of e-Portfolios in terms of components (content or functional), categories,
    elements and items;<br />\r\n- identifies commonalities of current implementations
    of e-Portfolios; and,<br />\r\n- represents the needs of stakeholders (learners,
    instructors, etc.).<br />\r\nThis document does not include:<br />\r\n- in-depth
    technical review of issues related to adaptability to culture, language, and human
    functions;<br />\r\n- security techniques related to the protection of privacy
    information;<br />\r\n- authentication of the identity of an IT or ITLET system
    user;<br />\r\n- how e-Portfolios might integrate with ITLET systems; and,<br
    />\r\n- specific requirements of e-Portfolios or e-Portfolio systems to meet jurisdictional
