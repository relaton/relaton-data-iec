abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 provides a consolidated vocabulary of eBusiness
    concepts as found and defined in ISO/IEC 14662 and the existing parts of ISO/IEC
    15944, namely, Parts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 along with their associated terms.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15944-7:2009 provides the rules, guidelines and procedures governing the formation
    of definitions for concepts relevant to eBusiness and choice of terms as a single,
    harmonized and integrated controlled vocabulary. This includes those governing
    multilingual expandability which incorporates and integrates cultural capability.</p><p>As
    such, ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 facilitates the production of human interface equivalents
    (HIEs) of eBusiness terms and definitions in the various official (and de facto)
    languages of ISO members.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 identifies the essential
    elements of an entry in this controlled vocabulary as well as their rules and
    specifications. It also includes rules for ensuring quality and integrity control
    requirement for each entry and the interworking among the entries while doing
    so in an IT-enabled manner. It also addresses maintenance and update procedures.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15944-7:2009 is built on ISO/IEC 14662 and the existing Parts 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6
    of ISO/IEC 15944. The exclusions which apply to one or more of these International
    Standards apply to ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009</p><p>ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 does not currently
    support the following requirements (in no particular order):</p><ol><li>the more
    detailed level of rules (and possible more detailed level of granularity) for
    the essential elements of “eBusiness vocabulary” entry, as currently specified
    in 5.3;</li><li>the more detailed level of rules for change management of the
    eBusiness vocabulary. It is most likely that these will be addressed in the second
    edition (and will be based on or harmonized with the rules in ISO/IEC 15944-2:2006,
    Clause 6.5 “Registration Status”);</li><li>the inclusion of added non-essential,
    i.e. conditional or optional, elements for a controlled vocabulary entry;</li><li>the
    addition of eBusiness concepts with their definitions and associated terms which
    are not found in ISO/IEC 14662 or any part of ISO/IEC 15944;</li><li>the ability
    to be able to fully support the set of external constraints of jurisdictional
    documents pertaining to individual accessibility requirements;</li><li>the provision
    of Human Interface Equivalents (HIEs) of jurisdictional domains which are administrative
    sub-divisions of a UN member state;</li><li>the identification of and rules for
    “non-essential” or optional elements of an entry in the controlled vocabulary;</li><li>the
    incorporation of individual accessibility requirements, (e.g. as summarized in
    the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled Persons);</li><li>the establishment
    of a Registration Authority;</li><li>the development of a “template” of the nature
    found in the other parts of ISO/IEC 15944.</li></ol><p>It is anticipated that
    some or all of these requirements will be addressed in future editions of this
    part of ISO/IEC 15944, in companion International Standards, or in Technical Reports.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15944-7:2009 does not assume nor endorse any specific system environment, database
    management system, database design paradigm, system development methodology, data
    definition language, command language, system interface, user interface, syntax,
    computing platform, or any technology required for implementation, i.e. it is
    information technology neutral. At the same time, ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 maximizes
    an IT-enabled approach to its implementation and maximizes semantic interoperability.</p>"
