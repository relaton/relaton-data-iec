abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-7:2009 provides a consolidated vocabulary of eBusiness concepts as found
    and defined in ISO/IEC 14662 and the existing parts of ISO/IEC 15944, namely,
    Parts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 and 7 along with their associated terms.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-7:2009 provides the rules, guidelines and procedures governing the formation
    of definitions for concepts relevant to eBusiness and choice of terms as a single,
    harmonized and integrated controlled vocabulary. This includes those governing
    multilingual expandability which incorporates and integrates cultural capability.<br
    />\r\nAs such, ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 facilitates the production of human interface
    equivalents (HIEs) of eBusiness terms and definitions in the various official
    (and de facto) languages of ISO members.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 identifies
    the essential elements of an entry in this controlled vocabulary as well as their
    rules and specifications. It also includes rules for ensuring quality and integrity
    control requirement for each entry and the interworking among the entries while
    doing so in an IT-enabled manner. It also addresses maintenance and update procedures.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 is built on ISO/IEC 14662 and the existing Parts 1,
    2, 4, 5 and 6 of ISO/IEC 15944. The exclusions which apply to one or more of these
    International Standards apply to ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-7:2009
    does not currently support the following requirements (in no particular order):<br
    />\r\nthe more detailed level of rules (and possible more detailed level of granularity)
    for the essential elements of “eBusiness vocabulary” entry, as currently specified
    in 5.3;<br />\r\nthe more detailed level of rules for change management of the
    eBusiness vocabulary. It is most likely that these will be addressed in the second
    edition (and will be based on or harmonized with the rules in ISO/IEC 15944-2:2006,
    Clause 6.5 “Registration Status”);<br />\r\nthe inclusion of added non-essential,
    i.e. conditional or optional, elements for a controlled vocabulary entry;<br />\r\nthe
    addition of eBusiness concepts with their definitions and associated terms which
    are not found in ISO/IEC 14662 or any part of ISO/IEC 15944;<br />\r\nthe ability
    to be able to fully support the set of external constraints of jurisdictional
    documents pertaining to individual accessibility requirements;<br />\r\nthe provision
    of Human Interface Equivalents (HIEs) of jurisdictional domains which are administrative
    sub-divisions of a UN member state;<br />\r\nthe identification of and rules for
    “non-essential” or optional elements of an entry in the controlled vocabulary;<br
    />\r\nthe incorporation of individual accessibility requirements, (e.g. as summarized
    in the UN Convention on the Rights of Disabled Persons);<br />\r\nthe establishment
    of a Registration Authority;<br />\r\nthe development of a “template” of the nature
    found in the other parts of ISO/IEC 15944.<br />\r\nIt is anticipated that some
    or all of these requirements will be addressed in future editions of this part
    of ISO/IEC 15944, in companion International Standards, or in Technical Reports.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 does not assume nor endorse any specific system environment,
    database management system, database design paradigm, system development methodology,
    data definition language, command language, system interface, user interface,
    syntax, computing platform, or any technology required for implementation, i.e.
    it is information technology neutral. At the same time, ISO/IEC 15944-7:2009 maximizes
    an IT-enabled approach to its implementation and maximizes semantic interoperability."
