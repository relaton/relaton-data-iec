abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61850-6-3:2025, which is a Technical Specification, describes how
    to use and define formal rules, in a machine-processable format: OCL, that can
    be imported and interpreted by tools.<br />\r\nThe following main use cases are
    supported:<br />\r\n– Validate SCL files at every stage of the specification and
    engineering process;<br />\r\n– Verify the conformity of a SCL file after completion
    of the upgrading/downgrading rules;<br />\r\n– Extend standard OCL rules with
    private OCL rules<br />\r\nThe purpose of this document is limited to the publication
    of the format and method to write correct and structured rules. The rules themselves
    are published as code components of the corresponding IEC 61850 parts."
