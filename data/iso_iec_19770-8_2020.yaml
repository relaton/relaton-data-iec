abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines requirements, guidelines, formats and approaches
    for use when producing a mapping document that defines how industry practices
    map to/from the ISO/IEC 19770 series.</p><p>This edition is focused solely on
    mappings to/from both the second edition of ISO/IEC 19770-1 that was published
    in 2012, or the third edition of ISO/IEC 19770-1 that was published in 2017. However,
    the title of this document is deliberately more general as it is expected that
    future editions of this document also include mapping frameworks related to other
    parts of the ISO/IEC 19770 series.</p><p>In this document where reference is made
    to ISO/IEC 19770-1 without the specification of an edition number or a publication
    year, then the text applies to all editions of ISO/IEC 19770-1.</p>"
