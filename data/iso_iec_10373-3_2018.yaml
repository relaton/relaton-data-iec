abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 10373-3:2018 This document defines test methods for characteristics
    of integrated circuit cards with contacts and related interface devices according
    to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7816-3. Each test method is cross‑referenced
    to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 that defines the information
    storage technologies employed in identification card applications.<br />\r\nNOTE
    Criteria for acceptability do not form part of this document but can be found
    in the International Standards mentioned above.<br />\r\nThis document defines
    test methods which are specific to integrated circuit technology with contacts.
    ISO/IEC 10373-1 defines test methods which are common to one or more card technologies
    and other parts of the ISO/IEC 10373 series define other technology‑specific tests.<br
    />\r\nTest methods defined in this document are intended to be performed separately
    and independently. A given card is not required to pass through all the tests
    sequentially. The test methods defined in this document are based on ISO/IEC 7816-3.<br
    />\r\nConformance of cards and IFDs determined using the test methods defined
    in this document does not preclude failures in the field. Reliability testing
    is outside the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document does not define
    any test to establish the complete functioning of integrated circuit cards. The
    test methods require only that the minimum functionality be verified. The minimum
    functionality is defined as follows.<br />\r\n- Any integrated circuit present
    in the card continues to show an Answer to Reset response which conforms to the
    base standard.<br />\r\n- Any contacts associated with any integrated circuit
    present in the card continue to show electrical resistance which conforms to the
    base standard."
