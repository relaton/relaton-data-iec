abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines test methods for characteristics of integrated
    circuit cards with contacts and related interface devices according to the definition
    given in ISO/IEC 7816-3. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base
    standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 that defines the information storage technologies
    employed in identification card applications.</p><p>NOTE Criteria for acceptability
    do not form part of this document but can be found in the International Standards
    mentioned above.</p><p>This document defines test methods which are specific to
    integrated circuit technology with contacts. ISO/IEC 10373-1 defines test methods
    which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts of the ISO/IEC
    10373 series define other technology‑specific tests.</p><p>Test methods defined
    in this document are intended to be performed separately and independently. A
    given card is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially. The test
    methods defined in this document are based on ISO/IEC 7816-3.</p><p>Conformance
    of cards and IFDs determined using the test methods defined in this document does
    not preclude failures in the field. Reliability testing is outside the scope of
    this document.</p><p>This document does not define any test to establish the complete
    functioning of integrated circuit cards. The test methods require only that the
    minimum functionality be verified. The minimum functionality is defined as follows.</p><p>—
    Any integrated circuit present in the card continues to show an Answer to Reset
    response which conforms to the base standard.</p><p>— Any contacts associated
    with any integrated circuit present in the card continue to show electrical resistance
    which conforms to the base standard.</p>"
