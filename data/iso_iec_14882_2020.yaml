abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies requirements for implementations of the C++
    programming language. The first such requirement is that they implement the language,
    so this document also defines C++. Other requirements</p><p>and relaxations of
    the first requirement appear at various places within this document.</p><p> C++
    is a general purpose programming language based on the C programming language
    as described in</p><p>ISO/IEC 9899:2018<em>Programming languages â€” C</em>(hereinafter
    referred to as the<em>C standard</em>). C++ provides</p><p>many facilities beyond
    those provided by C, including additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions,</p><p>namespaces,
    operator overloading, function name overloading, references, free store management
    operators,</p><p>and additional library facilities.</p>"
