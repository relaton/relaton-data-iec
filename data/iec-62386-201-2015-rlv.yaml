  content: "IEC 62386-201:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62386-201:2015(E)
    specifies a bus system for control by digital signals of electronic lighting equipment.
    This electronic lighting equipment should be in line with the requirements of
    IEC 61347. This document is applicable to control gear associated with fluorescent
    lamps. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2009 and constitutes a technical revision. The essential changes with respect
    to the first edition are:<br />\r\n- references to subclauses in IEC 62386-101
    and IEC 62386-102 updated to the new structure of the standard;<br />\r\n- test
    sequence reworked and description of the test sequences in form of a pseudo code
    instead of flow charts."
