abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-17-1:2011(E) describes the motivation, use and interaction
    of the three services that comprise version 3 of the UPnP-QoS Framework:<br/>
    \n- The QosDevice:3 Service [QD:3],<br/> \n- The QosPolicyHolder:3 Service [QPH:3],<br/>
    \n- and The QosManager:3 Service [QM:3]. It does not define a new device type.
    Since Quality of Service issues need to be solved for multiple usage scenarios,
    it is expected that vendors could use any UPnP device as a container for the services
    defined by UPnPQoS. The UPnP-QoS Framework is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0."
