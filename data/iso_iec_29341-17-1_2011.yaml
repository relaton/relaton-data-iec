abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-17-1:2011 describes the motivation, use and interaction of the three services
    that comprise version 3 of the UPnP-QoS Framework:<br />\r\n- The QosDevice:3
    Service [QD:3],<br />\r\n- The QosPolicyHolder:3 Service [QPH:3],<br />\r\n- and
    The QosManager:3 Service [QM:3]. It does not define a new device type. Since Quality
    of Service issues need to be solved for multiple usage scenarios, it is expected
    that vendors could use any UPnP device as a container for the services defined
    by UPnPQoS. The UPnP-QoS Framework is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0."
