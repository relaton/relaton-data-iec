abstract:
- content: "<p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>This standard is part of the POSIX
    Â® series of standards for applications and user inter-faces to</p><p>open systems.
    It defines the Ada language bindings as package specifications and accompanying
    textual</p><p>descriptions of the application program interface (API). This standard
    supports application portability at the</p><p>source code level through the binding
    between ISO 8652:1995 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (IEEE Std</p><p>1003.1-1996)
    (POSIX) as amended by IEEE P1003.1g/D6.6. Terminology and general requirements,
    process</p><p>primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input
    and output primaries, device- and classspecific</p><p>functions, language-specific
    services for Ada, system databases, synchronization, memory</p><p>management,
    execution scheduling, clocks and timers, message passing, task management, the
    XTI and</p><p>socket detailed network inter-faces, event management, network support
    functions, and protocol-specific</p><p>mappings are covered. It also specifies
    behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada.</p>"
