- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p><strong>Abstract:</strong></p><p>This
    standard is part of the POSIX ® series of standards for applications and user
    inter-faces to</p><p>open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package
    specifications and accompanying textual</p><p>descriptions of the application
    program interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the</p><p>source
    code level through the binding between ISO 8652:1995 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
    (IEEE Std</p><p>1003.1-1996) (POSIX) as amended by IEEE P1003.1g/D6.6. Terminology
    and general requirements, process</p><p>primitives, the process environment, files
    and directories, input and output primaries, device- and classspecific</p><p>functions,
    language-specific services for Ada, system databases, synchronization, memory</p><p>management,
    execution scheduling, clocks and timers, message passing, task management, the
    XTI and</p><p>socket detailed network inter-faces, event management, network support
    functions, and protocol-specific</p><p>mappings are covered. It also specifies
    behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada.</p>
