abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9594-1:2017 provides the directory capabilities required by OSI
    applications, OSI management processes, other OSI layer entities, and telecommunications
    services. Among the capabilities which it provides are those of &quot;user-friendly
    naming&quot;, whereby objects can be referred to by names which are suitable for
    citing by human users (though not all objects need have user-friendly names);
    and &quot;name-to-address mapping&quot; which allows the binding between objects
    and their locations to be dynamic. The latter capability allows OSI networks,
    for example, to be &quot;self-configuring&quot; in the sense that addition, removal
    and the changes of object location do not affect OSI network operation.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 9594-1:2017 is not intended to be a general-purpose database system,
    although it may be built on such systems. It is assumed, for instance, that, as
    is typical with communications directories, there is a considerably higher frequency
    of &quot;queries&quot; than of updates. The rate of updates is expected to be
    governed by the dynamics of people and organizations, rather than, for example,
    the dynamics of networks. There is also no need for instantaneous global commitment
    of updates; transient conditions, where both old and new versions of the same
    information are available, are quite acceptable.<br /><br />\r\nIt is a characteristic
    of the Directory that, except as a consequence of differing access rights or un-propagated
    updates, the results of directory queries will not be dependent on the identity
    or location of the inquirer. This characteristic renders the Directory unsuitable
    for some telecommunications applications, for example some types of routing. For
    cases where the results are dependent on the identity of the inquirer, access
    to directory information and updates of the Directory may be denied."
