abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63401-2:2022, which is a technical report, covers the \"control
    interactions\" in converter interfaced generators e.g, wind and PV with the frequency
    of the resulting oscillation below twice the system frequency. SSCI can be categorized
    into:<br />\r\n1) SSCI in DFIG is caused by the interaction between DFIG wind
    turbine converter controls and the series compensated network.<br />\r\n2) SSCI
    involving FSC (both type-4 wind turbine or PV generators) is caused by the interaction
    between wind turbine or solar PV's FSC controls and weak AC grid.<br />\r\nThis
    technical report is organized into nine clauses. Clause 1 gives a brief introduction
    and highlights the scope of this document. Clause 4 presents the historical background
    of various types of subsynchronous oscillation (SSO) and revisits the terminologies,
    definitions, and classification in the context of classical SSR and emerging SSCI
    issues to better understand and classify the emerging interaction phenomena. Clause
    5 provides the description, mechanism, and characteristics of the SSCI phenomenon
    in the framework of real-world incidents, including the SSCI events in the ERCOT,
    Guyuan, and Hami wind power systems. Clause 6 proposes two benchmark models to
    study the SSCI DFIG and FSC-based wind turbines or PV generators. Clause 7 gives
    an overview of existing and emerging modeling and stability analysis approaches
    to investigate the SSCI phenomenon. Clause 8 outlines various techniques to mitigate
    the SSCI. It discusses various SSCI mitigation schemes, such as bypassing the
    series capacitor, selective tripping of WTGs, generator, and plant-level damping
    control schemes. Clause 9 highlights the need for future works towards standardization
    of terms, definitions, classification, analysis methods, benchmark models, and
    mitigation methods."
