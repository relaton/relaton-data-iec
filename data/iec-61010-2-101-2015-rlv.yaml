  content: "IEC 61010-2-101:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-101:2015
    applies to equipment intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical purposes,
    including self-test IVD medical purposes. It has the status of a group safety
    function, as specified in IEC Guide 104. This standard has been prepared in close
    collaboration with Working Group CENELEC BTTF 88.1. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2002. It constitutes a technical revision
    and includes the following significant changes from the first edition, as well
    as numerous other changes:<br />\r\n- excluded IEC 61010-2-081 (general laboratory
    equipment) from the scope. This separates IEC 61010-2-081 and IEC 61010-2-101
    equipment;<br />\r\n- updated Biohazard and Lot symbols in Table 1 in Clause 5;<br
    />\r\n- added requirement for within expiration consumables and authorized representative
    details in Instructions for Use to Clause 5;<br />\r\n- added requirement for
    gas or liquid markings and ratings to Clause 5;<br />\r\n- added requirement to
    include OPERATOR instructions to deal with consumable or sample spills, jams or
    breakage inside equipment, disposal of hazardous waste, personal protection, RISK
    reduction procedures relating to flammable liquids, burns from surfaces, and loading
    and unloading of sample and reagents in Instructions for Use to Clause 5;<br />\r\n-
    added requirement for manufacturer to provide instructions on equipment transport,
    storage and removal from use to Clause 5;<br />\r\n- added normative reference
    ISO 18113-5 for instructions for use of self-test IVD medical equipment in Clause
    5;<br />\r\n- added requirement for OPERATOR maintenance instructions to Clause
    7;<br />\r\n- added requirements for sample zones and loading zones to Clause
    7;<br />\r\n- excluded equipment whose size and weight make unintentional movement
    unlikely from drop test in Clause 8;<br />\r\n- added requirement for biohazard
    marking to Clause 13;<br />\r\n- added requirement for interlock systems containing
    electric/electronic or programmable components to Clause 15;<br />\r\n- added
    informative reference to Usability standard IEC 62366 to Clause 16;<br />\r\n-
    replaced Clause 17 with requirements of ISO 14971 for RISK assessment.<br />\r\n-
    Annex BB Instructions for use for self-testing IVD Medical Equipment deleted and
    a reference given to ISO 18113-5 in Clause 5."
