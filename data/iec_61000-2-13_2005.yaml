abstract:
- content: IEC 61000-2-13:2005 defines a set of typical radiated and conducted HPEM
    environment waveforms that may be encountered in civil facilities. Such threat
    environments can produce damaging effects on electrical and electronic equipment
    in the civilian sector, as described in IEC 61000-1-5. It is necessary to define
    the radiated and conducted environments, in order to develop protection methods.
    For the purposes of this standard, high-power conditions are achieved when the
    peak electric field exceeds 100 V&#x2F;m, corresponding to a plane-wave free-space
    power density of 26,5 W&#x2F;m2. This criterion is intended to define the application
    of this standard to EM radiated and conducted environments that are substantially
    higher than those considered for &quot;normal&quot; EMC applications, which are
    covered by the standards produced by IEC SC 77B.
