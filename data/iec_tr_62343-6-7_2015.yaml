abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 62343-6-7:2015(E) which is a technical report, describes optical
    channel monitor modules, one of several important classes of dynamic modules that
    are used in dynamic optical networks. This report includes a description of the
    necessity of optical channel monitors, specifically in the context of dynamic
    optical networks, and how this is driving feature and performance requirements.
    This technical report surveys the different categories of optical channel monitor
    technologies that are being used and highlights some of their unique characteristics.
    Also described are different possible approaches for characterizing and specifying
    the performance of optical channel monitor modules. Keywords: optical channel
    monitor modules, dynamic optical networks, dynamic modules'
