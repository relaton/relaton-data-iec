abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 24707:2007 defines Common Logic: a first-order logic framework
    intended for information exchange and transmission. The heart of the framework
    is a complete abstract syntax and abstract semantics for Common Logic, which provides
    the basis for many different concrete syntactic forms, called dialects, which
    conform to the syntax and semantics. Common Logic has some novel features, chief
    among them being a syntax which is signature-free and permits ''higher-order''
    constructions such as quantification over classes or relations while preserving
    a first-order model theory, and a semantics which allows theories to describe
    intensional entities such as classes or properties. It also fixes the meanings
    of a few conventions in widespread use, such as numerals to denote integers and
    quotation marks to denote character strings, and has provision for the use of
    datatypes and for naming, importing and transmitting content on the World Wide
    Web. ISO/IEC 24707:2007 defines the abstract syntax and semantics, and three concrete
    dialects are defined in the annexes. The three conforming dialects specified are
    Common Logic Interchange Format (CLIF), Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF)
    and XML for Common Logic (XCL).'
