  content: IEC 61400-6:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies requirements and general principles
    to be used in assessing the structural integrity of onshore wind turbine support
    structures (including foundations). The scope includes the geotechnical assessment
    of the soil for generic or site specific purposes. The strength of any flange
    and connection system connected to the rotor nacelle assembly (including connection
    to the yaw bearing) are designed and documented according to this document or
    according to IEC 61400-1. The scope includes all life cycle issues that may affect
    the structural integrity such as assembly and maintenance. The contents of the
    corrigendum of November 2020 have been included in this copy.
