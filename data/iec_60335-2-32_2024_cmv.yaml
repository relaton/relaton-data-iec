abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-32:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-32:2024 edition 6.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-32:2019
    edition 5.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-32:2024 deals with the safety of electric massage appliances
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples
    of appliances within the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n- foot massagers;<br
    />\r\n- water filled foot massagers;<br />\r\n- hand-held massagers;<br />\r\n-
    massage beds;<br />\r\n- massage belts;<br />\r\n- massage chairs;<br />\r\n-
    massage pads.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use but that
    nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended
    to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n-
    for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- electric foot care appliances that do not contain
    motors and other electric appliances for the care of skin or hair (IEC 60335-2-23);<br
    />\r\n- electric appliances for beauty care of persons and intended for household,
    commercial and similar purposes (IEC 60335-2-115).<br />\r\nThis sixth edition
    cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment
    with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text
    (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) application of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
