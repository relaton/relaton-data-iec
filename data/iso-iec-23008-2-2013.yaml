  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23008-2:2013 specifies high efficiency video coding. It was
    developed in response to the growing need for higher compression of moving pictures
    for various applications such as videoconferencing, digital storage media, television
    broadcasting, internet streaming, and communications. It is also designed to enable
    the use of the coded video representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety
    of network environments as well as to enable the use of multi-core parallel encoding
    and decoding devices. The use of ISO/IEC 23008-2:2013 allows motion video to be
    manipulated as a form of computer data and to be stored on various storage media,
    transmitted and received over existing and future networks and distributed on
    existing and future broadcasting channels.</p>"
