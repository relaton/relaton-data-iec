abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62629-1-3:2026, which is Technical Report, is intended to gather
    technical information of depth perception by human and determination of the position
    of 3D object on the non-physical screen.<br />\r\nClause 4 and Clause 5 describe
    the human depth perception and its threshold. This information will be helpful
    in designing 3D displays of the non-physical screen type such as the possible
    depth difference of 3D objects. In the measurement of the display, understanding
    the response and limitation of the user is useful. Clause 4 and 5 provide such
    information in determining the 3D object on the non-physical screen.<br />\r\nIt
    is not the intention of this document to set the requirement of the measurement
    system in determining the position of 3D object on the non-physical screen."
