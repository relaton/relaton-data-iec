  content: "IEC TS 62607-4-5:2017(E) provides a standardized method for the determination
    of electrochemical properties of cathode nanomaterials such as lithium iron phosphate
    (LFP) for electrical energy storage devices. This method will enable the industry
    to:\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li>decide whether or not
    a cathode nanomaterial is usable, and</li>\r\n\t<li>select a cathode nanomaterial
    suitable for their application.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nThis document includes:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>recommendations
    for sample preparation,</li>\r\n\t<li>outlines of the experimental procedures
    used to measure cathode nanomaterial properties,</li>\r\n\t<li>methods of interpretation
    of results and discussion of data analysis, and</li>\r\n\t<li>case studies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nNOTE
    The very purpose of this method is to arrive at a detailed characterization of
    the electrodes so that individual contribution of the anode and cathode for performance
    and degradation could be predicted. The method can be applied for characterization
    of the electrode working as cathode or/and as anode."
