  content: "<p>The aim of this Guide is to assist technical committees in drafting
    standards in such a way that they are suitable for certification purposes. It
    must be borne in mind that such standards could also be used for other purposes
    such as in contractual documents between buyer and seller and the like. For certification
    purposes a number of aspects with which standards should normally comply, require
    emphasis. These relate to the specific inclusion or exclusion of items in the
    standard. The standard should be prepared in such a manner that easy reference
    to or use of it can be made. For this, specific requirements are given.</p>"
