abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2005 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-7, but does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.The test methods require
    only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented,
    be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further,
    application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general
    case.The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2005
    are the following:mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values
    and tolerances;parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and
    inter-operability.The following are not included in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2005:parameters
    that are already included in regulatory test requirements;high-level data encoding
    conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962). Unless otherwise
    specified, the tests in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2005 apply exclusively to RFID tags
    and interrogator defined in ISO/IEC 18000-7.
