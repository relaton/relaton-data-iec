abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 21000-12:2005 specifies a test bed that is designed to assist
    in performance assessment of MPEG-21, Scalable Video Codec (SVC) for streaming
    applications, and for the evaluation of resource delivery technologies over unreliable
    packet-switched networks. The streaming protocols used in the test bed are based
    on RTSP and RTP. The Network Adaptation QoS mechanism of MPEG-21 Digital Item
    Adaptation (DIA) is used for bandwidth-scalable streaming. A subset of MPEG-4
    IPMP is also included in the test bed so that encrypted streaming and layered
    access functionality of a DRM system can be tested for different SVC designs.The
    test bed includes a network emulator GUI that interfaces with a Linux-based network
    emulator, NistNet, for real-time emulation of channel characteristics of various
    networks. Therefore:Various scalable codec (audio, video, scene composition) technologies
    can be evaluated.Various packetization methods and file formats can be evaluated.Various
    multimedia streaming rate control and error control mechanisms can be plugged
    into the test bed and evaluated.In summary, the following MPEG technologies are
    demonstrated by the test bed:MPEG scalable audio and video codecs;MPEG-4 on IP;MPEG-4
    IPMP (a small subset); andMPEG-21 DIA Network Adaptation QoS.The architecture
    and the API are not tied to any particular media codecs. However, currently only
    the MPEG-4 FGS video and MPEG-4 BSAC audio are officially supported by the software.
    The support for ISO/IEC 21000-13 (MPEG-21 part 13) SVC will be included when that
    International Standard is ready.
