    <p>This document specifies a method for determining scanning productivity by measuring "scanning speed", "scan to network folder speed" and "scan to PC speed". It includes test files, test setup procedure, test procedure and the reporting requirements for the scanning productivity measurements. This document is applicable to scanning devices including but not limited to multi-function devices, networked scanners and single-function scanners of any underlying scanning technology.</p>
    <p>This document is applicable to devices which are able to scan a media size of A4/8,5" × 11" and which have an automatic document feeder (ADF). It is also applicable to devices which have the ability to scan to network folder, or folder on PC and do not require, but can use, other application programs on a computer or another device to perform a scanning job.</p>
    <p>This document does not apply to testing and measurement of scan to USB, scan to local hard drive or other storage medium that is part of or plugged into the scanner.</p>
    <p>This document is not intended to be used for image quality measurement, document or record management of any scanned images.</p>
