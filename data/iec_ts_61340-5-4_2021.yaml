abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61340-5-4:2021(E) describes compliance verification testing for
    technical items that are included in ESD control programs, such as those specified
    in IEC 61340-5-1.<br />\r\nTest methods are based on those specified in IEC 61340-5-1
    and other parts of the IEC 61340 series, and are simplified where necessary for
    the purposes of compliance verification, to be performed by competent personnel.<br
    />\r\nUsers can, by reference to this document in their compliance verification
    plan, adopt the necessary test methods described herein without change or addition.
    Alternatively, test methods described in this document can be adapted to match
    the requirements of their own ESD control program, provided deviations in equipment
    or procedure are documented in their compliance verification plan.<br />\r\nCompliance
    verification test frequency is not specified in this document. Guidance on how
    users can consider compliance verification test frequency is given in informative
    Annex A.<br />\r\nProduct qualification is excluded from the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces IEC TR 61340-5-4 published in 2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to IEC TR 61340Â­5-4:\r\n \r\n\t test
    methods in the main body of the document have been made normative, and consequently
    normative references have been added; \r\n\t the term \"ESD ground\" has been
    added and defined; \r\n\t description of equipment for measuring low resistance
    has been added; \r\n\t user specified electrodes, including surface resistance
    bar electrodes, are permitted to be used for resistance measurements; \r\n\t an
    informative annex on verification of compliance verification test equipment has
    been added; \r\n\t compliance verification of person-footwear-flooring systems
    by measuring body voltage has been moved to an informative annex."
