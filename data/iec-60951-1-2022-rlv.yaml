  content: "IEC 60951-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60951-1:2022
    provides general guidance on the design principles and performance criteria for
    equipment to measure radiation and fluid (gaseous effluents or liquids) radioactivity
    levels at nuclear facilities during and after design basis accidents (DBA) and
    design extension conditions (DEC), including severe accident (SA). This document
    is limited to equipment for continuous monitoring of radioactivity in design basis
    accidents (DBA), design extension conditions (DEC), including severe accident
    (SA) and post-accident conditions. The purpose of this document is to lay down
    general requirements and give examples of acceptable methods for equipment for
    continuous monitoring of radioactivity within the facility during and after design
    basis accidents (DBA), design extension conditions (DEC), including severe accident
    (SA) in nuclear facilities. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2009.The main technical changes with regard to the previous
    edition are as follows.<br />\r\n- title modified.<br />\r\n- to be consistent
    with the categorization of the accident condition.<br />\r\n- to update the references
    to new standards published since the second edition.<br />\r\n- to update the
    terms and definitions.\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\"> </div>"
