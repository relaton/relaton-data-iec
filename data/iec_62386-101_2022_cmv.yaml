    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare

    CSV edition 2.1. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 34 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62386-101:2022 is
    applicable to system components in a bus system for control by digital signals
    of electronic lighting equipment. The control methods, algorithms and data exchange
    methods of application controllers used for lighting control are not within the
    scope of the IEC 62386 series. EMC requirements are not within the scope of the
    IEC 62386 series. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2014 and Amendment 1:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tthe scope has been updated;\r\n\tsafety and earthing
    have been updated and extended;\r\n\treferences have been updated;\r\n\tthe use
    of bus-power and external-power has been clarified;\r\n\tpolarity sensitivity
    for bus units including a bus power supply has been updated;\r\n\tframe sizes
