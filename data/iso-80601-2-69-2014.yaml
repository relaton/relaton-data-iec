  content: ISO 80601-2-69:2014 specifies requirements for the basic safety and essential
    performance of an oxygen concentrator in combination with its accessories, hereafter
    referred to as ME equipment, intended to increase the oxygen concentration of
    gas intended to be delivered to a single patient. Such oxygen concentrators are
    typically intended for use in the home healthcare environment, including transit-operable
    use by a single patient in various environments including any private and public
    transportation as well as in commercial aircraft. ISO 80601-2-69:2014 is applicable
    to a transit-operable and non-transit-operable oxygen concentrator. It is applicable
    to an oxygen concentrator integrated into or used with other medical devices,
    ME equipment or ME systems.
