abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29167-14:2015 defines the cryptographic suite for AES using OFB
    mode (AES OFB) for the ISO/IEC 18000â€‘63 air interface standard for radio frequency
    identification (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common cryptographic
    suite for security for RFID devices that can be referenced by ISO committees for
    air interface standards and application standards.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29167-14:2015
    specifies a cryptographic suite for AES OFB for air interface for RFID systems.
    The cryptographic suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 29167-14:2015 defines various authentication methods and methods
    of use for the cipher. A tag and an interrogator can support one, a subset, or
    all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported."
