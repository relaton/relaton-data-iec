abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 16512-2:2016 specifies the relayed multicast protocol part
    2 (RMCP-2), an application‑layer protocol that constructs a multicast tree for
    data delivery from one sender to multiple receivers over an IP-based network,
    where IP multicast is not fully deployed. RMCP-2 defines relayed multicast data
    transport capabilities over IP‑based networks for simplex group applications.</p><p>This
    Recommendation | International Standard specifies the following:</p><p>a) descriptions
    of the entities, control and data delivery models of RMCP-2;</p><p>b) description
    of the functions and procedures of multicast agents (MAs) to construct a one-to-many
    relayed data path and to relay data for simplex communication;</p><p>c) description
    of the security features of the basic RMCP-2; and</p><p>d) definitions of messages
    and parameters of the basic RMCP-2 and secure RMCP-2.</p><p>Annex A defines a
    membership authentication procedure for use with the secure RMCP-2. Annex B provides
    a method for sharing information among session managers (SMs) when multiple SMs
    are used. Annexes C‑G provide informative material related to RMCP-2. Annex H
    contains an informative bibliography.</p>"
