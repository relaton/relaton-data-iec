abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 18328-3:2016 specifies the logical interface of an application
    supporting the necessary security features in a card-IC which communicates with
    the external world by a physical interface supporting APDUs. This application
    supports the usage of electronic devices.</p><p>This involves the design of commands,
    data structures and security mechanisms which are required to handle the data
    and handling the additional devices itself. The handling of the additional devices
    is always controlled by the card-IC. External inputs or outputs shall be managed
    by the existing interfaces. This document deals not with physical characteristics
    of the card and interface technology, but only with the logical aspects. Management
    of data for additional devices that is not subdued by the COS or application control
    is out of the scope of this document.</p><p>Definitions of coding requirement
    for "trust assessment" of the managed data like warning, font, colour etc. is
    in the scope of this document. A description of the logical internal interface
    functionality used by the COS or by device drivers, if any, is also part of this
    document.</p><p>Due to the fact that relevant technologies may evolve or be adopted
    very fast, this document defines commands and structures supporting extensions
    and adaptations.</p>
