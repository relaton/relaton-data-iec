  content: "This document specifies requirements for the repeatability and reproducibility
    of non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) simulators intended to test automated sphygmomanometers
    utilizing the oscillometric non-continuous method only.<br />\r\nIn addition,
    the pulse rate set on the NIBP simulator is tested.<br />\r\nThis document is
    not intended to relate the signals, generated by the NIBP simulator, to the oscillometric
    signal recorded in a cuff attached to a human. It does not intend to test the
    interaction between the NIBP simulator and the tested automated sphygmomanometer
    (e.g. the agreement of the set values of the NIBP simulator and the displayed
    values of the tested automated sphygmomanometer or the properties of the cuff
    and tubing, such as design or elastic properties).<br />\r\nNOTE 1 These parameters
    can be tested separately in a clinical investigation or by using different special
    test setups.<br />\r\nThis document does not check whether or not the NIBP simulator
    is able to test the accuracy of the absolute blood pressure value of oscillometric
    automated sphygmomanometers.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Usually this is tested by a clinical
    investigation according ISO 81060-2 or other protocols.<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to NIBP simulators testing automated sphygmomanometers for adults,
    children and neonates at the upper arm, thigh etc. and automated sphygmomanometers
    measuring at the wrist."
