abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62627-02:2010(E) reports the measurement results of two round robin
    test programs each carried out on SC/PC and SC/APC plug style fixed attenuators.
    The work was initiated at Cenelec TC 86BXA in June 2003 in order to get a clear
    understanding on the accuracy and repeatability of the spectral attenuation loss
    measurements on fixed attenuators.
