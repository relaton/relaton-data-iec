abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-98:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 60335-2-98:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-98:2023 deals with the safety
    of electric humidifiers for household and similar use, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances,
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.
    Examples of appliances that are within the scope of the standard are<br />\r\n-
    appliances that atomize water;<br />\r\n- appliances that evaporate water by heating;<br
    />\r\n- appliances that blow air through a moist element.<br />\r\nAppliances
    that are not intended for normal household use, but that nevertheless can be a
    source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen
    in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many
    countries additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances for
    heating liquids (IEC 60335-2-15);<br />\r\n- humidifiers intended for use with
    heating, ventilation or air-conditioning systems (IEC 60335-2-88);<br />\r\n-
    appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601 series);<br />\r\n- appliances intended
    exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used
    in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2004 and Amendment
    2:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) additional requirements
    for a humidifier shaped or decorated like a toy (7.12, 8.1.1, 21.101, 22.12, 22.44,
    22.54, 22.105);<br />\r\nc) additional requirements are included for the temperature
    of accessible surfaces (11.8);<br />\r\nd) application of test probes 18 and 19
    has been introduced (Clause 8, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\ne) additional guidance
    is provided for humidifiers for remote operation.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be
    used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
