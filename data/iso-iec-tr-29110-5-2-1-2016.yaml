    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110:2016 series are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016 is the Organizational management guidance for profiles described in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through Organizational Management, Project Portfolio Management, Resource Management and Process Management Processes. It is not intended for a VSE to use the standardized profile to implement ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016.</p>
    <p>Using ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016, a VSE can obtain benefits in the following aspects:</p>
    <p>?   multiple project execution and supervision of its performance, making sure all processes are executed according to the organizational strategy;</p>
    <p>?   continuous monitoring of the customer satisfaction;</p>
    <p>?   deployment and improvement of the organizational standard processes in all projects;</p>
    <p>?   controlled provision of required resources.</p>
