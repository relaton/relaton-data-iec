abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23008-1:2014 specifies MPEG Media Transport (MMT) technologies,
    which include a single encapsulation format, delivery protocols and signalling
    messages for transport and delivery of multimedia data over heterogeneous packet-switched
    networks for multimedia services. Types of packet-switched networks supported
    by this specification include bidirectional networks such as IP (Internet Protocol)
    networks and unidirectional networks such as digital broadcast networks (which
    may or may not use the IP).</p><p>The technologies specified by this specification
    belong to one of three functional areas of MMT: Media Processing Unit (MPU) format,
    signalling messages and delivery protocol.</p><p>Media Processing Unit format
    specifies the 'mpuf' branded ISO Based Media File Format encapsulating both timed
    and non-timed media contents. The MPU format is a self-contained ISOBMFF structure
    enabling independent consumption of media data, which hides codec specific details
    from the delivery function.</p><p>Signalling functional area specifies the formats
    of signalling messages carrying information for managing media content delivery
    and consumption, e.g. specific media locations and delivery configuration of media
    contents.</p><p>Delivery functional area specifies the payload formats that is
    independent of media and codec types, which allows fragmentation and aggregation
    of contents encapsulated as specified by this specification for delivery using
    packet-switched oriented transport protocols. The delivery functional area also
    provides an application layer transport protocol that allows for advanced delivery
    of media contents.</p>"
