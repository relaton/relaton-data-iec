abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-49:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-49:2021
    deals with the safety of electrically operated commercial appliances for keeping
    food and crockery warm, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    appliances connected between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances.<br
    />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within the scope of this standard are:<br
    />\r\n– hot cupboards, with or without heated tops;<br />\r\n– heated tops;<br
    />\r\n– heated display cases;<br />\r\n– heated crockery dispensers;<br />\r\n–
    heated tables;<br />\r\n– radiant heaters.<br />\r\nThese appliances are not intended
    for household and similar purposes. They are used for commercial purposes, processing
    of food, also in areas open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants,
    canteens, hospitals and in commercial enterprises, such as bakeries and butcheries.<br
    />\r\nThe electrical part of appliances making use of other forms of energy is
    also within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by these types of appliances.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities;<br
    />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified for pressure
    appliances.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances designed
    exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used
    in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– appliances for continuous
    mass production of food;<br />\r\n– commercial electric bains-marie (IEC 60335-2-50);<br
    />\r\n– battery-operated appliances;<br />\r\n– warming plates and similar appliances
    for household use covered by IEC 60335-2-12 used in the following environments
    by laymen: staff kitchen areas in shops, offices and other working environments,
    farm houses, hotels, motels and other residential type environments, bed and breakfast
    type environments.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) introduction of requirements
    for appliances intended for use in areas open to the public, including external
    accessible surface temperatures (Clause 1, 7.12, 11.8, Table 102);<br />\r\nc)
    exclusion of battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) clarification
    of applicable standard for appliances for use by laymen (Clause 1, 7.12);<br />\r\ne)
    relocation of cleaning instructions from 7.12.1 to 7.12;<br />\r\nf) relocation
    of 24.101 to 22.106;<br />\r\ng) conciliation of the text of IEC 60335-2-49 with
    other standards under IEC/TC61/MT32;<br />\r\nh) some notes have been converted
    to normative text, modified or deleted (Clause 1, 7.1, 7.15, 11.3, 11.7, 15.2,
    19.2, 22.101, 23.3);<br />\r\ni) additional requirements for measurement of input
    current;<br />\r\nj) clarification of the testing procedure in 15.1.1;<br />\r\nk)
    clarification of the test conditions in 20.1 and 23.3;<br />\r\nl) clarifications
    of the requirements in 25.3.<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction
