abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 61292-6:2023 is available as IEC TR 61292-6:2023 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC TR 61292-6:2023
    which is a Technical Report, relates to distributed Raman amplification (DRA).
    Its main purpose is to provide background material for future standards related
    to DRA, such as specifications, test methods and operating procedures. This document
    covers the following aspects:<br />\r\n- general overview of Raman amplification;<br
    />\r\n- applications of DRA;<br />\r\n- performance characteristics and test methods
    related to DRA;<br />\r\n- operational issues relating to the deployment of DRA.<br
    />\r\nAs DRA is a relatively new technology, and still rapidly evolving, some
    of the material in this document can become obsolete or irrelevant in a fairly
    short period of time. This document will be updated frequently to minimize this
    possibility. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- correction of the formula for noise figure;<br />\r\n- correction of errors
    in Figure 10."
