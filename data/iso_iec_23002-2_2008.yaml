abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23002-2:2008 specifies a particular implementation of an integer-output
    8x8 inverse discrete cosine transform (IDCT) that fully conforms to the accuracy
    requirements specified in ISO/IEC 23002-1 and additionally meets or exceeds all
    accuracy requirements specified for IDCT precision in a number of international
    video coding standards. It additionally provides a (non-normative) specification
    of an integer-output 8x8 forward DCT based on the same factorization structure.
