  content: IEC 61000-4-34:2005+AMD1:2009+AMD2:2025 CSV defines the immunity test methods
    and range of preferred test levels for electrical and electronic equipment connected
    to low-voltage power supply networks for voltage dips, short interruptions, and
    voltage variations. This standard applies to electrical and electronic equipment
    having a rated input current exceeding 16 A per phase. It covers equipment installed
    in residential areas as well as industrial machinery, specifically voltage dips
    and short interruptions for equipment connected to either 50 Hz or 60 Hz a.c.
    networks, including 1-phase and 3-phase mains. The object of this standard is
    to establish a common reference for evaluating the immunity of electrical and
    electronic equipment when subjected to voltage dips, short interruptions and voltage
    variations. The test method documented in this part of IEC 61000 describes a consistent
    method to assess the immunity of equipment or a system against a defined phenomenon.
    It has the status of a Basic EMC Publication in accordance with IEC Guide 107.
