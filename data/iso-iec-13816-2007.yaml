    <p>ISO/IEC 13816:2007 specifies syntax and semantics of the computer programming language ISLisp by specifying requirements for a conforming ISLisp processor and a conforming ISLisp text. The design goals for ISLisp are the following. </p>
    <ol>
    <li>ISLisp shall be compatible with existing Lisp dialects where feasible. </li>
    <li>ISLisp shall have as a primary goal to provide basic functionality. </li>
    <li>ISLisp shall be object-oriented. </li>
    <li>ISLisp shall be designed with extensibility in mind. </li>
    <li>ISLisp shall give priority to industrial needs over academic needs. </li>
    <li>ISLisp shall promote efficient implementations and applications. </li>
    </ol>
    <p>ISO/IEC 13816:2007 does not specify: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>the size or complexity of an ISLisp text that exceeds the capacity of any specific data processing system or the capacity of a particular processor, nor the actions to be taken when the corresponding limits are exceeded; </li>
    <li>the minimal requirements of a data processing system that is capable of supporting an implementation of a processor for ISLisp; </li>
    <li>the method of preparation of an ISLisp text for execution and the method of activation of this ISLisp text, prepared for execution; </li>
    <li>the typographical presentation of an ISLisp text published for human reading; </li>
    <li>extensions that might or might not be provided by the implementation.</li>
    </ul>
