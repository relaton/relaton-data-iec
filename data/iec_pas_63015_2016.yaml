abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63015:2016(E) provides terms and definitions for "low-halogen"
    electronic products that have the potential to contain the halogens bromine (Br)
    and chlorine (Cl) from the use of BFRs, CFRs, and PVC, and recommends methods
    for marking and labeling. This standard may be applied to all nonmetallic and
    nonceramic materials within electronic products. It establishes the maximum concentration
    level for the halogens bromine (Br) and chlorine (Cl) from the use of BFRs, CFRs,
    and PVC. While the halogen group contains fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine,
    and astatine, this document will use the term "low-halogen" to refer only to bromine
    and chlorine. Refer to Annex C for further explanation for exclusion of astatine,
    iodine and fluorine.
