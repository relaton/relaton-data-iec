abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes numbering systems that are available for the
    identification of RF tags and assigns various allocation classes to various agencies
    that issue manufacturer codes.</p><p>The unique ID can be used:</p><p>— for the
    traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in its manufacturing
    process;</p><p>— for the traceability of the RF tag during its manufacturing process
    and along its lifetime;</p><p>— for the completion of the reading in a multi-antenna
    configuration;</p><p>— by the anti-collision mechanism to inventory multiple tags
    in the reader's field of view; and</p><p>— for the traceability of the item to
    which the RF tag is attached.</p>"
