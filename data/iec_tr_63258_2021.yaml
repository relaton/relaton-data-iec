abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63258:2021 is a Technical Report focused on the practical protocol
    of ellipsometry to evaluate the thickness of nanoscale films. This document does
    not include any specification of the ellipsometers, but suggests how to minimize
    the data variation to improve data reproducibility.
