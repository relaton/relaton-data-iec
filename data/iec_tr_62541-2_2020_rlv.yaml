abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62541-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62541-2:2020
    describes the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) security model. It describes the
    security threats of the physical, hardware, and software environments in which
    OPC UA is expected to run. It describes how OPC UA relies upon other standards
    for security. It provides definition of common security terms that are used in
    this and other parts of the OPC UA specification. It gives an overview of the
    security features that are specified in other parts of the OPC UA specification.
    It references services, mappings, and Profiles that are specified normatively
    in other parts of the OPC UA Specification. It provides suggestions or best practice
    guidelines on implementing security. Any seeming ambiguity between this part and
    one of the other normative parts does not remove or reduce the requirement specified
    in the other normative part."
