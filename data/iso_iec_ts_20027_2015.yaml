abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 20027:2015 is to give guidelines to follow during the acquisition
    process of slap tenprints in order to obtain fingerprints with the best quality
    possible within acceptable time constraints.<br />\r\nNon-cooperative users are
    out of the scope of this Technical Specification.<br />\r\nWhen using ten-fingerprint
    sensors, it is fundamental to know how to use them and how to proceed during the
    acquisition. This Technical Specification describes how to capture fingerprints
    correctly by specifying best practices for slap tenprint captures.<br />\r\nIt
    gives guidance on the following topics:<br />\r\n1) recommendations on the hardware
    of the fingerprint sensor and its deployment;<br />\r\n2) recommendations on user
    guidance;<br />\r\n3) recommendations on the enrolment process including a sample
    workflow;<br />\r\n4) recommendations for developers and system integrators on
    application software;<br />\r\n5) recommendations on processing, compression and
    coding of the acquired fingerprint images;<br />\r\n6) recommendations on operational
    issues and data logging;<br />\r\n7) recommendations on the evaluation of a solution
    and its components.<br />\r\nAlthough this Technical Specification primarily focuses
    on reaching optimal data quality for enrolment purposes, the recommendations given
    here are applicable for other purposes. All processes which rely on good quality
    tenprint slaps can take advantage of the best practices reported here."
