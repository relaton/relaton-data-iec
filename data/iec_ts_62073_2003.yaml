abstract:
- content: The methods described in this technical specification can be used for the
    measurement of the wettability of the shed and housing material of composite insulators
    for overhead lines, substations and equipment or ceramic insulators covered or
    not covered by a coating. The obtained value represents the wettability at the
    time of the measurement. The determination of the ability of water to wet the
    surface of insulators may be useful to evaluate the condition of the surface of
    insulators in service, or as part of the insulator testing in the laboratory.
