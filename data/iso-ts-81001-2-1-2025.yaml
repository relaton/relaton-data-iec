  content: "This document establishes requirements and gives guidance on assurance
    case framework for healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) and for health software
    and medical device manufacturers (MDMs) and can be used to support the communication
    and information transfer between all parties. An assurance case can be used to
    communicate information and knowledge about different risks to other roles.<br
    />\r\nThis document establishes:<br />\r\n- an assurance case framework for HDOs
    and health software and MDMs for identifying, developing, interpreting, updating
    and maintaining assurance cases.<br />\r\n- one of the possible means to bridge
    the gap between manufacturers and HDOs in providing adequate information to support
    the HDOs risk management of IT-networks;<br />\r\n- best practice by leveraging
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026-2 and other standards to identify key considerations and for
    the structure and contents of an assurance case, e.g. iterative and continuous
    approaches;<br />\r\n- example structure, method and format to improve the consistency
    and comparability of assurance cases.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to
    all parties involved in the health software and health IT systems life cycle,
    including:<br />\r\na) organizations, health informatics professionals and clinical
    leaders specifying, acquiring, designing, developing, integrating, implementing
    and operating health software and health IT systems, for example health software
    developers and MDMs, system integrators, system administrators (including cloud
    and other IT service providers);<br />\r\nb) healthcare service delivery organizations,
    healthcare providers and others who use health software and health IT systems
    in providing health services;<br />\r\nc) governments, health system funders,
    monitoring agencies, professional organizations and customers seeking confidence
    in an organization’s ability to consistently provide safe, effective and secure
    health software, health IT systems and services;<br />\r\nd) organizations and
    interested parties seeking to improve communication in managing safety, effectiveness
    and security risks through a common understanding of the concepts and terminology
    used in safety, effectiveness and security management;<br />\r\ne) providers of
    training, assessment or advice in safety, effectiveness and security risk management
    for health software and health IT systems;<br />\r\nf) developers of related safety,
    effectiveness and security standards.<br />\r\nThis document is for use by organizations
    and people who build, acquire, operate, maintain, use or decommission health software
    and health IT systems (including medical devices). It is applicable to all organizations
    involved, regardless of size, complexity or business model."
