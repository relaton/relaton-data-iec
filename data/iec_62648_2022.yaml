abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC 62648:2022 is available as IEC 62648:2022 RLV which contains
    the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes of the
    technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62648:2022
    document provides guidelines to help ensure that the requirement in ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 2:2021, 28.6.2 is met, such that graphical symbols for use on equipment in
    IEC product publications are consistent with the requirements of horizontal publications
    IEC 60417, and ISO 7000. This document is intended to be used by any IEC and ISO
    committees to develop graphical symbols for use on equipment for inclusion in
    their product publications. This document is based on and develops upon IEC Guide
    108:2019, Clause 8. For the creation of new graphical symbols for use on equipment,
    IEC 80416-1 and ISO 80416 2 are applied. For the application of standardized graphical
    symbols for use on equipment, IEC 80416-3 and ISO 80416-4 are applied. This horizontal
    publication is primarily intended for use by committees in the preparation of
    publications in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 108. One
    of the responsibilities of a committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of
    horizontal publications in the preparation of its publications. The contents of
    this horizontal publication will not apply unless specifically referred to or
    included in the relevant publications. IEC 62648:2022 cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2012 and Amendment 1:2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) new terms and definitions
    in IEC Guide 108 have been incorporated;<br />\r\nb) the designation \"IEC 60417
    SDB\" has been introduced following the publication of IEC Supplement:2022, Annex
    SK;<br />\r\nc) Subclause 6.3 has been adapted in line with IEC Guide 108:2019,
    Clause 8."
