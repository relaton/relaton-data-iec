abstract:
- content: "IEC 62648:2022 document provides guidelines to help ensure that the requirement
    in ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2021, 28.6.2 is met, such that graphical symbols
    for use on equipment in IEC product publications are consistent with the requirements
    of horizontal publications IEC 60417, and ISO 7000. This document is intended
    to be used by any IEC and ISO committees to develop graphical symbols for use
    on equipment for inclusion in their product publications. This document is based
    on and develops upon IEC Guide 108:2019, Clause 8. For the creation of new graphical
    symbols for use on equipment, IEC 80416-1 and ISO 80416 2 are applied. For the
    application of standardized graphical symbols for use on equipment, IEC 80416-3
    and ISO 80416-4 are applied. This horizontal publication is primarily intended
    for use by committees in the preparation of publications in accordance with the
    principles laid down in IEC Guide 108. One of the responsibilities of a committee
    is, wherever applicable, to make use of horizontal publications in the preparation
    of its publications. The contents of this horizontal publication will not apply
    unless specifically referred to or included in the relevant publications. IEC
    62648:2022 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012 and Amendment
    1:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) new terms and definitions in IEC Guide 108 have been incorporated;<br
    />\r\nb) the designation \"IEC 60417 SDB\" has been introduced following the publication
    of IEC Supplement:2022, Annex SK;<br />\r\nc) Subclause 6.3 has been adapted in
    line with IEC Guide 108:2019, Clause 8."
