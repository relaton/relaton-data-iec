    <p>ISO/IEC 29197:2015 addresses</p>
    <p>?   fundamental requirements for planning and execution of environmental performance evaluations for biometric systems based on scenario and operational test methodologies,</p>
    <p>?   specifications to define, establish, and measure specific conditions to assess, including requirements for equipment,</p>
    <p>?   requirements for establishing a baseline performance in order to compare the influence of environmental parameters,</p>
    <p>?   a specification of the biometric evaluation including requirements for test population, test protocols, data to record, and test results, and</p>
    <p>?   procedures for carrying out the overall evaluation.</p>
    <p>It does not</p>
    <p>?   determine which parameters should be analysed for a specific biometric modality (This is currently covered in ISO/IEC/TR 19795‑3.),</p>
    <p>?   specify requirements to perform a vulnerability analysis modifying environmental factors (This is covered by ISO/IEC 19792.),</p>
    <p>?   classify biometric systems upon performance against different environmental conditions, or</p>
    <p>?   specify requirements for determining the functional effects of environmental conditions on hardware components (such as corrosion, electrical interference, breakage, etc.) of biometric systems.</p>
