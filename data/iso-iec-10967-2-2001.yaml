    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10967 de_nes the properties of numerical approximations for many of the</p>
    <p>real elementary numerical functions available in standard libraries for a variety of programming</p>
    <p>languages in common use for mathematical and numerical applications.</p>
    <p>An implementor may choose any combination of hardware and software support to meet the</p>
    <p>speci_cations of this part. It is the computing environment, as seen by the programmer/user, that</p>
    <p>does or does not conform to the speci_cations.</p>
    <p>The term implementation (of this part) denotes the total computing environment pertinent</p>
    <p>to this part, including hardware, language processors, subroutine libraries, exception handling</p>
    <p>facilities, other software, and documentation.</p>
