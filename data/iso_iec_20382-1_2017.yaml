abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 20382-1:2017 specifies face-to-face speech translation designed
    to interoperate among multiple translation systems with different languages. It
    also specifies the speech translation features, general requirements and functionality,
    thus providing a framework to support a convenient speech translation service
    in face-to-face situations. ISO/IEC 20382-1:2017 is applicable to user interfaces
    for speech translation and communication protocols for setting up a translation
    session among users. ISO/IEC 20382-1:2017 is not applicable to defining the speech
    translation engine itself.</p>"
