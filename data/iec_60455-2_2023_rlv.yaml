- content: "IEC 60455-2:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60455-2:2023
    specifies methods of test to be used for testing resin based reactive compounds,
    their components and cured compounds used for electrical insulation. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Introduction
    of test methods related to IEC 60455-3-8;<br />\r\nb) Additional and updated test
    methods for resins."
