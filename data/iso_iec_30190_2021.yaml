abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm recordable optical disk with a capacity of 25,0 Gbytes or 50,0 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. User data can be written once and read many times using
    a non-reversible method. This disk is identified as BD recordable disk.</p><p>This
    document specifies the following:</p><p>— three related but different types of
    this disk;</p><p>— the conditions for conformance;</p><p>— the environments in
    which the disk is to be operated and stored;</p><p>— the mechanical and physical
    characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data
    processing systems;</p><p>— the format of the information on the disk, including
    the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors;</p><p>— the error-correcting
    codes and the coding method used;</p><p>— the characteristics of the signals recorded
    on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</p><p>This
    document provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with
    a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems.</p>"
