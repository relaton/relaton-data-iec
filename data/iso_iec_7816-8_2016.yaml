- content: "<p>ISO 7816-8:2016 specifies interindustry commands that may be used for
    security operations. This document also provides informative directives on how
    to construct security mechanisms with ISO/IEC 7816â€‘4 defined commands.</p><p>The
    choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanism in security operations
    may affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of algorithms
    and protocols is outside the scope of this document. It does not cover the internal
    implementation within the card and/or the outside world.</p>"
