  content: "IEC 60749-23:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60749-23:2025
    specifies the test used to determine the effects of bias conditions and temperature
    on solid state devices over time. It simulates the device operating condition
    in an accelerated way and is primarily for device qualification and reliability
    monitoring. A form of high temperature bias life using a short duration, popularly
    known as \"burn-in\", can be used to screen for infant-mortality related failures.
    The detailed use and application of burn-in is outside the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) absolute stress test definitions and resultant
    test durations have been updated."
