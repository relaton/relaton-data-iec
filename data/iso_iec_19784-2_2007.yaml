abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19784-2:2007 defines the interface between a biometric service
    provider (BSP) and a biometric archive function provider (BAFP) for BioAPI. A
    BAFP encapsulates all functionality for the storage, search and management of
    biometric reference data regardless of the kind of physical storage media. Using
    a BAFP, a BSP does not have to provide special handling of different storage media
    like database servers, smartcards, database web services, etc. Whatever media
    is used, the BSP in all cases handles the same interface for a BAFP.The interface
    description contains management functions to attach and detach different BAFPs,
    to query biometric data records and to store biometric data records.
