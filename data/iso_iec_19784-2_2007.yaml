abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 19784-2:2007 defines the
    interface between a biometric service provider (BSP) and a biometric archive function
    provider (BAFP) for BioAPI. A BAFP encapsulates all functionality for the storage,
    search and management of biometric reference data regardless of the kind of physical
    storage media. Using a BAFP, a BSP does not have to provide special handling of
    different storage media like database servers, smartcards, database web services,
    etc. Whatever media is used, the BSP in all cases handles the same interface for
    a BAFP.</p><p>The interface description contains management functions to attach
    and detach different BAFPs, to query biometric data records and to store biometric
    data records.</p>
