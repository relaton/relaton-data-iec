  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 27003:2010 focuses on the critical aspects needed for successful
    design and implementation of an Information Security Management System (ISMS)
    in accordance with ISO/IEC 27001:2005. It describes the process of ISMS specification
    and design from inception to the production of implementation plans. It describes
    the process of obtaining management approval to implement an ISMS, defines a project
    to implement an ISMS (referred to in ISO/IEC 27003:2010 as the ISMS project),
    and provides guidance on how to plan the ISMS project, resulting in a final ISMS
    project implementation plan.</p>"
