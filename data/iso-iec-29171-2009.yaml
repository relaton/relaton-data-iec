    <p>ISO/IEC 29171:2009 specifies the dimensional, mechanical and physical characteristics of an information Versatile Disk for Removable usage (iVDR) cartridge to enable mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems. An iVDR cartridge can contain hard disk drive technology or other suitable storage technologies. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29171:2009 specifies the environment in which iVDR cartridges are to be operated and stored, and specifies the dimensions and pin assignments of a connector employed by iVDR cartridges to enable data interchange. </p>
    <p>Together with ISO/IEC 24739-3 and a standard for volume and file structure, ISO/IEC 29171:2009 enables full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
