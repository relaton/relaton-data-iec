abstract:
- content: This document defines a storage format for timed metadata. The timed metadata
    can be associated with other tracks in the ISO base media file format. Timed metadata
    such as quality and power consumption information and their metrics are defined
    in this part for carriage in files based on the ISO base media file format (ISO/IEC
    14496-12). The timed metadata can be used for multiple purposes including supporting
    dynamic adaptive streaming.
