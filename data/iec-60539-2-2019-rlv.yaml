  content: "IEC 60539-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60539-2:2019
    is applicable to surface mount directly heated negative temperature coefficient
    thermistors, typically made from transition metal oxide materials with semiconducting
    properties. These thermistors have metallized connecting pads or soldering strips
    and are intended to be mounted directly on to substrates for hybrid circuits or
    on to printed boards.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision for
    the structure in accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2016 (seventh edition)
    to the extent practicable, and for harmonizing with IEC 60539-1:2016;<br />\r\nb)
    the upper category temperatures of 175 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C, 315 °C, 400 °C in Table
    1 have been added;<br />\r\nc) the dimensions of 0402M in Annex A have been added."
