abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of
    a 3,81 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to enable physical interchangeability of
    such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the recording method and the recorded format - called Digital Data Storage
    4 (DDS-4) - thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such
    magnetic tape cartridges.<br />\r\nInformation interchange between systems also
    requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange
    code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information
    on the interchanged cartridge.<br />\r\nUnder information interchange circumstances
    in which a processing algorithm, e.g. for lossless data compression as specified
    in ISO/IEC 11558, is applied to the host data prior to recording on the tape and
    a complementary reprocessing algorithm is applied after the data is read from
    the tape, agreement upon these by the interchange parties is also required."
