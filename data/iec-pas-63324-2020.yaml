  content: IEC PAS 63324:2020(E) This Book 10 defines interfaces between LED Modules,
    associate components (Holders) and luminaires. Not all interface descriptions
    are applicable to LED Modules or Holders, but where applicable they are identical.
    This Book 1 defines the common concepts that underlie the Zhaga interface specifications.
    In addition, this Book 1 specifies general requirements for Zhaga compliant components
    of LED Luminaires.
