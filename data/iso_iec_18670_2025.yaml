abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This specification defines a standard data format
    for referencing software artifacts that match the data model of modern distributed
    version control systems.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This format includes the typical
    tree-like structure of a filesystem hierarchy, but also, special nodes to track
    revisions and releases, as well as the full status of a version control system,
    with all its development branches.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">A key property of
    SWHIDs is that they can be computed using cryptographically strong functions directly
    from the digital objects they refer to, by anyone that has access to a copy of
    those objects. This enables decentralised and independent verification of integrity,
    without relying on a registry or a central authority.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The
    computation of the SWHID identifiers is based on Merkle Acyclic Directed Graphs,
    a natural generalization of Merkle trees.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The resolution
    of SWHIDs, that is, the process of obtaining a copy of a digital artifact corresponding
    to a given SWHID, is outside the scope of this specification.</p>
