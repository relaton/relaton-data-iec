  content: IEC TR 61243-6:2017(E) is applicable to portable <em>non-contact voltage
    detectors</em> (NCVD) with built-in power source, to be used to indicate the presence
    or the absence of the <em>operating voltage </em>on electrical systems for <em>nominal
    voltage</em>s above 1 kV AC and frequencies of 16 2/3 Hz, 50 Hz and/or 60 Hz.
    This document describes only devices, and their behaviour, using electric field
    and voltage gradient detection principles even if other principles could be used.
    It provides performance guidelines, recommendations for use and recommended minimum
    criteria for selection.
