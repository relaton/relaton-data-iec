abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-12:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-12:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-12:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric warming plates, warming trays and similar appliances intended to keep
    food or vessels warm, for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and
    battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances intended for normal household
    and similar use and that can also be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry
    and on farms are within the scope of this standard. However, if the appliance
    is intended to be used professionally to keep vessels warm or to process food
    for commercial consumption, the appliance is not considered to be for household
    and similar use only.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n–
    for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or in aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances made of flexible material, such
    as textile material;<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively to be used in
    locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– appliances intended
    exclusively for commercial catering (IEC 60335 2 49, IEC 60335 2 50);<br />\r\n–
    appliances intended exclusively industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– warming cabinets.<br
    />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2002,
    Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 7.12, 15.2, 15.101,
    24.1.5);<br />\r\nc) application of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br
    />\r\nd) clarification of applicability of requirements for remote operation (22.40,
    22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest
    edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in
    that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established
    on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
