    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines structures and data elements for biometric information records (BIRs).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the concept of a domain of use to establish the applicability of a standard or specification that complies with CBEFF requirements.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the concept of a CBEFF patron format, which is a published BIR format specification that complies with CBEFF requirements, specified by a CBEFF patron.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the abstract values (and associated semantics) of a set of CBEFF data elements to be used in the definition of CBEFF patron formats.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 specifies the use of CBEFF data elements by a CBEFF patron to define the content and encoding of a standard biometric header (SBH) to be included in a biometric information record (i.e. the definition of a CBEFF patron format).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 provides the means for identification of the formats of the BDBs in a BIR but the standardization and interoperability of BDB formats are not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785. It also provides a means (the security block) for BIRs to carry information about the encryption of a BDB in the BIR and about integrity mechanisms applied to the BIR as a whole; the structure and content of security blocks are not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785. Further, the specification of encryption mechanisms for BDBs and of integrity mechanisms for BIRs is not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 specifies transformations from one CBEFF patron format to a different CBEFF patron format.</p>
    <p>The encoding of the abstract values of CBEFF data elements to be used in the specification of CBEFF patron formats is not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-3 specifies several patron format specifications for which ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37 is the CBEFF patron.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19785-4 specifies several security block format specifications for which ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37 is the CBEFF patron.</p>
    <p>Protection of the privacy of individuals from inappropriate dissemination and use of biometric data is not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785 but may be subject to national regulation.</p>
