  content: "<p>This Guide establishes basic safety principles for technical bodies
    preparing national and international standards for products which are intended
    specifically for use by children; these principles should also apply to products
    with which children are likely to come into contact. The following aspects are
    considered: ergonomic considerations, toxicity, flammability and thermal injuries,
    ingestion and inhalation of foreign bodies, mechanical hazards and construction
    features, electrical safety, radiation, marking and labelling, packaging, marketing.
    Annex A includes a list of possible preventive measures for specific types of
    product-related accidents.</p>"
