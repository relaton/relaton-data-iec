    <p>This document integrates many different types of audio coding: natural sound with synthetic sound, low bitrate delivery with high-quality delivery, speech with music, complex soundtracks with simple ones, and traditional content with interactive and virtual-reality content.  This document standardizes individually sophisticated coding tools to provide a novel, flexible framework for audio synchronization, mixing, and downloaded post-production.</p>
    <p>This document does not target a single application such as real-time telephony or high-quality audio compression.  Rather, it applies to <i>every</i> application requiring the use of advanced sound compression, synthesis, manipulation, or playback.  This document specifies the state-of-the-art coding tools in several domains.  As the tools it defines are integrated with the rest of the ISO/IEC 14496 series, exciting new possibilities for object-based audio coding, interactive presentation, dynamic soundtracks, and other sorts of new media, are enabled.</p>
