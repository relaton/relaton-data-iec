abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-119:2021+AMD:2025 CSV deals with the safety of commercial
    electric packaging appliances using vacuum conditions for food preservation, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V
    for other appliances.<br />\r\nThese appliances are not intended for household
    and similar purposes. They are used for commercial preservation of food in areas
    not open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens, hospitals
    and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries.<br />\r\nExamples
    of appliances that are within the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n– chamber
    vacuum packaging appliances;<br />\r\n– vacuum packaging appliances.<br />\r\nThese
    appliances may be provided with a film-sealing function.<br />\r\nThis standard
    also deals with the hygiene aspects of appliances.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by users. However, in general, it does not consider young children playing with
    the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or onboard ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    may be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements for appliances
    incorporating pressure vessels are specified;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n–
    appliances which operate with injection in the vacuum chamber of inert gas with
    an oxygen content exceeding 21 %;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in
    locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– vacuum packaging appliances
    for household and similar use (IEC 60335-2-45);<br />\r\n– battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
