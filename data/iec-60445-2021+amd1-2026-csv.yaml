  content: "IEC 60445:2021+AMD1:2026 CSV applies to the identification and marking
    of terminals of electrical equipment such as resistors, fuses, relays, contactors,
    transformers, rotating machines and, wherever applicable, to combinations of such
    equipment (e.g. assemblies), and also applies to the identification of terminations
    of certain designated conductors. It also provides general rules for the use of
    certain colours or alphanumeric notations to identify conductors with the aim
    of avoiding ambiguity and ensuring safe operation. These conductor colours or
    alphanumeric notations are intended to be applied in cables or cores, busbars,
    electrical equipment and installations. This basic safety publication is primarily
    intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards in accordance
    with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. It has the
    status of a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\nIEC
    60445:2021 cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the definitions have been aligned with IEC 60050-195:2021 and IEC 60050-826;<br
    />\r\nb) the provisions for colour to be used for identification of certain designated
    conductors are made requirements and not only recommendations;<br />\r\nc) introduction
    of a new subclause on marking of protective terminals for multiple power supply
    inputs on equipment."
