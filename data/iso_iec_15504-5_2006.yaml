abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2006 describes an exemplar Process Assessment Model
    (PAM), conformant with the ISO/IEC 15504-2 requirements for PAMs. It provides
    guidance, by way of example, on the nature and structure of PAMs, and on the variety
    and function of different indicators of process performance and capability. It
    also provides guidance, through example, on the requirements for conformance of
    PAMs, and on the approaches for demonstration of conformance.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15504
    provides a framework for the assessment of process capability. This framework
    can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring, controlling
    and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution and support
    of products and services. It is also intended for use by assessors in the performance
    of process assessment, and by organizations involved in the development of process
    reference models, process assessment models or process assessment processes.</p>"
