    This technical report has been developed to facilitate the production, supply and use of semiconductor die products, including wafers; singulated bare die; die and wafers with attached connection structures; minimally or partially encapsulated die and wafers.
    This report contains a questionnaire, based on the requirements of other parts of IEC 62258, which may be used in negotiations and contracts between suppliers and purchasers of die devices. It is intended to assist all those involved in the supply chain for die devices to comply with the requirements of the IEC 62258-1 and IEC 62258-2 standards.
