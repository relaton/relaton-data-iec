  content: "IEC 62047-4:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62047-4:2026
    describes generic specifications for micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) made
    by semiconductors, which are the basis for specifications given in other parts
    of this series for various types of MEMS applications such as sensors, RF MEMS,
    optical MEMS, bio-MEMS, micro TAS, and power MEMS. This document specifies general
    procedures for quality assessment and establishes general principles for describing
    and testing of electrical, optical, mechanical and environmental characteristics.
    This part of IEC 62047 aids in the preparation of standards that define devices
    and systems made by micromachining technology, including but not limited to, material
    characterization and handling, assembly and testing, process control and measuring
    methods. MEMS described in this document are basically made of semiconductor material.
    However, the statements made in this document are also applicable to MEMS using
    materials other than semiconductor, for example, polymers, glass, metals and ceramic
    materials.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) in the Scope, optical
    MEMS, bio-MEMS, micro TAS, and power MEMS for various types of MEMS applications
    were included;<br />\r\nb) MEMS categories and terms in Table 1 were slightly
    modified such consumer electronics and automotive were added that in application
    technology."
