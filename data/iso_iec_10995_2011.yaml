- content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 10995:2011 specifies an
    accelerated aging test method for estimating the life expectancy for the retrievability
    of information stored on recordable or rewritable optical disks.</p><p>This test
    includes details on the following formats: DVD-R/-RW/-RAM, +R/+RW. It can be applied
    to additional optical disk formats with the appropriate specification substitutions
    and can be updated in the future as required.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10995:2011 includes</p><p>-
    stress conditions,</p><p>- assumptions,</p><p>- ambient conditions: controlled
    storage conditions, e.g. 25 °C and 50 % RH, using the Eyring model; and uncontrolled
    storage conditions, e.g. 30 °C and 80 % RH, using the Arrhenius model,</p><p>-
    evaluation system description,</p><p>- specimen preparation,</p><p>- data acquisition
