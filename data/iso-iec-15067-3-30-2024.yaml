  content: "ISO/IEC 15067-3-30:2024 specifies functional requirements and reference
    interfaces for interconnected energy management agents (EMAs) based on the model
    for an EMA specified in ISO/IEC 15067-3 and the model for multiple interacting
    EMAs specified in ISO/IEC 15067-3-3. This specification supports energy management
    by facilitating interactions and information exchange among EMAs and appliances,
    consumer electronics, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment,
    water heaters, distributed energy resources (DERs), electric vehicle (EV) chargers,
    and other loads supplied by public and local power sources in a house or an apartment
    complex. Local power sources can use DER, which can include, but are not limited
    to, wind turbines, solar panels, and storage (stationary and mobile). EMAs specified
    with these functions and interfaces can assist the consumer in responding to price-varying
    public power and buying or selling transactive energy (TE).<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies framework methods for EMAs to co-ordinate the delivery of energy management
    applications, and the reference interfaces facilitate a communications protocol
    among interacting EMAs. These linked and interacting EMAs provide energy optimization
    and conservation within constraints such as a consumer's financial budget and
    goals for greenhouse gas reduction, while supporting programmes as diverse as
    TE and demand response (DR)."
