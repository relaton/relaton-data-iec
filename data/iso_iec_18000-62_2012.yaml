abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000-62:2012 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 960 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and
    Medical (ISM) band used in item management applications. It provides a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. It is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage
    inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international
    marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes
    including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy,
    occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP),
    spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy,
    bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency
    hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines
    the communications protocol used in the air interface.ISO/IEC 18000-62:2012 specifies
    the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter, Interrogator-Talks-First
    (ITF) systems. The system comprises Interrogators, also known as readers, and
    tags, also known as labels. An Interrogator receives information from a tag by
    transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag responds by
    modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering an
    information signal to the Interrogator. The system is ITF, meaning that a tag
    modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal only after
    being directed to do so by an Interrogator.ISO/IEC 18000-62:2012 contains Type
    B.Type B uses Manchester in the forward link and an adaptive binary-tree collision-arbitration
    algorithm. ISO/IEC 18000-62:2012 specifies physical interactions (the signalling
    layer of the communication link) between Interrogators and tags, Interrogator
    and tag operating procedures and commands, the collision arbitration scheme used
    to identify a specific tag in a multiple-tag environment.
