abstract:
- content: "IEC 62619:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62619:2022 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62619:2017
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 21A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62619:2022 specifies requirements and tests for the safe operation
    of secondary lithium cells and batteries used in industrial applications, including
    stationary applications. When there exists an IEC International Standard specifying
    test conditions and requirements for cells used in special applications and which
    is in conflict with this document, the former takes precedence (e.g., IEC 62660
    series on road vehicles). The following are some examples of applications that
    utilize cells and batteries under the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- Stationary
    applications: telecom, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS), electrical energy
    storage system, utility switching, emergency power, and similar applications.<br
    />\r\n- Motive applications: forklift truck, golf cart, automated guided vehicle
    (AGV), railway vehicles, and marine vehicles, with the exception of road vehicles."
