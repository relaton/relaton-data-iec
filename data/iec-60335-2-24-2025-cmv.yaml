  content: "IEC 60335-2-24:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-24:2025 edition 9.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-24:2020
    edition 8.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 61C experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-24:2025 deals with the safety of the following appliances,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances, 480
    V for other appliances and 24 V DC for appliances when battery-operated:<br />\r\n–
    refrigerating appliances for household and similar use;<br />\r\n– ice-makers
    incorporating a motor-compressor and ice-makers intended to be incorporated in
    frozen food storage compartments intended for household use;<br />\r\n– refrigerating
    appliances and ice-makers for applications similar to household use such as for
    camping, in leisure accommodation vehicles, on boats for leisure purposes and
    on board ships;<br />\r\n– mobile refrigerating appliances.<br />\r\nThese appliances
    can be operated from the mains, from a separable battery or operated either from
    the mains or from a separable battery or from other sources of energy (gas, liquid
    and solid fuel).<br />\r\nThis standard deals also with refrigerating appliances
    intended for the use on boats for leisure purposes and on board ships, for which
    the normative Annex FF is applicable.<br />\r\nThis standard also deals with the
    safety of ice-cream appliances intended for household use, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.<br
    />\r\nIt also deals with compression-type appliances for household and similar
    use, which use flammable refrigerants.<br />\r\nThis standard does not cover features
    of the construction and operation of those refrigerating appliances which are
    dealt with in other IEC standards.<br />\r\nRefrigerating appliances not intended
    for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the
    public, such as<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances used in staff kitchen areas
    in shops, offices and other working environments,<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances
    used in farm houses and by clients in hotels, motels and other residential type
    environments,<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances used in bed and breakfast type
    environments, and<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances used in catering and similar
    non-retail applications<br />\r\nare within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account persons whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn
    to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles, leisure
    accommodation vehicles, boats for leisure purposes, on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\n– for appliances that are operated additional
    from other sources of energy (gas, liquid and solid fuel), additional requirements
    can be necessary.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended for outdoor use, except for mobile refrigerating appliances;<br />\r\n–
    appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n–
    appliances incorporating a battery intended as a power supply for the refrigerating
    function;<br />\r\n– appliances assembled on site by the installer;<br />\r\n–
    appliances with remote motor-compressors;<br />\r\n– motor-compressors (IEC 60335-2-34);<br
    />\r\n– commercial dispensing appliances and vending appliances (IEC 60335-2-75);<br
    />\r\n– commercial refrigerating appliances and ice-makers with an incorporated
    or remote refrigerant unit or motor-compressor (IEC 60335-2-89);<br />\r\n– professional
    ice-cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118).<br />\r\nThis ninth edition cancels and replaces
    the eighth edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) aligns the text with IEC 60335 1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) new probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 8.1.3, 20.2);<br />\r\nc) new
    exception for components inside the thermal insulation has been introduced (22.117);<br
    />\r\nd) new requirement for mobile refrigerating appliances, appliances to be
    used in leisure accommodation vehicles like motor caravans, boats for leisure
    purposes and appliances to be used on board ships has been introduced (Clause
    1, 3.5.107, 3.5.108, 7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.14, 19.103, 21.101, 24.3, Annex FF);<br
    />\r\ne) text in 3.1.9.101, 3.1.9.102, 3.1.9.103 and 3.1.9.104 has been cancelled
    and the text copied in 5.104;<br />\r\nf) new requirement for the evaluation of
    non-dangerous moving parts has been introduced (20.2);<br />\r\ng) new abnormal
    test has been introduced (19.106);<br />\r\nh) reference to flammable refrigerant
    has been deleted (22.7);<br />\r\ni) new subclauses have been added (22.40, 22.49,
    22.51);<br />\r\nj) requirement for the evaluation of motor-compressor has been
    updated (24.1);<br />\r\nk) Annex DD has been cancelled and the text copied to
    Annex A;<br />\r\nl) design pressure has been changed in maximum allowable pressure
    (3.8.101).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335 1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
