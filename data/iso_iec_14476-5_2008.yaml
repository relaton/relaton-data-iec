abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14476-5:2008 defines a protocol for N-plex multicast transport
    over the Internet where IP multicast is supported. It provides the mechanisms
    of session control and error control. For session control, one participant is
    designated to manage creation/termination of a connection; join/leave of a participant;
    and tokens which allow the specific participants to send data. For error control,
    it provides the mechanisms of tree-based loss recovery; control tree construction
    with two-layer logical tree; and logical tree adaptation with packet delivery
    status. ISO/IEC 14476-5:2008 specifies the protocol details such as packet format,
    procedures, and parameter values. This protocol can be used for the applications
    which require many-to-many reliable data delivery service.
