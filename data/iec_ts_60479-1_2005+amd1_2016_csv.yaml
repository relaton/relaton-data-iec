abstract:
- content: IEC 60479-1:2005+A1:2016(E) For a given current path through the human
    body, the danger to persons depends mainly on the magnitude and duration of the
    current flow. However, the time/current zones specified in this publication are,
    in many cases, not directly applicable in practice for designing measures of protection
    against electrical shock. The necessary criterion is the admissible limit of touch
    voltage (i.e. the product of the current through the body called touch current
    and the body impedance) as a function of time. The relationship between current
    and voltage is not linear because the impedance of the human body varies with
    the touch voltage, and data on this relationship is therefore required. The different
    parts of the humanbody (such as the skin, blood, muscles, other tissues and joints)
    present to the electric current a certain impedance composed of resistive and
    capacitive components. The values of body impedance depend on a number of factors
    and, in particular, on current path, on touch voltage, duration of current flow,
    frequency, degree of moisture of the skin, surface area of contact, pressure exerted
    and temperature. The impedance values indicated in this technical specification
    result from a close examination of the experimental results available from measurements
    carried out principally on corpses and on some living persons. This technical
    specification has the status of a basic safety publication in accordance with
    IEC Guide 104. The contents of the corrigenda of October 2006 and June 2013 have
    been included in this copy.<strong>This consolidated version consists of the fourth
    edition (2005) and its amendment 1 (2016). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.</strong>
