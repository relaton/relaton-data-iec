abstract:
- content: "IEC 61400-25-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61400-25-1:2017
    gives an overall description of the principles and models used in the IEC 61400­25
    series, which is designed for a communication environment supported by a client-server
    model. Three areas are defined, that are modelled separately to ensure the scalability
    of implementations: wind power plant information models, information exchange
    model, and mapping of these two models to a standard communication profile. This
    new edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition: general harmonization of text and overview models with
    the other parts of the IEC 61400­25 series, harmonization of definitions in other
    related standards."
