abstract:
- content: 'Defines the syntax and semantics of the Formal Description Technique LOTOS
    used for the formal description of distributed, concurrent information processing
    systems. LOTOS can be used to describe formally the service definitions and protocol
    specifications of the layers of Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) architecture
    described in ISO 7498, and related standards, and conformance tests for implementations
    of OSI protocols and/or OSI functions. It can also be applied for the formal description
    of other distributed systems, such as telephone switching networks. References:
    ISO 7498; CCITT Recommendation Z. 100, SDL.'
