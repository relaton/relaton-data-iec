abstract:
- content: "<p>The standard establishes a set of processes by which engineers and
    technologists can include consideration of ethical values throughout the stages
    of concept exploration and development, which encompass system initiation, analysis,
    and design. This standard provides engineers and technologists with an implementable
    process aligning innovation management processes, system design approaches, and
    software engineering methods to help address ethical concerns or risks during
    system design.</p><p>IEEE Std 7000â„¢ does not give specific guidance on the design
    of algorithms to apply ethical values such as fairness and privacy.</p>"
