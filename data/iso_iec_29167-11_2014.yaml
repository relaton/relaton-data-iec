    ISO/IEC 29167-11:2014 defines the crypto suite for PRESENT-80 for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interface standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices. The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices that may be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and application standards.

    PRESENT-80 is a symmetric block cipher that can process data blocks of 64 bits, using a key length of 80 bits. ISO/IEC 29167-11:2014 defines various authentication methods and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag and an Interrogator may support one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported.
