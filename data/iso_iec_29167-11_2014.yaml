abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29167-11:2014 defines the crypto suite for PRESENT-80 for the
    ISO/IEC 18000 air interface standards for radio frequency identification (RFID)
    devices. The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.
    Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices
    that may be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and application
    standards.</p><p>PRESENT-80 is a symmetric block cipher that can process data
    blocks of 64 bits, using a key length of 80 bits. ISO/IEC 29167-11:2014 defines
    various authentication methods and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag and an
    Interrogator may support one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly
    stating what is supported.</p>"
