  content: "IEC 60335-2-90:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-90:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/61880\">IEC 60335-1:2020</a>.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-90:2024 deals with:<br />\r\n- the safety of microwave
    ovens with a cavity door intended for commercial use, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase and
    neutral and 480 V for other appliances.<br />\r\nThese appliances are not intended
    for household and similar purposes. They are used for commercial processing of
    food, also in areas open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants,
    canteens, hospitals and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries;<br
    />\r\n- the safety of combination microwave ovens with a cavity door, the requirements
    of which are contained in normative Annex AA;<br />\r\n- the safety of microwave
    ovens without a cavity door and with transportation means that are intended for
    commercial use only, for the heating of food and beverages, the requirements of
    which are contained in normative Annex BB.<br />\r\nMicrowave ovens covered by
    normative Annex BB have transportation means for moving the load through the microwave
    oven. Requirements for tunnel microwave ovens and several types of microwave vending
    machines are covered.<br />\r\nThis standard also deals with microwave ovens intended
    to be used on board ships, for which normative Annex EE is applicable.<br />\r\nIn
    normative Annex BB, a microwave oven without a cavity door and with transportation
    means is described as a microwave oven. All clauses of this standard apply to
    these appliances unless otherwise specified in normative Annex BB.<br />\r\nThis
    part of IEC 60335 also takes into account ordinary persons having access to the
    removing area of the vending machine.<br />\r\nThe appliance can be built into
    a vending machine, in which case IEC 60335-2-75 can also be applicable.<br />\r\nAppliances
    that use non-electrical energy are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    these types of appliances.<br />\r\nThis standard does not take into account the
    use of a microwave oven without a cavity door and with transportation means by
    ordinary persons except in the vicinity of entrance and exit ports.<br />\r\nThe
    rationales for particular microwave exposure conditions and measures related to
    microwave energy being confined by an open structure are given in normative Annex
    BB.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on trains, on board ships or board aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in
    tropical countries, special requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many
    countries, the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities specify additional requirements;<br
    />\r\n- in many countries, national authorities specify additional requirements
    to BB.22.101.1.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- Microwave
    ovens including combination microwave ovens for household use covered by IEC 60335-2-25
    and used in the following environments by laymen:<br />\r\n• staff kitchen areas
    in shops, offices and other working environments;<br />\r\n• farm houses;<br />\r\n•
    by clients in hotels, motels and other residential type environments;<br />\r\n•
    bed and breakfast type environments.<br />\r\n- industrial microwave heating equipment
    (IEC 60519-6);<br />\r\n- appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);<br />\r\n-
    appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in
    2015 including its Amendment 1:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the appliance used in area open to the public
    has been introduced in Clause 1, 3.8.107, 7.12, 8.1.1, 11.8, 20.2, 22.103.2, 22.105
    and 22.117;<br />\r\nb) Subclauses 5.5, 7.12.1, 11.2, 11.7, 20.1 and 20.101 have
    been modified to add for stacking installation;<br />\r\nc) Subclauses 7.1, 11.7
    and 22.61 have been modified for the appliance outlets and socket-outlets;<br
    />\r\nd) Subclause 7.12 has been improved in clarity;<br />\r\ne) maximum temperature
    rises of external accessible surfaces have been added in Subclause 11.8;<br />\r\nf)
    test criterion has been modified in Subclause 15.101;<br />\r\ng) Subclause 16.101
    has been modified to move the content of 16.101.1, 16.101.2 directly under 16.101.<br
    />\r\nh) Subclauses 19.11.2, 19.13, Clause 21, Subclauses 22.105, 22.111 and Annex
    AA have been improved in clarity;<br />\r\ni) Annex BB and Annex EE have been
    modified to add screw requirements.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
