abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-3-53:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-53:2020
    defines the encircled angular flux measurement of multimode waveguide light sources,
    in which most of the transverse modes are excited. The term \"waveguide\" is understood
    to include both channel waveguides and optical fibres but not slab waveguides.
    The applicable fibre types are the followings:<br />\r\n- A1 specified in IEC
    60793-2-10;<br />\r\n- A3 specified in IEC 60793-2-30;<br />\r\n- A4 specified
    in IEC 60793-2-40.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- the scope of the applicable wave guides, and graded index multimode optical
    wave guide and fibre have been included;<br />\r\n- the structure of 5.3 has been
    rearranged;<br />\r\n- Annex C and Annex D have been added.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of June 2023 have been included in this copy."
