  content: "IEC 62766-6:2017(E) specifies the procedural application environment (PAE)
    component of the OIPF terminal function (OITF). It also defines the UNI reference
    point UNIS-12 of the OIPF functional architecture summarised in Annex B of IEC
    62766-1:2017.<br />\r\nThe PAE is an application environment for IPTV services
    based on Java. Like other specifications such as OCAP, ACAP and Blu-ray, which
    are, or include, GEM terminal specifications, this document follows the structure
    of ETSI TS 102 728."
