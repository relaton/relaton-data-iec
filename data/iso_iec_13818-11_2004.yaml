abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13818-11:2004 specifies IPMP (Intellectual Property Management
    and Protection) on the MPEG-2 system. MPEG-2 IPMP offers flexibility, robustness
    and interoperability, which allows the secure content delivery in the MPEG-2 system.
    MPEG-2 IPMP can be used in combination with proprietary IPMP tools, which enables
    the implementation to various degrees of security for different business models,
    while maintaining the interoperability.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13818-11:2004 specifies:</p><ul><li>syntax
    and semantics for IPMP control information which includes tool list, tool container
    and rights container;</li><li>syntax and semantics for IPMP descriptors, which
    facilitates IPMP protection signalling;</li><li>syntax and semantics of IPMP data
    extending from the common base class IPMP_Data_BaseClass to support the following
    functionalities:<ul><li>mutual authentication for IPMP tool to IPMP tool as well
    as IPMP tool to terminal communication,</li><li>the requesting by IPMP tools of
    the connection/disconnection to requested IPMP tools,</li><li>the notification
    to IPMP tools of the connection/disconnection of IPMP tools,</li><li>common IPMP
    processing,</li><li>IPMP tool to/from user interaction;</li></ul></li><li>syntax
    and semantics for IPMP information carriage to and from IPMP tools;</li><li>syntax
    and semantics for the request and transfer of content and IPMP tools between terminals;</li><li>XML
    syntax and semantics for the description of the environment in which the MPEG-2
    terminal/application is operating;</li><li>a list of registration authorities
    required for the support of the specifications found herein.</li></ul>"
