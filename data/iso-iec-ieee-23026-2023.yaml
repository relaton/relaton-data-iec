    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document defines system engineering and management requirements for the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering, testing and validation, and management and sustainment for intranet and extranet environments. This document applies to those using web technology to present information and communications technology (ICT) information, such as information for users of systems and services, plans and reports for systems and software engineering projects, and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service management. This document provides requirements for website owners and website providers, managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development and operations, website engineers, designers, developers, and operations and maintenance staff, who can be external or internal to the website owner's organization. It applies to websites for public access and for limited access, such as for users, customers, and subscribers seeking information on IT systems, products and services.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The requirements and recommendations in this document address the following aspects of usability of informational websites and ease of maintenance of managed website operations:</span></p>
