  content: "IEC 60964:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60964:2018
    establishes requirements for the human-machine interface in the main control rooms
    of nuclear power plants. The document also establishes requirements for the selection
    of functions, design consideration and organization of the human-machine interface
    and procedures which are used systematically to verify and validate the functional
    design. These requirements reflect the application of human factors engineering
    principles as they apply to the human-machine interface during plant operational
    states and accident conditions (including design basis and design extension conditions),
    as defined in IAEA SSR-2/1 and IAEA NP-T-3.16. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) to review the usage of the term “task”
    ensuring consistency between IEC 60964 and IEC 61839;<br />\r\nb) to clarify the
    role, functional capability, robustness and integrity of supporting services for
    the MCR to promote its continued use at the time of a severe accident or extreme
    external hazard;<br />\r\nc) to review the relevance of the standard to the IAEA
    safety guides and IEC SC 45A standards that have been published since IEC 60964:2009
    was developed;<br />\r\nd) to clarify the role and meaning of “task analysis”,<br
    />\r\ne) to further delineate the relationships with derivative standards (i.e.
    IEC 61227, IEC 61771, IEC 61772, IEC 61839, IEC 62241 and others of relevance
    to the control room design);<br />\r\nf) to consider its alignment with the Human
    Factors Engineering principles, specifically with the ones of IAEA safety guide
    on Human Factors (DS-492) to be issued.</p>"
