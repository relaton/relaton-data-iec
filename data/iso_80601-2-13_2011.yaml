abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 80601-2-13:2011 is applicable to the basic safety and essential
    performance of an anaesthetic workstation for administering inhalational anaesthesia
    whilst continuously attended by a professional operator. ISO/IEC 80601-2-13:2011
    specifies particular requirements for a complete anaesthetic workstation and the
    following anaesthetic workstation components which, although considered as individual
    devices in their own right, may be utilized, in conjunction with other relevant
    anaesthetic workstation components, to form an anaesthetic workstation to a given
    specification:<br />\r\n- anaesthetic gas delivery system;<br />\r\n- anaesthetic
    breathing system;<br />\r\n- anaesthetic gas scavenging system;<br />\r\n- anaesthetic
    vapour delivery system;<br />\r\n- anaesthetic ventilator;<br />\r\n- monitoring
    equipment;<br />\r\n- alarm system;<br />\r\n- protection device.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    80601-2-13:2011 is also applicable to those accessories intended by their manufacturer
    to be connected to an anaesthetic workstation where the characteristics of those
    accessories can affect the basic safety and essential performance of the anaesthetic
    workstation. If a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable
    to anaesthetic workstation components only, the title and content of that clause
    or subclause will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies
    both to an anaesthetic workstation and its individual components, as relevant.
    Hazards inherent in the intended physiological function of an anaesthetic workstation
    and its individual components within the scope of ISO/IEC 80601-2-13:2011 are
    not covered by specific requirements in ISO/IEC 80601-2-13:2011 except in 7.2.13
    and 8.4.1 of IEC 60601-1:2005. ISO/IEC 80601-2-13:2011 is not applicable to any
    anaesthetic workstation intended for use with flammable anaesthetic agents, as
    determined by Annex BB."
