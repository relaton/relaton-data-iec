  content: "IEC 60335-2-7:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-7:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-7:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric washing machines for household and similar use, that are intended
    for washing clothes and textiles, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances. This standard
    also deals with the safety of electric washing machines for household and similar
    use employing an electrolyte instead of detergent. Appliances not intended for
    normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and
    on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by washing machines that
    are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it
    does not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose: physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br
    />\r\n- for washing machines intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships
    or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to:<br />\r\n- washing machines intended exclusively for industrial purposes (ISO
    10472-2);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- washing machines incorporating steam generating
    devices in which steam is produced at a pressure exceeding 50 kPa;<br />\r\n-
    washing machines for commercial use including those for communal use in blocks
    of flats or in launderettes (IEC 60335-2-122).<br />\r\nThis ninth edition cancels
    and replaces the eighth edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 20.104, 20.105);<br
    />\r\nc) addition of requirements for restarting the spin cycle of agitator washing
    machines and impeller washing machines (20.108);<br />\r\nd) addition of requirements
    for remote operation (22.51);<br />\r\ne) application of test probe 19 has been
    introduced (8.1.1, 20.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
