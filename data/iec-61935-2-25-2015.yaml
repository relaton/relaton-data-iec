  content: "IEC 61935-2-25:2015(E) which is a blank detail specification, describes
    work area cord with M12 4 poles d-code connectors, as used in the ISO/IEC 24702
    and IEC 61918. According to the above cabling specifications, although these cords
    have only two pairs, their transmission performances, when applicable, are at
    least category 5 compliant for which the requirements are given in ISO/IEC 11801:2002/AMD2:2010,
    Clause 13. This specification should be used in conjunction with IEC 61156-1,
    IEC 61156-6 and IEC 61076-2-101 type D. The blank detail specification determines
    the layout and style for detail specifications describing cords with transmission
    characteristics up to 100 MHz for digital communications. Detail specifications,
    based on the blank detail specification, may be prepared by a national organization,
    a manufacturer, or a user.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in
    conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4586\">IEC 61156-1:2007</a>,
