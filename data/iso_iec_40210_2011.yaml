- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    40210:2011 SOAP Version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended for exchanging
    structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It uses XML
    technologies to define an extensible messaging framework providing a message construct
    that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has
    been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other
    implementation specific semantics.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 40210:2011 defines the SOAP
    messaging framework consisting of:<br />\r\nthe SOAP processing model defining
    the rules for processing a SOAP message;<br />\r\nthe SOAP Extensibility model
    defining the concepts of SOAP features and SOAP modules;<br />\r\nthe SOAP underlying
    protocol binding framework describing the rules for defining a binding to an underlying
    protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages between SOAP nodes;<br
    />\r\nthe SOAP message construct defining the structure of a SOAP message."
