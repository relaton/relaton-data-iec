abstract:
- content: "<p>SOAP Version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight protocol intended for exchanging
    structured information in a decentralized, distributed environment. It uses XML
    technologies to define an extensible messaging framework providing a message construct
    that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying protocols. The framework has
    been designed to be independent of any particular programming model and other
    implementation specific semantics.</p><p>ISO/IEC 40210:2011 defines the SOAP messaging
    framework consisting of:</p><ul><li>the SOAP processing model defining the rules
    for processing a SOAP message;</li><li>the SOAP Extensibility model defining the
    concepts of SOAP features and SOAP modules;</li><li>the SOAP underlying protocol
    binding framework describing the rules for defining a binding to an underlying
    protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages between SOAP nodes;</li><li>the
    SOAP message construct defining the structure of a SOAP message.</li></ul>"
