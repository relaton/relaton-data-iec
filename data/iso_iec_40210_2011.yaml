abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>SOAP Version 1.2 (SOAP) is a lightweight
    protocol intended for exchanging structured information in a decentralized, distributed
    environment. It uses XML technologies to define an extensible messaging framework
    providing a message construct that can be exchanged over a variety of underlying
    protocols. The framework has been designed to be independent of any particular
    programming model and other implementation specific semantics.</p><p>ISO/IEC 40210:2011
    defines the SOAP messaging framework consisting of:</p><ul><li>the SOAP processing
    model defining the rules for processing a SOAP message;</li><li>the SOAP Extensibility
    model defining the concepts of SOAP features and SOAP modules;</li><li>the SOAP
    underlying protocol binding framework describing the rules for defining a binding
    to an underlying protocol that can be used for exchanging SOAP messages between
    SOAP nodes;</li><li>the SOAP message construct defining the structure of a SOAP
    message.</li></ul>
