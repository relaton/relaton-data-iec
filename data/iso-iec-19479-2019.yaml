    <p>This document defines a model for the recording and exchange of learner achievement information among student information systems (SIS) (also known as student management information systems), as well as the aggregation of information by third party suppliers.</p>
    <p>In addition, this document defines refinements to the learner mobility achievement award (LMAI) model for representing the digital diploma supplement (DDS).</p>
    <p>NOTE       The proposed model proposed is not intended to define the representation of the entire spectrum of learner mobility information but to define the formally structured representation of official, institutionally attested achievement information for learners engaged in formal learning processes, in order to facilitate its recording and subsequent exchange within any international area within which learner mobility is possible. Achievement information structured and presented in compliance with this document could, of course, be used for other purposes, for instance, to provide descriptions of achievement to enrich a learner-owned report in an e-portfolio. However, guidance on the document and the organisation of information for purposes other than the representation of formal achievement reports is outside the scope of this document.</p>
