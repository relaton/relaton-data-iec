abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    primary purpose of ISO/IEC 19788 is to specify metadata elements and their attributes
    for the description of learning resources. This includes the rules governing the
    identification of data elements and the specification of their attributes.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 19788-1:2011 provides data elements for the description of learning
    resources and resources directly related to learning resources.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19788-1:2011 provides principles, rules and structures for the specification of
    the description of a learning resource; it identifies and specifies the attributes
    of a data element as well as the rules governing their use. The key principles
    stated in ISO/IEC 19788-1:2011 are informed by a user requirements-driven context
    with the aim of supporting multilingual and cultural adaptability requirements
    from a global perspective.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19788-1:2011 is information-technology-neutral
    and defines a set of common approaches, i.e. methodologies and constructs, which
    apply to the development of the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 19788."
