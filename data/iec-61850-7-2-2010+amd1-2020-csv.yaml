  content: "IEC 61850-7-2:2010+A1:2020 applies to the ACSI communication for utility
    automation. The ACSI provides the following abstract communication service interfaces:<br
    />\r\n- abstract interface describing communications between a client and a remote
    server;<br />\r\n- and abstract interface for fast and reliable system-wide event
    distribution between an application in one device and many remote applications
    in different devices (publisher/sub-scriber) and for transmission of sampled measured
    values (publisher/subscriber).<br />\r\nMajor technical changes with regard to
    the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- data types not required have been
    removed,<br />\r\n- service tracking for control blocks have been added,<br />\r\n-
    security issues are solved by the IEC 62351 series,<br />\r\n- service tracking
    for control blocks have been added,<br />\r\n- the view concept will be according
    to the new work on role bases access (RBA),<br />\r\n- security issues are solved
    by the IEC 62351 series.<br />\r\nThis publication is of core relevance for Smart
    Grid. This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2010) and its
    amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
    publication."
