abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nSO/IEC
    30107-1:2016 establishes terms and definitions that are useful in the specification,
    characterization and evaluation of presentation attack detection methods.<br />\r\nOutside
    the scope are<br />\r\n- standardization of specific PAD detection methods;<br
    />\r\n- detailed information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing techniques),
    algorithms, or sensors; and<br />\r\n- overall system-level security or vulnerability
    assessment.<br />\r\nThe attacks to be considered in ISO/IEC 30107 are those that
    take place at the sensor during the presentation and collection of the biometric
    characteristics.<br />\r\nAny other attacks are considered outside the scope of
    ISO/IEC 30107."
