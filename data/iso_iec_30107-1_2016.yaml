abstract:
- content: "<p><strong>Abstract</strong>:</p><p>In recent years, there has been an
    increase in the availability and interest in using biometric sensors for authenticating
    users, but the potential for attacks on a system through the biometric sensor
    has limited the use of biometrics in applications which are unsupervised by an
    agent of the system owner, such as remote authentication over untrusted networks.
    Biometric data can be easily obtained directly from a person, online, or through
    existing databases and then used to create spoofs (or fakes) to mount an attack.
    The presentation of a biometric spoof (e.g. a facial image or video of a person
    on a tablet or a fake silicone or gelatin fingerprint) to a biometric sensor can
    be detected by methods broadly referred to as presentation attack detection, PAD.</p><p>The
    purpose of ISO/IEC 30107-1 is to provide a foundation for PAD through defining
    terms and establishing a framework through which presentation attack events can
    be specified and detected so that they can be categorized, detailed and communicated
    for subsequent decision making and performance assessment activities. This foundation
    is intended to not only introduce and frame the topics of presentation attacks
    and PAD but also to benefit other standards projects. This standard does not advocate
    a specific standard PAD method. The scope is limited to describing attacks that
    take place at the sensor during the presentation and collection of biometric characteristics.</p><p>There
    are two other parts of ISO/IEC 30107, under the general title<em>Information Technology
    - Biometric presentation attack detection</em>:</p><p>-<em>Part 2:Data Formats</em></p><p>-<em>Part
    3: Testing and reporting.</em></p><p><strong>Keywords</strong>:</p><p>Liveness,
    liveness detection, biometric liveness detection, spoof detection, biometric spoof,
    biometric spoof detection, fake, fake biometric, fake biometrics, arefact, artefact
    detection.</p><p>.</p>"
