abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19759:2005, a guide to the software engineering body of knowledge
    (SWEBOK), identifies and describes that subset of the body of knowledge that is
    generally accepted, even though software engineers must be knowledgeable not only
    in software engineering, but also, of course, in other related disciplines. SWEBOK
    is an all-inclusive term that describes the sum of knowledge within the profession
    of software engineering.
