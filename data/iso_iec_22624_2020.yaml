    including cross border data transfer, as well as remote access to data;<br />\r\n-
    provides use cases for data handling challenges, i.e. control, access and location
    of data according to ISO/IEC 19944 data categories.<br />\r\nThis document is
    applicable primarily to cloud service providers, cloud service customers (CSCs)
    and cloud service users, but also to any person or organization involved in legal,
