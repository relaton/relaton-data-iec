abstract:
- content: "IEC 60700-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60700-1:2015 applies
    to thyristor valves with metal oxide surge arresters directly connected between
    the valve terminals, for use in a line commutated converter for high voltage d.c.
    power transmission or as part of a back-to-back link. It is restricted to electrical
    type and production tests. The tests specified in this standard are based on air
    insulated valves. For other types of valves, the test requirements and acceptance
    criteria can be agreed. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) Definitions of terms
    \"redundant thyristor levels\", \"thyristor level\", \"valve section\" have been
    changed for clarification.<br />\r\nb) The notes were added to test requirements
    of dielectric d.c. voltage tests for valve support, MVU, valve, specifying that
    before repeating the test with opposite polarity, the tested object may be short-circuited
    and earthed for several hours. The same procedure may be followed at the end of
    the d.c. voltage test.<br />\r\nc) Table 1 on thyristor level faults permitted
    during type tests was supplemented.<br />\r\nd) The alternative MVU dielectric
    test method was added.<br />\r\ne) It was specified that production tests may
    include routine tests as well as sample tests.<br />\r\nf) It was added into test
    requirements for periodic firing and extinction tests that a scaling factor for
    tests shall be applied when testing with valve sections.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of January 2017 have been included in this copy."
