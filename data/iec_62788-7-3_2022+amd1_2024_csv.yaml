abstract:
- content: IEC 62788-7-3:2022+AMD1:2024 CSV defines the test methods that can be used
    for evaluating the abrasion of materials and coatings in photovoltaic modules
    or other solar devices. This document may be applied to components on the incident
    surface (including coatings, frontsheet, and glass) as well as the back surface
    (including backsheets or back glass). This document is intended to address abrasion
    of PV module surfaces and any coatings present using representative specimens
    (e.g. which can be centimetres in size); the methods and apparatus used here can
    also be used on PV module specimens (e.g. meters in size).
