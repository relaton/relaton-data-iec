abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15476-3:2006 explains the Data definitions subject area of
    the CDIF semantic metamodel, that defines the primitive data types and the objects
    which are used for structured data. The CDIF semantic metamodel is used to ensure
    that the information transferred by tools communicating using CDIF is expressed
    with an agreed meaning. This subject area contains meta-objects that are used
    as the basis of the data components of other subject area standards, and also
    meta-relationships and meta-attributes that are applicable to all data-related
    meta-objects.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15476-3:2006 is intended to be used by anyone wishing
    to understand and/or use CDIF. It provides a definition of a single subject area
    of the CDIF semantic metamodel. It is suitable for:</p><ul><li>Those evaluating
    CDIF;</li><li>Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF
    transfer; and</li><li>Those developing importers and exporters.</li></ul>"
