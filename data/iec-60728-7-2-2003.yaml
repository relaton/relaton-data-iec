  content: specifies requirements for The Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) Outside Plant (OSP)
    Media Access Control (MAC) Layer. This standard is part of the series developed
    to support the design and implementation of interoperable management systems for
    evolving HFC cable networks. The HMS Media Access Control (MAC) layer specification
    describes the messaging and protocols implemented at the Data Link Layer (DLL),
    layer 2 in the 7 layer ISO-OSI reference model, that support reliable and efficient
    communications between HMS compliant transponders interfacing to managed OSP network
    elements (NEs) and a centralized head-end element (HE).
