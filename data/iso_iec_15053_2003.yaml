abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15053:2003 specifies Additional Network Feature Call Interception (ANF-CINT),
    which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nANF-CINT
    is an additional network feature which enables calls that cannot be completed
    due to certain conditions to be redirected to a pre-defined intercepted-to user.<br
    />\r\nANF specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method
    described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 15053:2003 contains the stage 1 and stage 2
    specifications of ANF-CINT. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the
    feature as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies
    the functional entities involved in the feature and the information flows between
    them."
