abstract:
- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-43:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-43:2024 CMV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-43:2024 deals with the safety of electric clothes dryers
    including clothes dryers intended for drying footwear or gloves, and towel rails
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V including direct current (DC) powered appliances and battery-operated appliances.
    Appliances not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless can be
    a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen
    in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many
    countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- spin extractors
    (IEC 60335-2-4);<br />\r\n- tumble dryers (IEC 60335-2-11);<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to
    be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of
    a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of
    some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 11.101, 15.101);<br />\r\nc) addition
    of test probe 19 for accessibility of live parts and moving (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3,
    B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) addition of accessible surface temperature limits (11.3,
    11.8).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
