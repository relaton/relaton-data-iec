abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19794-10:2007 specifies a data record interchange format for storing,
    recording and transmitting the information from one or more hand silhouettes within
    a Common Biometric Exchange Formats Framework (CBEFF) data structure. It defines
    the content, format and units of measurement for the exchange of hand silhouette
    data that may be used in the verification or identification process of a subject.
    The information consists of a variety of mandatory and optional items, including
    data capture parameters, standardized hand position and vendor-specific information.
    This information is intended for interchange among organizations that rely on
    automated devices and systems for identification or verification purposes based
    on the information from hand geometry measurements.
