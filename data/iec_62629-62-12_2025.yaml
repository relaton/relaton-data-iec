abstract:
- content: "IEC 62629-62-12:2025 specifies the standard measuring conditions and measurement
    methods for determining image quality for 3D displays that produce virtual images,
    such as 3D headsâ€‘up displays in which the 3D visual information is superimposed
    with the outside world. Eyewear displays are however beyond the scope of this
    document.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document does not intend to include eyewear
    displays considering the difference between a head-up display and an eyewear display
    in the aspect of eye box size and field of view. The eye-tracking function is
    disabled in the image quality measurement of this document."
