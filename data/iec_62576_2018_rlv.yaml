    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62576:2018
    describes the methods for testing electrical characteristics of electric double-layer
    capacitor cells (hereinafter referred to as capacitor) to be used for peak power
    assistance in hybrid electric vehicles. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) information on applicability of this document
