abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14651:2016 defines the following.<br />\r\n- A reference comparison
    method. This method is applicable to two character strings to determine their
    collating order in a sorted list. The method can be applied to strings containing
    characters from the full repertoire of ISO/IEC 10646. This method is also applicable
    to subsets of that repertoire, such as those of the different ISO/IEC 8-bit standard
    character sets, or any other character set, standardized or not, to produce ordering
    results valid (after tailoring) for a given set of languages for each script.
    This method uses collation tables derived either from the Common Template Table
    defined in this International Standard or from one of its tailorings. This method
    provides a reference format. The format is described using the Backus-Naur Form
    (BNF). This format is used to describe the Common Template Table. The format is
    used normatively within this International Standard.<br />\r\n- A Common Template
    Table. A given tailoring of the Common Template Table is used by the reference
    comparison method. The Common Template Table describes an order for all characters
    encoded in the Unicode 8.0 standard, included in ISO/IEC 10646:2014 and its Amendment
    1. It allows for a specification of a fully deterministic ordering. This table
    enables the specification of a string ordering adapted to local ordering rules,
    without requiring an implementer to have knowledge of all the different scripts
    already encoded in the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS).<br />\r\nNOTE 1 This
    Common Template Table is to be modified to suit the needs of a local environment.
    The main worldwide benefit is that, for other scripts, often no modification is
    required and the order will remain as consistent as possible and predictable from
    an international point of view.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The character repertoire used
    in this International Standard is equivalent to that of the Unicode Standard version
    6.0.<br />\r\n- A reference name. The reference name refers to this particular
    version of the Common Template Table, for use as a reference when tailoring. In
    particular, this name implies that the table is linked to a particular stage of
    development of the ISO/IEC 10646 Universal coded character set.<br />\r\n- Requirements
    for a declaration of the differences (delta) between the collation table and the
    Common Template Table.<br />\r\nThis International Standard does not mandate the
    following.<br />\r\n- A specific comparison method; any equivalent method giving
    the same results is acceptable.<br />\r\n- A specific format for describing or
    tailoring tables in a given implementation.<br />\r\n- Specific symbols to be
    used by implementations, except for the name of the Common Template Table.<br
    />\r\n- Any specific user interface for choosing options.<br />\r\n- Any specific
    internal format for intermediate keys used when comparing, nor for the table used.
    The use of numeric keys is not mandated either.<br />\r\n- A context-dependent
    ordering.<br />\r\n- Any particular preparation of character strings prior to
    comparison.<br />\r\nNOTE It is normally necessary to do preparation of character
    strings prior to comparison even if it is not prescribed by this International
    Standard (see Annex C).<br />\r\nAlthough no user interface is required to choose
    options or to specify tailoring of the Common Template Table, conformance requires
    always declaring the applicable delta, a declaration of differences with this
    table. It is recommended that processes present available tailoring options to
    users.<br /><br />\r\nThe electronic version of this International Standard can
    be downloaded from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website."
