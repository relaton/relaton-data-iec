abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29109-6:2011 specifies elements of conformance testing methodology,
    test assertions, and test procedures as applicable to ISO/IEC 19794-6:2005.ISO/IEC
    29109-6:2011 establishestest assertions of the structure of the iris image data
    format as specified in ISO/IEC 19794-6:2005 (Type A Level 1 as defined in ISO/IEC
    29109-1:2009), test asssertions of internal consistency by checking the types
    of values that may be contained within each field (Type A Level 2 as defined in
    ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009), tests of semantic assertions (Type A Level 3 as defined
    in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009). ISO/IEC 29109-6:2010 does not establishtests of conformance
    of CBEFF structures required by ISO/IEC 19794-6:2005, tests of other characteristics
    of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance,
    performance, robustness, security), tests of conformance of systems that do not
    produce ISO/IEC 19794-6:2005 records.
