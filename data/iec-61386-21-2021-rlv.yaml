  content: "IEC 61386-21:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61386-21:2021 specifies
    the requirements for rigid conduit systems. This document is to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 61386-1:2008 and IEC 61386‑1:2008/AMD1:2017. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2002. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Subclause 7.1.103 has been added requiring
    the manufacturer to declare whether the conduit is bendable;<br />\r\n- Annex
    AA has been added to provide guidance on the application of a constantly increasing
    force.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
