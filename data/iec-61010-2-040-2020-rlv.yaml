  content: "IEC 61010-2-040:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61010-2-040:2020
    specifies safety requirements for electrical equipment intended for sterilization,
    washing, and disinfection of medical materials in the medical, veterinary, pharmaceutical
    and laboratory fields, when used under the environmental conditions of 1.4. Examples
    of such equipment include the following:<br />\r\n- sterilizers and disinfectors
    using steam and/or hot water as the sterilant;<br />\r\n- sterilizers and disinfectors
    using toxic gas, toxic aerosol or toxic vapour as the sterilant;<br />\r\n- sterilizers
    and disinfectors using hot air or hot inert gas as the sterilant; and<br />\r\n-
    washer-disinfectors.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- it is established on the basis of the third edition
    (2010) of IEC 61010‑1 and its Amendment 1 (2016);<br />\r\n- added tolerance for
    stability of a.c. voltage test equipment to 6.8.3.1;<br />\r\n- the status of
    a Group Safety Publication has been removed (this does not change the technical
    requirements in the document).</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
