  content: "IEC TR 63282:2024, which is a technical report, collects information and
    report experience for the standardization of voltage levels and related aspects
    (power quality, EMC, measurement, etc.) for LVDC systems (systems with nominal
    voltage up to and including 1 500 V DC).<br />\r\nRationale for the proposed voltage
    values is given. Variation of parameters for the voltage (power quality) for their
    boundaries are defined. Nevertheless, some of the technical items are not exhaustively
    explained in this document and some gaps are identified for future work.<br />\r\nAttention
    is paid to the definition of DC voltage.<br />\r\nSystems in which a unipolar
    voltage is interrupted periodically for certain purposes, e.g. pulse voltage,
    are not considered.<br />\r\nTraction systems are excluded from this document.<br
    />\r\nThis document gives technical inputs to TCs in charge of the standardization
    of different issues and coordinated by SyC LVDC.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Optimized
    terms and definitions in Clause 3: DC system nominal voltage is modified. Oscillation
    is added. Active distribution system, passive distribution system are deleted.<br
    />\r\nb) Modified the definition of voltage bands: In Clause 5, the definition
    of voltage limits in voltage bands is added, from U1 to U6. The definition of
    voltage bands, from B4 to B7, is modified.<br />\r\nc) Distinguished the difference
    between oscillation and power quality phenomenon: In Clause 3, the definition
    of oscillation is added based on IEV 103-05-04. In 6.3, relationship between oscillation
    and power quality is clarified. Annex B gives a LDC oscillation typical example
    which has really happened in a MV&LVDC system in China.<br />\r\nd) Modified the
    recommended voltage for distribution DC network: The factors considered in voltage
    values definition is clarified. And the voltage is divided in two domains, distribution
    domain and installation domain. The voltage recommendation in LVDC is listed corresponding
    to voltage bands.<br />\r\ne) Modified the voltage immunity level assessment:
    It is mentioned in 7.2 that the assessment of voltage immunity levels of mass
    LVDC power electronic devices need to be further discussed, ripple as an example
    is introduced.<br />\r\nf) Added DC power quality measurement methods: In 7.3,
    DC power quality measurement methods is introduced based on AC methodologies.
    And some additional DC power quality indices are recommended to assess the DC
    system. DC electric power and power quality measurement methods are introduced
    in 7.4, defining the electric value integration time and frequency ranges. Typical
    electric power and power quality computation methods are modified in Annex D.<br
    />\r\ng) Added an annex on MVDC system: A use case of a typical MV&LVDC distribution
    system is added in Annex F, to support developments of TS of 8A and 8B on DC microgrids.<br
    />\r\nh) Added an annex on CurrentOS voltage level: The voltage level applied
    in CurrentOS is introduced in Annex L to give more information on the LVDC voltage
    level recommendation."
