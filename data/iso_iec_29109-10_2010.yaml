abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29109-10:2010 specifies elements of conformance testing methodology,
    test assertions, and test procedures as applicable to ISO/IEC 19794-10.ISO/IEC
    29109-10:2010 establishestest assertions of the structure of the hand geometry
    silhouette data format as specified in ISO/IEC 19794-10:2007 (Type A Level 1 as
    defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009),test assertions of internal consistency by checking
    the types of values that may be contained within each field (Type A Level 2 as
    defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009),informative guidance for testing the consistency
    of selected encoded data fields with the input biometric data (Type B Level 3
    as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009).ISO/IEC 29109-10:2010 does not establishtest
    of conformance of CBEFF structures required by ISO/IEC 19794-10:2007,test of consistency
    with input biometric data record (Level 3 as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009),test
    of other characteristics of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric
    products (e.g. acceptance, performance, robustness, security),test of conformance
    of systems that do not produce ISO/IEC 19794-10:2007 records.
