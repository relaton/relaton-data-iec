    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->provides method(s) for
    identifying, in Open-edi modelling technologies and development of scenarios,
    the additional requirements in business operational view (BOV) specifications
    for identifying the additional external constraints to be applied to recorded
    information in business transactions relating to personal information of an individual,
    as required by legal and regulatory requirements of applicable jurisdictional
    domains;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->integrates
    existing normative elements in support of privacy and data protection requirements
    as are already identified in ISO/IEC 14662 and ISO/IEC 15944-1, ISO/IEC 15944-2,
    ISO/IEC 15944-4, ISO/IEC 15944-5, ISO/IEC 15944-8, ISO/IEC 15944-9 and ISO/IEC
    15944-10;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->provides
    overarching, operational ‘best practice’ statements for associated (and not necessarily
    automated) processes, procedures, practices and governance requirements that act
    in support of implementing and enforcing technical mechanisms which support the
    privacy/data protection requirements necessary for implementation in Open-edi
    transaction environments;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1
    lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->focuses on the life cycle management
    of personal information, i.e. the contents of SPIs (and their SRIs) related to
    the business transaction interchanged via EDI as Information Bundles (IBs) and
    their associated Semantic Components (SCs) among the parties to a business transaction.</p><p
    class="Note">NOTE Privacy protection requirements (PPR) on information life cycle
    management (ILCM) and EDI of personal information as stated in this document primarily
    via enumerated rules which serve as a minimum set of ILCM policy and operational
    requirements for all recorded information pertaining to a business transaction
    in particular, as well as ILCM implementation in any organization in general.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document does not specify the technical mechanisms, i.e.
    functional support services (FSV) which are required to support BOV-identified
    requirements. Detailed exclusions to the scope of this document are provided in
    Annex H.</p>'
