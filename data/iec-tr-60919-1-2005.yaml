  content: provides general guidance on the steady-state performance requirements
    of HVDC systems. It concerns the steady-state performance of two-terminal HVDC
    systems utilizing 12-pulse converter units comprised of three-phase bridge (double-
    way) connections (see Figure 1), but it does not cover multi-terminal HVDC transmission
    systems. Both terminals are assumed to use thyristor valves as the main semiconductor
    valves and to have power flow capability in both directions. Diode valves are
    not considered in this report.
