abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-1-114:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61196-1-114:2025
    specifies a test method to determine the inductance characteristics of coaxial
    communication cables. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the term \"inductance\" has been revised;<br />\r\nb)
    the necessary abbreviated term is added;<br />\r\nc) the length and layout of
    the test sample have been revised;<br />\r\nd) the measuring procedure has been
    revised;<br />\r\ne) the additional information for the bending effect on coaxial
    cable inductance test is provided in Annex A."
