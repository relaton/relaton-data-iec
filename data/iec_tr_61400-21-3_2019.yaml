abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61400-21-3:2019 provides guidance on principles which can be used
    as the basis for determining the application, structure and recommendations for
    the WT harmonic model. For the purpose of this Technical Report, a harmonic model
    means a model that represents harmonic emissions of different WT types interacting
    with the connected network.<br />\r\nThis document is focused on providing technical
    guidance concerning the WT harmonic model. It describes the harmonic model in
    detail, covering such aspects as application, structure, as well as validation.
    By introducing a common understanding of the WT representation from a harmonic
    performance perspective, this document aims to bring the overall concept of the
    harmonic model closer to the industry (e.g. suppliers, developers, system operators,
    academia, etc.).<br />\r\nA standardized approach of WT harmonic model representation
    is presented in this document. The harmonic model will find a broad application
    in many areas of electrical engineering related to design, analysis, and optimisation
    of electrical infrastructure of onshore as well as offshore WPPs."
