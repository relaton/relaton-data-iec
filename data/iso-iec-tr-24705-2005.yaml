    <p>ISO/IEC TR 24705:2005 deals with the colour reproduction properties of office devices, e. g. printers, scanners and monitors, which may depend on the device system, which includes e. g. the device properties and settings, the device driver, the file format, the computer operating system and the application software.</p>
    <p>It presents a method to allow testing of the reproduction changes if one or several of the parameters are varied, such as the device properties or settings, the device driver, the file format, the computer operating system, the colour space, and the application software. This allows manufacturers and users to get a feeling or data about the influence of the different parameters on the reproduction.</p>
