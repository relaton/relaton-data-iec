abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 20243-1:2018 (O-TTPS) is a set of guidelines, requirements,
    and recommendations that address specific threats to the integrity of hardware
    and software COTS ICT products throughout the product life cycle. This release
    of the Standard addresses threats related to maliciously tainted and counterfeit
    products.</p><p>The provider's product life cycle includes the work it does designing
    and developing products, as well as the supply chain aspects of that life cycle,
    collectively extending through the following phases: design, sourcing, build,
    fulfillment, distribution, sustainment, and disposal. While this Standard cannot
    fully address threats that originate wholly outside any span of control of the
    provider? for example, a counterfeiter producing a fake printed circuit board
    assembly that has no original linkage to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)?
    the practices detailed in the Standard will provide some level of mitigation.
    An example of such a practice would be the use of security labeling techniques
    in legitimate products.</p>"
