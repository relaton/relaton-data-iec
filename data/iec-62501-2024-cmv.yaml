  content: "IEC 62501:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62501:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62501:2009+AMD1:2014+AMD2:2017
    CSV edition 1.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 22F experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62501:2024 applies to self-commutated converter
    valves, for use in a three-phase bridge voltage sourced converter (VSC) for high
    voltage DC power transmission or as part of a back-to-back link, and to dynamic
    braking valves. It is restricted to electrical type and production tests. This
    document can be used as a guide for testing of high-voltage VSC valves used in
    energy storage systems (ESS). The tests specified in this document are based on
    air insulated valves. The test requirements and acceptance criteria can be used
    for guidance to specify the electrical type and production tests of other types
    of valves. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Conditions for use of evidence in
    lieu are inserted as a new Table 1;<br />\r\nb) Test parameters for valve support
    DC voltage test, 7.3.2, and MVU DC voltage test, 8.4.1, updated;<br />\r\nc) AC-DC
    voltage test between valve terminals, Clause 9, is restructured and alternative
    tests, by individual AC and DC voltage tests, added in 9.4.2;<br />\r\nd) Partial
    discharge test in routine test program is removed;<br />\r\ne) More information
    on valve component fault tolerance, Annex B, is added;<br />\r\nf) Valve losses
    determination is added as Annex C."
