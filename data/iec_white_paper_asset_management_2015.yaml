abstract:
- content: "Worldwide, the electricity industry is facing a number of very significant
    challenges, and the ﬁrst of these, listed by many electricity network business
    CEOs, is asset management.<br /><br />\r\nWhile power networks in developed nations
    struggle with an equipment base nearing the end of its lifetime, those in developing
    countries wrestle with trying to identify best-practice examples to model their
    operations on. This is taking place against a background of changing regulatory
    environments, climate change, evolving consumer behaviour and new market dynamics.<br
    /><br />\r\nThe current lack of International Standards or guidelines on asset
    management for electrical networks will have a significant impact on the reliability
    and future viability of the electricity sector.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper
    explores this issue in depth. It examines asset management in the electricity
    power network sector and identiﬁes areas of asset management practice that could
    beneﬁt from International Standards.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper was prepared
    by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) project team on strategic asset management
    of power networks with support from N.OGEE Consultants after extensive industry
    consultation. Three international workshops, held around the world, were attended
    by electricity network businesses, equipment manufacturers, research institutions
    and other standards organizations.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available
    for free download."
