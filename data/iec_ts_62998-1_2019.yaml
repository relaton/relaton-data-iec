abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62998-1:2019 gives requirements for the development and integration
    of safety related sensors (SRS) and safety related sensor systems (SRSS) used
    for protection of persons with special attention to systematic capabilities.<br
    />\r\nThis generic standard only applies if<br />\r\n– protection of persons is
    to be performed by using sensors, and<br />\r\n– standards for functional safety
    of electrical control systems address sensor(s) as subsystem or subsystem element,
    and<br />\r\n– product specific sensor standards (e.g. IEC 61496 (all parts),
    IEC 60947-5-2) do not contain all necessary provisions, or product specific sensor
    standards are not developed.<br />\r\nThe approach of examination of systematic
    capabilities by using different safety related sensor standards is described in
    Annex A.<br />\r\nThe requirements and methods within this document are limited
    to the purpose of protection of persons<br />\r\n– by detection of potentially
    hazardous objects,<br />\r\n– by detection of a body, parts of a body and objects
    associated to parts of a body entering a hazardous area, or<br />\r\n– by classification
    respective discrimination of these against other objects.<br />\r\nSpecial attention
    is given to the sensing function and dependability of the detection capability.
    Environmental influences and tests for indoor and outdoor use are defined which
    influence the sensing function and dependability of the detection capability.<br
    />\r\nIEC TS 62998-1:2019 can be relevant to applications other than those for
    the protection of persons in industries, for example, for the protection of persons
    in public like agriculture or metro stations.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62998-1:2019 does
    not consider and address proven in use (e.g. processes or elements) as done in
    IEC 61508-2."
