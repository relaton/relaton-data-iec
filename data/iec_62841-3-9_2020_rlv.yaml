abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-3-9:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62841-3-9:2020
    applies to transportable mitre saws intended to be used with a toothed saw blade
    for cutting wood and analogous materials, plastics and nonferrous metals except
    magnesium with a saw blade diameter not exceeding 410 mm, which hereinafter might
    simply be referred to as saw or tool. This International Standard does not apply
    to mitre saws intended to cut other metals, such as magnesium, steel and iron.
    This document does not apply to mitre saws with an automatic feeding device. Transportable
    saws intended to cut ferrous metals will be covered by a future part of IEC 62841-3.
    This document does not apply to saws designed for use with abrasive wheels. Transportable
    tools designed for use with abrasive wheels are covered by IEC 62841-3-10. This
    document does not apply to tools combining the function of a mitre saw with the
    function of a table saw. Transportable tools combining the function of a mitre
    saw with the function of a table saw are covered by by a future part of IEC 62841-3.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Clause 1: Scope: increase of the maximum saw blade diameter to 410 mm;<br />\r\n-
    Corrigendum 1 and Corrigendum 2 of the first edition have been incorporated in
    this second edition.<br />\r\nThis Part 3-9 is to be used in conjunction with
    the IEC 62841-1:2014.<br />\r\nKey words: Hand-Held Tools, Transportable Mitre
    Saw"
