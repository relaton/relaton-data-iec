abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the Spatial Reference Model (SRM) defining
    relevant aspects of spatial positioning and related information processing. The
    SRM allows precise and unambiguous specification of geometric properties such
    as position, direction, orientation, and distance. The SRM addresses the needs
    of a broad community of users, who have a range of accuracy and performance requirements
    in computationally intensive applications.</p><p>Aspects of this document apply
    to, but are not limited to:</p><p>a) mapping, charting, geodesy, and imagery;</p><p>b)
    topography;</p><p>c) location-based services;</p><p>d) oceanography;</p><p>e)
    meteorology and climatology;</p><p>f) interplanetary and planetary sciences;</p><p>g)
    embedded systems; and</p><p>h) modelling and simulation.</p><p>The SRM specifies
    an application program interface (API) that supports the representations, conversion,
    and transformation of position and orientation information in a variety of forms.
    To ensure that spatial operations are performed consistently, the application
    program interface specifies conversion operations between alternative representations
    of geometric properties.</p><p>This document is not intended to replace the standards
    and specifications developed by ISO/TC 211, ISO/TC 184, the International Astronomical
    Union (IAU), and the International Association of Geodesy (IAG). It is applicable
    to applications whose spatial information requirements overlap two or more of
    the application areas that are the scope of the work of ISO/TC 211, ISO/TC 184,
    the IAU, and the IAG.</p>"
