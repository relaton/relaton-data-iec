  content: "IEC 60335-2-52:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-52:2021
    deals with the safety of electric oral hygiene appliances for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V, including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of
    appliances that this standard is applicable to are<br />\r\n- oral irrigators;<br
    />\r\n- toothbrushes.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities,
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition
    cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2002, Amendment 1: 2008 and
    Amendment 2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 11.7, 22.101);<br
    />\r\nc) clarification of requirements for battery-operated appliances (Clause
    1, 11.7, B.11.1);<br />\r\nd) application of test probe 19 has been introduced
    (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\ne) the stability test has been updated to cover hand-held
    parts of battery-operated appliances when placed on their charging stand (20.1);<br
    />\r\nf) a drop test is introduced for hand-held parts of an appliance (21.101);<br
    />\r\ng) additional strength tests for detachable power supply parts are introduced
    (21.102);<br />\r\nh) Table B.2 and Table B.3 updated to reflect smaller cell
    capacities for battery-operated appliances covered by this Part 2 standard.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
