abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15505:2003 specifies supplementary service Message Waiting
    Indication (SS-MWI), which is related, but not limited, to various basic services
    supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are
    specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>This supplementary service MWI enables a Served
    User to be sent a Message Waiting Indication and also enables this Message Waiting
    Indication to be cancelled.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three
    stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 15505:2003 contains
    the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-MWI. The stage 1 specification (clause
    6) specifies the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2
    specification (clause 7) specifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary
    service and the information flows between them.</p>"
