abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14762:2009(E) specifies the general functional safety requirements
    for HBES following the principles of the basic standard for functional safety
    IEC 61508. This International Standard sets the requirements for functional safety
    for Home and Building Electronic Systems (HBES) products and systems, a multi-application
    bus system where the functions are decentralised, distributed and linked through
    a common communication process. The requirements may also apply to the distributed
    functions of any equipment connected in a home or building control system if no
    specific functional safety standard exists for this equipment or system. This
    International Standard only addresses HBES products. HBES and HES products in
    this International Standard are for non-safety related applications.
