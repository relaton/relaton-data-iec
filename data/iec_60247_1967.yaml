abstract:
- content: The scope has been calculated to cover the whole subject of the measurement
    of dielectric properties of insulating liquids. Applies to hydrocarbons and askarels
    as well as to other liquids for which alternative cleaning procedures may be required.
    The measurement methods are primarily intended for making reference tests on unused
    liquids, but they may also be applied to liquids in service.
