- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard defines
    how user oriented performance of computer-based software systems (CBSS)</p><p>may
    be measured and rated. A CBSS is a data processing system as it is seen by its
    users, e.g. by users at various</p><p>terminals, or as it is seen by operational
    users and business users at the data processing center.</p><p>A CBSS includes
    hardware and all its software (system software and application software) which
    is needed to</p><p>realize the data processing functions required by the users
    or what may influence to the CBSS's time behaviour.</p><p>This International Standard
    is applicable for tests of all time constrained systems or system parts. Also
    a network</p><p>may be part of a system or may be the main subject of a test.
    The method defined in this International Standard is</p><p>not limited to special
    cases like classic batch or terminal-host systems, e.g. also included are client
    server systems</p><p>or, with a broader comprehension of the definition of?task',
    real time systems. But the practicability of tests may be</p><p>limited by the
    expenditure required to test large environments.</p><p>This International Standard
    specifies the key figures of user oriented performance terms and specifies a method
    of</p><p>measuring and rating these performance values. The specified performance
    values are those which describe the</p><p>execution speed of user orders (tasks),
    namely the triple of:</p><p>- execution time,</p><p>- throughput,</p><p>- timeliness.</p><p>The
    user orders, subsequently called tasks, may be of simple or complex internal structure.
    A task may be a job,</p><p>transaction, process or a more complex structure, but
    with a defined start and end depending on the needs of the</p><p>evaluator. When
    evaluating the performance it is possible to use this International Standard for
    measuring the time</p><p>behaviour with reference to business transaction completion
    times in addition to other individual response times.</p><p>The rating is done
    with respect to users requirements or by comparing two or more measured systems
    (types or</p><p>versions).</p><p>Intentionally no proposals for measuring internal
    values, such as:</p><p>- utilisation values,</p><p>- mean instruction rates,</p><p>-
    path lengths,</p><p>- cache hit rates,</p><p>- queuing times,</p><p>- service
    times,</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>are given, because the definition of internal
    values depends on the architecture of the hardware and the software of</p><p>the
    system under test. Contrary to this the user oriented performance values which
    are defined in this International</p><p>Standard are independent of architecture.
    The definition of internal performance values can be done independently</p><p>from
    the definition of user oriented performance values. They may be used and can be
    measured in addition to the</p><p>user oriented performance values. Also the definition
    of terms for the efficiency with which the user oriented values</p><p>are produced
    can be done freely. In addition this International Standard gives guidance on
    how to establish at a</p><p>data processing system a stable and reproducible state
    of operation. This reproducible state may be used to</p><p>measure other performance
    values such as the above mentioned internal values.</p><p>This International Standard
    focuses on:</p><p>- application software;</p><p>- system software;</p><p>- turn-key
    systems (i.e. systems consisting of an application software, the system software
    and the</p><p>hardware for which it was designed);</p><p>- general data processing
    systems.</p><p>This International Standard specifies the requirements for an emulation
    (by a technical system - the so-called</p><p>remote terminal emulator (RTE) -
    of user interactions with a data processing system. It is the guideline for precisely</p><p>measuring
    and rating the user oriented performance values. It provides the guideline for
    estimating these values</p><p>with the required accuracy and repeatability of
    CBSSs with deterministic as well as random behaviour of users. It is</p><p>also
    a guidance for implementing a RTE or proving whether it works according to this
    International Standard.</p><p>This International Standard provides the guideline
    to measure and rate the performance of CBSS with random user</p><p>behaviour when
    the accuracy and repeatability is required. It specifies in detail how to prepare
    and carry out the</p><p>measurement procedure. Along with a description of the
    analysis of the measured values, the formulas for</p><p>computing the performance
    value and the rating value, are provided.</p><p>This International Standard also
    gives guidance on:</p><p>- how to design a user oriented benchmark test using
    a:</p><p>* transaction oriented workload,</p><p>* batch oriented workload,</p><p>*
    or transaction and batch mixed workload.</p><p>It specifies:</p><p>- how to describe
    such a workload,</p><p>- how to perform the measurement procedure,</p><p>- how
    to rate the measured results.</p><p>This International Standard is of interest
    to:</p><p>- evaluators,</p><p>- developers,</p><p>- buyers (including users of
    a data processing system),</p><p>- system integrators</p><p>of CBSSs.</p><p>NOTE
    1 The field of application of this International Standard may be extended to include
    the following aspects.</p><p>Workloads fulfilling the specifications of this standard
    and having a sufficiently general structure may be used as standard</p><p>workloads.
    They may be used to measure and rate performance of data processing systems used
    in specific fields. E.g. a</p><p>standard workload for word-processing may be
    used to compare the time efficiency of different software products or</p><p>different
    versions of the same product running on the same hardware system. Such a standard
    workload may also be</p><p>used if always applying the same application software
    version and the same hardware to compare the efficiency of the</p><p>system software.
    When applying the same application software and workload to different systems,
    consisting of hardware</p><p>and system software, as normally sold by system vendors,
    the efficiency of the data processing systems may be</p><p>compared with respect
    to the application and workload used.</p>
