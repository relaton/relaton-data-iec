abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines how user oriented performance of
    computer-based software systems (CBSS)</p><p>may be measured and rated. A CBSS
    is a data processing system as it is seen by its users, e.g. by users at various</p><p>terminals,
    or as it is seen by operational users and business users at the data processing
    center.</p><p>A CBSS includes hardware and all its software (system software and
    application software) which is needed to</p><p>realize the data processing functions
    required by the users or what may influence to the CBSS's time behaviour.</p><p>This
    International Standard is applicable for tests of all time constrained systems
    or system parts. Also a network</p><p>may be part of a system or may be the main
    subject of a test. The method defined in this International Standard is</p><p>not
    limited to special cases like classic batch or terminal-host systems, e.g. also
    included are client server systems</p><p>or, with a broader comprehension of the
    definition of?task', real time systems. But the practicability of tests may be</p><p>limited
    by the expenditure required to test large environments.</p><p>This International
    Standard specifies the key figures of user oriented performance terms and specifies
    a method of</p><p>measuring and rating these performance values. The specified
    performance values are those which describe the</p><p>execution speed of user
    orders (tasks), namely the triple of:</p><p>- execution time,</p><p>- throughput,</p><p>-
    timeliness.</p><p>The user orders, subsequently called tasks, may be of simple
    or complex internal structure. A task may be a job,</p><p>transaction, process
    or a more complex structure, but with a defined start and end depending on the
    needs of the</p><p>evaluator. When evaluating the performance it is possible to
    use this International Standard for measuring the time</p><p>behaviour with reference
    to business transaction completion times in addition to other individual response
    times.</p><p>The rating is done with respect to users requirements or by comparing
    two or more measured systems (types or</p><p>versions).</p><p>Intentionally no
    proposals for measuring internal values, such as:</p><p>- utilisation values,</p><p>-
    mean instruction rates,</p><p>- path lengths,</p><p>- cache hit rates,</p><p>-
    queuing times,</p><p>- service times,</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>are given,
    because the definition of internal values depends on the architecture of the hardware
    and the software of</p><p>the system under test. Contrary to this the user oriented
    performance values which are defined in this International</p><p>Standard are
    independent of architecture. The definition of internal performance values can
    be done independently</p><p>from the definition of user oriented performance values.
    They may be used and can be measured in addition to the</p><p>user oriented performance
    values. Also the definition of terms for the efficiency with which the user oriented
    values</p><p>are produced can be done freely. In addition this International Standard
    gives guidance on how to establish at a</p><p>data processing system a stable
    and reproducible state of operation. This reproducible state may be used to</p><p>measure
    other performance values such as the above mentioned internal values.</p><p>This
    International Standard focuses on:</p><p>- application software;</p><p>- system
    software;</p><p>- turn-key systems (i.e. systems consisting of an application
    software, the system software and the</p><p>hardware for which it was designed);</p><p>-
    general data processing systems.</p><p>This International Standard specifies the
    requirements for an emulation (by a technical system - the so-called</p><p>remote
    terminal emulator (RTE) - of user interactions with a data processing system.
    It is the guideline for precisely</p><p>measuring and rating the user oriented
    performance values. It provides the guideline for estimating these values</p><p>with
    the required accuracy and repeatability of CBSSs with deterministic as well as
    random behaviour of users. It is</p><p>also a guidance for implementing a RTE
    or proving whether it works according to this International Standard.</p><p>This
    International Standard provides the guideline to measure and rate the performance
    of CBSS with random user</p><p>behaviour when the accuracy and repeatability is
    required. It specifies in detail how to prepare and carry out the</p><p>measurement
    procedure. Along with a description of the analysis of the measured values, the
    formulas for</p><p>computing the performance value and the rating value, are provided.</p><p>This
    International Standard also gives guidance on:</p><p>- how to design a user oriented
    benchmark test using a:</p><p>* transaction oriented workload,</p><p>* batch oriented
    workload,</p><p>* or transaction and batch mixed workload.</p><p>It specifies:</p><p>-
    how to describe such a workload,</p><p>- how to perform the measurement procedure,</p><p>-
    how to rate the measured results.</p><p>This International Standard is of interest
    to:</p><p>- evaluators,</p><p>- developers,</p><p>- buyers (including users of
    a data processing system),</p><p>- system integrators</p><p>of CBSSs.</p><p>NOTE
    1 The field of application of this International Standard may be extended to include
    the following aspects.</p><p>Workloads fulfilling the specifications of this standard
    and having a sufficiently general structure may be used as standard</p><p>workloads.
    They may be used to measure and rate performance of data processing systems used
    in specific fields. E.g. a</p><p>standard workload for word-processing may be
    used to compare the time efficiency of different software products or</p><p>different
    versions of the same product running on the same hardware system. Such a standard
    workload may also be</p><p>used if always applying the same application software
    version and the same hardware to compare the efficiency of the</p><p>system software.
    When applying the same application software and workload to different systems,
    consisting of hardware</p><p>and system software, as normally sold by system vendors,
    the efficiency of the data processing systems may be</p><p>compared with respect
    to the application and workload used.</p>"
