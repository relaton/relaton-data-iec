  content: "IEC 61937-2:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61937-2:2021
    specifies the digital audio interface to convey non-linear PCM encoded audio bitstreams
    applying IEC 60958-1 and IEC 60958-3. This document specifies burst-info, which
    defines content information about the data contained in the burst-payload. IEC
    61937-2:2021 cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2007, Amendment
    1:2011 and Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) new audio data-types of MPEG-D USAC, ACX, ACX HBR2,
    ACX HBR4 and ACX HBR8 have been added;<br />\r\nb) extended data-type field in
    Pe has been activated."
