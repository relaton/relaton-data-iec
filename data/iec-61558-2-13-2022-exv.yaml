    to IEC 61558-1:2017.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-13:2022 deals with the safety
    of auto-transformers for general applications and power supply units incorporating
    auto-transformers for general applications. Transformers incorporating electronic
    circuits are also covered by this document. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- adjustment of structure and references in
    accordance with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\n- description of constructions moved
    to IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\n- new symbol for power supply unit with linearly
    regulated output voltage.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication
    in accordance with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/65358\">IEC Guide
    104</a>.\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\"> </div>"
