  content: IEC 60404-1-1:2004+AMD1:2024 CSV establishes a classification of surface
    insulations for electrical steel sheet, strip and laminations according to their
    general composition, relative insulating ability and function. These surface insulations
    are either oxide layers or applied coatings. The purpose of this classification
    is to create a nomenclature for the various types of surface insulations and to
    assist users of surface insulations by providing general information about the
    chemical nature and use of the surface insulations. It is not the intent of this
    classification to specify insulation requirements in terms of specific values
    of surface insulation resistance. Such requirements are agreed between the purchaser
    and the steel producer, where applicable. The classification is used in conjunction
    with the various specifications for cold rolled electrical steels (see the standards
    in the IEC 60404-8 series in Clause 2).
