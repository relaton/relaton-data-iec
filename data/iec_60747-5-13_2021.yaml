abstract:
- content: "IEC 60747-5-13:2021 provides the accelerated test method to assess effects
    of the tarnishing of silver and silver alloys used for LED packages due to hydrogen
    sulphide. Particularly, this test method is intended to give information on silver
    and silver alloy tarnishing effects to the luminous/radiant flux maintenance of
    LED packages. Additionally, this test method can give information on electric
    performances of LED packages due to corrosion of silver and silver alloys.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this test is to determine the influence of atmospheres containing
    hydrogen sulphide on parts of LED packages made of: silver or silver alloy; silver
    or silver alloy protected with another layer; other metals covered with silver
    or silver alloy.<br />\r\nTesting other degradations that are susceptible to affect
    luminous/radiant flux maintenance and/or electric performance (e.g. degradation
    of copper or silicone parts) is not the object of this test. This test might not
    be suitable as a general corrosion test, i.e. it might not predict the behaviour
    of flux and/or electric characteristics and connections in industrial atmospheres.
    This document is applicable to LED packages for lighting applications only if
    referenced by an IEC SC 34A document."
