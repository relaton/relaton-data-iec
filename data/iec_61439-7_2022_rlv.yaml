abstract:
- content: "IEC 61439-7:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61439-7:2022
    defines the specific requirements for assemblies for the following applications:
    marinas, camping sites, market squares and electric vehicle charging stations
    as follows:<br />\r\n- assemblies for which the rated voltage does not exceed
    1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for use in connection
    with the generation, transmission, distribution and conversion of electric energy,
    and for the control of electric energy consuming equipment;<br />\r\n- assemblies
    operated by ordinary persons (e.g. to plug and unplug of electrical equipment);<br
    />\r\n- assemblies intended to be installed and used in market squares, marinas,
    camping sites and other similar sites accessible to the public including temporary
    installations;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for charging stations for electric
    vehicles (AEVCS) for Mode 3 and Mode 4. They are designed to integrate the functionality
    and additional requirements for electric vehicle conductive charging systems according
    to IEC 61851-1:2017.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2018. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following changes with respect to the previous technical specification:<br
    />\r\n- a general editorial review and a technical revision."
