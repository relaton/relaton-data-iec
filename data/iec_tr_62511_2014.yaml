abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62511:2014(E) provides guidelines in planning and design of the
    interconnected power system (IPS) and consequently achieve the delivery of reliable
    supply service. The guidelines for the design of interconnected power systems
    within this document will enhance system reliability, mitigate many of the adverse
    impacts associated with the loss of a major portion of the system or unintentional
    separation of a major portion of the system, and will not be consequential because
    of normal design contingencies. In the context of this Technical Report, interconnected
    power system means an entity's (control area or a system operator) high-voltage
    transmission system that can adversely impact other connected systems due to faults
    and disturbances within its area. In the case of large areas, the system operator
    may define a subset of its area to keep the adverse impact contained within a
    smaller portion of its system. This Technical Report specifies the recommended
    techniques for securing an IPS to ensure a high level of reliability. Generally,
    interconnected power systems are synchronously connected or asynchronously connected
    through DC interconnections. This document aims to ensure that the interconnections
    are designed and operated consistently on both ends. The recommendations include
    design and operation requirements to withstand the primary contingencies specified
    in this document.
