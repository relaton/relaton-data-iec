  content: "IEC 61156-5:2020 describes the cables intended primarily for horizontal
    floor wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801. It covers cable designs comprising individually
    screened, common screened and unscreened pairs or quads. The transmission characteristics
    and the frequency range of the cables are specified at 20 °C. The cables covered
    by this document are intended to operate with voltages and currents normally encountered
    in communication systems Those cables are intended to be used to support the delivery
    of low voltage remote powering applications such as IEEE 802.3af (Power over Ethernet)
    or further developments for example according to IEEE 802.3at or IEEE 802.3bt.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009 and
    Amendment 1:2012. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition<br />\r\n- additional balance levels with
    respect to MICE implementation by certain cabling specifications;<br />\r\n- reference
    to current standards and technical reports with respect to measurement techniques
    and remote powering."
