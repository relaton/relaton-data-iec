  content: "IEC 60601-2-37:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-37:2024
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of ULTRASONIC DIAGNOSTIC
    EQUIPMENT as defined in 201.3.217, hereinafter referred to as ME EQUIPMENT. If
    a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT
    only, or to ME SYSTEMS only, the title and content of that clause or subclause
    will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to
    ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS, as relevant. HAZARDS inherent in the intended
    physiological function of ME EQUIPMENT or ME SYSTEMS within the scope of this
    document are not covered by specific requirements in this document except in 201.7.2.13.
    This document does not cover ultrasonic therapeutic equipment. Equipment used
    for the imaging or diagnosis of body structures by ultrasound in conjunction with
    other medical procedures is covered. IEC 60601-2-37:2024 cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2007 and Amendment 1:2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) technical
    and editorial changes resulting from the amended general standard IEC 60601 1:2005,
    IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD2:2020 and its collateral standards
    IEC 60601-1-xx,<br />\r\nb) technical and editorial changes as a result of maintenance
    to normative references;<br />\r\nc) technical and editorial changes resulting
    from relevant developments in TC 87 Ultrasonics standards. In particular, Clause
    201.11 about protection against excessive temperatures and other hazards has been
    fully revised."
