  content: "IEC TR 63434:2023 is intended to provide awareness about partial discharge
    phenomena. This document gives guidance for some conditions when partial discharge
    can occur in low voltage switchgear and controlgear connected to networks of up
    to 1 000 V AC. Internal operational voltages can exceed these values. This document
    gives guidance on the design of conductors and dimensioning of insulation exposed
    to electrical fields.<br />\r\nThis document explains the partial discharge phenomena
    considering electrical field stress, type of insulation material and other construction
    parameters, such as the voltage, frequency, temperature, humidity and the distances
    within the device."
