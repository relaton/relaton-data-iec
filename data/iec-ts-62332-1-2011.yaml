  content: IEC&#x2F;TS 62332-1:2011(E) is applicable to EIS containing solid and liquid
    components where the thermal stress is the dominant ageing factor, without restriction
    to voltage class. This part specifies a dual-temperature test procedure for the
    thermal evaluation and qualification of electrical insulation systems (EIS). The
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition have
    been made - Modifications have been made based on an extensive test series conducted
    using this methodology given in the first edition. This included updating expected
    times and tempertatures to use in order to obtain useful results, as well as making
    the range of equipment covered broader. The method can now cover electrotechnical
    devices using different sealing systems, as well as devices using enamel covered
    wires.
