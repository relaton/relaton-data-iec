- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-82:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-82:2024 CMV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-82:2024 deals with the safety of electric commercial amusement
    machines and personal service machines, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances, including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples
    of appliances that are within the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n– amusement
    machines: billiard tables, bowling machines, dartboards, driving simulators, gaming
    machines, kiddie rides, laser shooting appliances, pinball machines, video games<br
    />\r\n– personal service machines: card re-value machines, currency dispensers,
    luggage lockers, weighing machines, shoe shining appliances.<br />\r\nAs far as
    is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by users and maintenance persons.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn
    to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or
    on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n–
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national authorities
    responsible for health, for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively
    for household use;<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– appliances for washing cars;<br />\r\n– dispensing appliances and vending
    machines (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n– appliances within the scope of IEC 62368-1,
    such as jukeboxes, household video games copying machines, ticket machines and
    automatic teller machines;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used when a trained
    attendant is present, such as virtual reality systems;<br />\r\n– equipment intended
    exclusively for fairgrounds, such as carousels;<br />\r\n– self-balancing personal
    transport devices (IEC 60335-2-114).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2017 and Amendment 1:2020. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 19.2, 19.101, 22.104);<br />\r\nc) introduction of test probe
    18 (22.101);<br />\r\nd) introduction of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\ne)
    addition of surface temperature rise limits (11.3, 11.8, Table 101).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
