  content: This standard is applicable to power sources for arc welding and allied
    processes designed for industrial and professional use and supplied by a voltage
    within the low voltage range (as specified in IEC 38) or driven by mechanical
    means. This standard is not applicable to welding power sources for manual metal
    arc welding with limited duty operation which are designed mainly for use by laymen.
