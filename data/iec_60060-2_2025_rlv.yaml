abstract:
- content: "IEC 60060-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60060-2:2025
    is applicable to complete measuring systems and to their components, used for
    the measurement of high voltages during laboratory and factory tests with direct
    voltage, alternating voltage and lightning and switching impulse voltages and
    combined and composite voltages as specified in IEC 60060-1. For measurements
    during on-site tests, see IEC 60060-3. The limits on uncertainties of measurements
    stated in this document apply to test levels stated in IEC 60071-1. The principles
    of this document apply also to higher levels but the uncertainty can be greater.<br
    />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n• defines the terms used;<br />\r\n• describes methods
    to estimate the uncertainties of high-voltage measurements;<br />\r\n• states
    the requirements that apply to measuring systems;<br />\r\n• describes the methods
    for approving a measuring system and checking its components;<br />\r\n• describes
    the procedures by which the user demonstrates that a measuring system meets the
    requirements of this document, including the limits set for the uncertainty of
    measurement.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) The general layout and text has been updated and
    improved to make the standard easier to use.<br />\r\nb) This document has been
    revised to align it with the fourth edition of IEC 60060-1.<br />\r\nc) The treatment
    of measurement uncertainty estimation has been expanded.<br />\r\nd) This document
    is now applicable to measuring systems used in testing at all standard insulation
    levels specified in IEC 60071-1.<br />\r\ne) The measurement uncertainty requirement
    for the front time of the standard lighting impulse voltage has been changed from
    10 % to 15 %, for testing at all standard insulation levels specified in IEC 60071-1.<br
    />\r\nf) The parameter \"time-to-peak\" of the switching impulse defined in the
    third edition of IEC 60060-1:2010 has been replaced by \"front time\" in the fourth
    edition of IEC 60060-1. Necessary changes have been made in this document to accommodate
    this change in IEC 60060-1.<br />\r\ng) Clause 10, Measurement of combined voltages
    and Clause 11, Measurement of composite voltages have been added.<br />\r\nh)
    Clause B.1 has been significantly revised to align more closely with the provisions
    of Clause 5, including using the same nomenclature."
