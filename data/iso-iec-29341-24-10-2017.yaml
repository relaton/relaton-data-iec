    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-24-10:2017 specifies the characteristics of the UPnP networked service named WANIPConnection, version 2. This service definition is compliant with UPnP Device Architecture 1.0 [1] . It is one component of the Device Control Protocol for the UPnP Internet Gateway Device (see [3]). </p>
    <p>This service enables a UPnP control point to:</p>
    <p>-           configure and control an IP connection between a LAN client on one side of an Internet gateway (see [3]) and a WAN host on the other side;</p>
    <p>-           manage any physical WAN interface?such as DSL or cable?that supports an IP connection.</p>
    <p>This service is a required in a WANConnectionDevice (see [5]) when the device supports an IP connection.</p>
