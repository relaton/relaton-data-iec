abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11889 defines the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a device that enables trust in
    computing platforms in general. ISO/IEC 11889-1:2009 is an overview of the TPM.
    It describes the TPM and how it fits into the trusted platform. ISO/IEC 11889-1:2009
    describes trusted platform concepts such as the trust boundary, transitive trust,
    integrity measurement, and integrity reporting.<br />\r\nThis standard has been
    revised by ISO/IEC 11889-1:2015. However, the 2009 Edition remains available through
    2025 to permit stakeholders to complete technical work tailoring their adoption
    of the 2015 Edition to meet their security and privacy objectives."
