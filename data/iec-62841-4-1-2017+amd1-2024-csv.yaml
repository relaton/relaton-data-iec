  content: "IEC 62841-4-1:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to chain saws for cutting wood
    and designed for use by one person. This standard does not cover chain saws designed
    for use in conjunction with a guide-plate and riving knife or in any other way
    such as with a support or as a stationary or transportable machine. This standard
    does not apply to chain saws for tree service as defined in ISO 11681-2; or pole-mounted
    pruners. Pole-mounted pruners will be covered by a future part of IEC 62841. The
    chain saws covered by this standard are designed only to be operated with the
    right hand on the rear handle and the left hand on the front handle. This Part
    4-1 is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014. The
    attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers
    and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication
    of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance
    with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised
    tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date
    of publication.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-06) has been included
    in this copy."
