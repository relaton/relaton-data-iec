    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62911:2025 defines procedures
    for use during or after manufacturing of complete equipment, sub-assemblies or
    components, complying with IEC 62368-1 and powered by an AC or DC, to detect manufacturing
    failures and unacceptable tolerances in manufacturing and materials.<br />\r\nNOTE
    1: Not all the tests defined in this document are necessarily performed at the
    end product manufacturing location. The optimal location for the can be defined
    by the equipment manufacturer and reviewed under the applicable conformity assessment
    scheme.<br />\r\nNOTE 2: The test procedures in this document are intended to
    identify production and manufacturing errors. These test procedures are not intended
    for product development or verification (see The test procedures in this document
