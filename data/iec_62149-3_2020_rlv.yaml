abstract:
- content: "IEC 62149-3:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62149-3:2020 covers the
    performance specification for electroabsorption (EA) type optical modulators monolithically
    integrated with laser diodes for 40 Gbit/s fibre optic transmission systems. This
    document contains a definition of the product performance requirements together
    with a series of sets of tests and measurements with clearly defined conditions,
    severities and pass/fail criteria. The tests are intended to be run as an initial
    design verification to prove any product's ability to satisfy this document's
    requirements. This document is applicable for on-off keying format. A product
    that has been shown to meet all the requirements of a performance standard can
    be declared as compliant with the performance standard but will then be controlled
    by a quality assurance program. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2014 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    updates of the title, scope, normative references and performance test tables.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of February 2021 have been included in this
    copy.</p>"
