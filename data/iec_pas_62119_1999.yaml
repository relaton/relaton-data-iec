abstract:
- content: Specifies data file formats used to describe printed board and printed
    board assembly products with details sufficient for tooling, manufacturing, assembly,
    inspection and testing requirements. These formats may be used for transmitting
    information between a printed board designer and a manufacturing or assembly facility.
    The files are also useful when the manufacturing cycle includes computer-aided
    processes and numerical control machines.
