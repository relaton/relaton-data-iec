abstract:
- content: "ISO 30192:2016 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 25,0 Gbytes or 50,0 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. User data can be written, read and overwritten many times
    using a reversible method. A conforming disk is identified as a BD Rewritable
    disk.<p>ISO 30192:2016 specifies the following:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\ttwo related but
    different Types of this disk;\r\n\tconditions for conformance;\r\n\tenvironments
    in which the disk is to be operated and stored;\r\n\tmechanical and physical characteristics
    of the disk, which allow mechanical interchange between data processing systems;\r\n\tformat
    of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the Tracks
    and Sectors;\r\n\terror-correcting codes and coding method used;\r\n\tcharacteristics
    of the signals recorded on the disk, which enable data processing systems to read
    data from the disk.<p>This International Standard provides for interchange of
    disks between drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
