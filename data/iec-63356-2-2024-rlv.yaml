  content: "IEC 63356-2:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 63356-2:2024
    specifies design parameters and design values of an LED light source or related
    interface characteristics.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Interface characteristics can cover
    interfaces between the LED light source and the luminaire or the controlgear,
    or the LED light source and additional attachments.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Interfaces
    can be related to for example electrical, mechanical, or optical aspects.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not cover interchangeability between products from different LED
    light source manufacturers.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 Interchangeability is covered by IEC
    63356-1.<br />\r\nLamp caps and lampholders specified in the IEC 60061 series
    are not within the scope of this document. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2022. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) a new Clause 6 for circular LED modules with
    a circular light emitting surface for spot lighting has been added;<br />\r\nb)
    a new Clause 7 for LEDni modules with a rectangular shape and a circular light
    emitting surface has been added."
