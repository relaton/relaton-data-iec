    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20913:2016 describes backgrounds, motivation, and general concept of holistic methodology for data centre key performance indicators (KPIs) to investigate the status of KPIs. It discusses the usefulness of holistic investigation methodology in terms of aggregating a KPI across different contexts, aggregation of two or more KPIs within a single context, aggregation of two or more KPIs across multiple contexts, and aggregation of the multiple KPIs into a single indicator. This document presents a conventional spider web chart-based data centre KPIs status observation method and a control chart method including upper bound and lower bound of the operational status of KPIs. This document presents SWOT analysis results for both methodologies. The methods described in this document are aimed at the self-monitoring of a data centre, not comparison among data centres.</p>

    <p>a)   describes backgrounds, motivation, and general concept of holistic investigation methodology for data centre KPIs,</p>
    <p>b)   analyses the usefulness of holistic investigation methodology for aggregating KPIs,</p>
    <p>c)   describes a spider web chart-based KPIs status observation method and a control chart extending spider web chart to observe the operational status of KPIs,</p>
    <p>d)   describes alternative and/or additional methods of representing dissimilar KPIs to track holistic resource effectiveness of the data centre, and</p>
    <p>e)   presents SWOT analysis results for holistic investigation methods described in this document.</p>
