  content: IEC 62153-4-15:2015(E) specifies the procedures for measuring with triaxial
    cell the transfer impedance, screening attenuation or the coupling attenuation
    of connectors, cable assemblies and components, e.g. accessories for analogue
    and digital transmission systems and equipment for communication networks and
    cabling (in accordance with the scope of IEC technical committee 46). Measurements
    can be achieved by applying the device under test direct to the triaxial cell
    or with the tube in tube method in accordance with IEC 62153-4-7.
