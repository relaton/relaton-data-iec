  content: "IEC 60974-13:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60974-13:2021 is applicable
    to welding current return clamps for arc welding processes, designed to make an
    electrical connection to the workpiece without using tools. This document is not
    applicable to welding current return clamps for underwater welding and plasma
    cutting.<br />\r\nThis document specifies safety and performance requirements
    of welding current return clamps. This document does not specify requirements
    for welding cables. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition,
    published in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThe significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition are the following:<br />\r\n-
    Modified the title from \"Welding clamp\" to \"Welding current return clamp\"
    and updated the term through the document.<br />\r\n- Updated all values of test
    current in Table 1 corrected to 40 °C.<br />\r\n- Updated the reference to EN
    50565-1:2014, Electric cables - Guide to use for cables with a rated voltage not
    exceeding 450/750 V (U0/U) – Part 1: General guidance<br />\r\nThis part of IEC
    60974 is to be used in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/34048\">IEC
    60974-1</a>.</p>"
