  content: "IEC 63044-3:2017+A1:2021 specifies the electrical safety requirements
    for HBES/BACS. In addition, it defines safety requirements for the interface of
    equipment intended to be connected to an HBES/BACS. It does not apply to interfaces
    to other networks.<br />\r\nNOTE An example of other networks is a dedicated ICT
    network covered by IEC 62949.<br />\r\nThis document covers the following requirements
    and compliance criteria:<br />\r\n- protection against hazards from the device;<br
    />\r\n- protection against overvoltages on the network;<br />\r\n- protection
    against touch current;<br />\r\n- protection against hazards caused by different
    types of network;<br />\r\n- protection of the communication wiring against overheating
    caused by excessive current."
