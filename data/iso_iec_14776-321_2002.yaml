abstract:
- content: The SCSI command set described in this document is designed to provide
    efficient peer-to-peer operation of input&#x2F;output logical units by an operating
    system using block transfers. The SCSI command set assumes an underlying command-response
    protocol. This SCSI command set provides multiple operating systems concurrent
    control over one or more input&#x2F;output logical units. However, the multiple
    operating systems are assumed to coordinate their actions properly to prevent
    data corruption. This SCSI standard provides commands that assist with coordination
    between multiple operating systems. However, details of the coordination are beyond
    the scope of the SCSI command set.
