    <p>This document lists all the test conditions to be performed on a PT reader or a PT object in order to ensure that all the requirements specified in ISO/IEC TS 24192-1 are met for the PT device under test.</p>
    <p>This document applies to PT devices only:</p>
    <p>—    PT readers which are contactless fare management system terminals acting as a PCD contactless reader based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts);</p>
    <p>—    PT objects which are contactless fare media acting as a PICC contactless object based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts).</p>
    <p>This document applies solely to the contactless communication layers described in ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts). Application-to-application exchanges executed once contactless communication has been established at RF level fall outside the scope of this document. However, a test application is used to make end-to-end transactions during tests on the RF communication layer.</p>
    <p>This document does not duplicate the contents of ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts) or ISO/IEC 10373‑6. It makes reference to the ISO/IEC 10373‑6 applicable test methods, specifies the test conditions to be used and describes the additional specific test conditions that can be run.</p>
