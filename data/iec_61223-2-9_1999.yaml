abstract:
- content: 'Applies to those components of X-ray equipment which a) generate, influence
    the propagation of, and detect X-radiation, and b) process, present and store
    diagnostic X-ray images in radiological installations with diagnostic X-ray systems
    for indirect radioscopy and indirect radiography which use X-ray image intensifiers
    in conjunction with analogue and/or digital storage systems: - closed-circuit
    television display system - cut films cameras - cine cameras. This standard defines
    - the essential parameters which describe or affect the performance of the above
    components of X-ray equipment, and - methods of checking that variations in measured
    quantities related to those parameters are within acceptable limits, in order
    to maintain adequate standards of imaging whilst reducing unnecessary irradiation
    of the patient.'
