    <p><b>1.1 Context of the scope</b></p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 13522 specifies the coded representation of multimedia/hypermedia information objects (MHEG objects)</p>
    <p>for interchange as final form units within or across services and applications, by any means of interchange</p>
    <p>including local area networks, wide area telecommunication or broadcast networks, storage media, etc.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 defines the MHEG-5 object classes for interchange and use in base-level applications</p>
    <p>intended to be run on limited resource terminals such as set-top-boxes in such contexts as interactive broadband</p>
    <p>services.</p>
    <p>Annex F of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 specifies the features that need to be defined by a specific MHEG-5 application</p>
    <p>domain. The informative annexes of this part of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 give illustrative examples of profiles of</p>
    <p>some common application domains.</p>
    <p><b>1.2 Scope</b></p>
    <p>MHEG-5 engines are system or application components that handle, interpret and present MHEG-5 objects. The</p>
    <p>scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 is to define a test suite that can be used to test an MHEG-5 engine's</p>
    <p>conformance to a specific application domain. It also defines a format for test cases that can be used to extend the</p>
    <p>test suite, either for more detailed testing or for extensions defined by the application domain.</p>
    <p>It is beyond the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 to define tests for engine performance, engine memory usage</p>
    <p>or for MHEG-5 applications that run on these engines.</p>
    <p>This part of the ISO/IEC 13522 specifies test cases for <i>all </i>features of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997. Application domains</p>
    <p>define a <i>subset </i>of MHEG-5 features that must be supported. In order to test conformance to a specific application</p>
    <p>domain, a corresponding <i>subset </i>of the test cases must be defined. This subset of the test suite is then used to test</p>
    <p>the conformance of the engine.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13522 tests conformance of the behaviour of an MHEG engine. It does not validate the</p>
    <p>physical presentation of MHEG-5 objects.</p>
    <p>The test suite comprises a set of test cases and a corresponding set of test objects. The test cases are defined in</p>
    <p>terms of:</p>
    <p>_ test purpose;</p>
    <p>_ objects and procedures which are to be used to test one or more MHEG-5 features;</p>
    <p>_ expected result.</p>
    <p><b>ISO/IEC 13522-7:2001(E)</b></p>
    <p>A set of content data will be provided for the test objects. These content data are intended as a guide for</p>
    <p>generating a test suite and should be converted or replaced by content formats appropriate to the Application</p>
    <p>Domain.</p>
    <p>A test suite for an Application Domain shall be generated by using the PICS template in subclause 9.2.1 PICS</p>
    <p>Template.</p>
