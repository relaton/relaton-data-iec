  content: "IEC TS 62565-5-3:2025 which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine a blank detail specification (BDS) for<br />\r\n‭•
    silicon nanosized materials<br />\r\nused for<br />\r\n‭• negative electrode of
    lithium-ion batteries.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to be used for silicon
    nanosized materials for the negative electrode of lithium-ion batteries which
    have been widely employed in the fields of<br />\r\n- portable devices,<br />\r\n-
    power tools,<br />\r\n- electric vehicles, and<br />\r\n- energy storage system.<br
    />\r\nNumeric values for the key control characteristics are left blank as they
    will be specified between customer and supplier in the detail specification (DS).
    In the DS key control characteristics can be added or removed if agreed between
    customer and supplier."
