abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24731 provides alternative functions for the C library that
    promote safer, more secure programming. ISO/IEC TR 24731-1 provides simple replacement
    functions for the library functions of ISO/IEC 9899:1999 that provide bounds checking.
    Those functions can be used as simple replacements for the original library functions
    in legacy code. ISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010 presents replacements for many of these
    functions that use dynamically allocated memory to ensure that buffer overflow
    does not occur.</p>"
