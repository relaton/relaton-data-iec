abstract:
- content: "IEC 62631-3-2:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62631-3-2:2023 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62631-3-2:2015
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 112 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62631-3-2:2023 describes methods of test for the determination
    of surface resistance and surface resistivity of electrical insulation materials
    by applying DC voltage. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) descriptions of the
    electrode arrangements have been clarified;<br />\r\nb) new descriptions of the
    conductive means have been added;<br />\r\nc) a new informative Annex B summarizing
    the results of the comparative verification study on surface resistivities using
    different electrode arrangements has been added."
