abstract:
- content: "IEC 60331-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60331-1:2018
    specifies the test method for cables which are required to maintain circuit integrity
    when subject to fire and mechanical shock under specified conditions. This document
    is applicable to cables of rated voltage not exceeding 600 V/1 000 V, including
    those of rated voltage below 80 V, metallic data and telecom cables and optical
    fibre cables. It is intended for use when testing cables of greater than 20 mm
    overall diameter. Cables of smaller diameter are intended to be tested using the
    apparatus, procedure and requirements of IEC 60331-2. This document includes details
    for the specific point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample,
    test procedure and test report relevant to electric power and control cables with
    rated voltage up to and including 600 V/1 000 V. Details for the specific point
    of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample, test procedure and test
    report relevant to metallic data and telecom cables and optical fibre cables are
    not given by IEC 60331-1. Although the scope is restricted to cables with rated
    voltage up to and including 0,6/1,0 kV, the procedure can be used, with the agreement
    of the manufacturer and the purchaser, for cables with rated voltage up to and
    including 1,8/3 (3,3) kV, provided that suitable fuses are used. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009. It constitutes a technical
    revision. The significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition
    are as follows:<br />\r\n– extension of the scope to include metallic data and
    telecom cables and optical fibre cables, although details for the specific point
    of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample, test procedure and test
    report relevant to metallic data and telecom cables and optical fibre cables are
    not given by IEC 60331-1;<br />\r\n– improved description of the test environment;<br
    />\r\n– modified steel test ladder with two extra vertical elements to accommodate
    the modified testing of single core cables without concentric metal layer and
    the testing of cables with a bending radius in normal use larger than approximately
    400 mm;<br />\r\n– mandatory use of mass flow meters/controllers as the means
    of controlling accurately the input flow rates of fuel and air to the burner;<br
    />\r\n– improved description of the information to be included in the test report.<br
    />\r\nThis document has the status of a group safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104."
