abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61340-1:2012+A1:2020 describes the fundamental principles of electrostatic
    phenomena including charge generation, retention and dissipation and electrostatic
    discharges. Methods for measuring electrostatic phenomena and related properties
    of materials are described in a general way. Hazards and problems associated with
    electrostatic phenomena and principles of their control are outlined. Useful applications
    of electrostatic effects are summarized. The purpose of this technical report
    is to serve as a reference for the development of electrostatics related standards,
    and to provide guidance for their end-users. The contents of the corrigendum of
    March 2013 and the corrigendum 2 of December 2017 have been included in this copy.<strong>This
    consolidated version consists of the first edition (2012) and its amendment 1
    (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>
