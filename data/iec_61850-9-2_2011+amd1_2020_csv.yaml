abstract:
- content: "IEC 61850-9-2:2011+A1:2020 defines the specific communication service
    mapping for the transmission of sampled values according to the abstract specification
    in IEC 61850-7-2. The mapping is that of the abstract model on a mixed stack using
    direct access to an ISO/IEC 8802-3 link for the transmission of the samples in
    combination with IEC 61850-8-1. Main changes with respect to the first edition
    are:<br />\r\n- addition of an optional link redundancy layer;<br />\r\n- redefinition
    of \"reserved\" fields in link layer;<br />\r\n- evolution of USVCB and MSVCB
    components;<br />\r\n- evolution of encoding for the transmission of the sampled
    value buffer.<br /><strong>This consolidated version consists of the second edition
    (2010) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong>"
