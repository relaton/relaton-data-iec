    <p>This International Standard specifies a method for measuring the throughput of class 1 and class 2 printers, as</p>
    <p>defined in ISO/IEC 11160-1. This International Standard specifies three different test patterns:</p>
    <p>·  a standard business letter;</p>
    <p>·  a spreadsheet;</p>
    <p>·  a graphic pattern.</p>
    <p>In addition, this International Standard defines a method for a performance test and one for an endurance test.</p>
    <p>These tests are intended to measure only the printer throughput for documents in the same class as the test</p>
    <p>patterns and not to evaluate any other printer features such as character shaping, print compressions,</p>
    <p>network/controller performance, colour, etc. The method is relevant to class 1 and class 2 printer types (e.g. dot</p>
    <p>matrix, daisy wheel, ink jet, thermal transfer printers) and to all configurations (e.g. tractor feed, cut sheet feed,</p>
    <p>80-column and over 132-column print width, etc.). It is not the most suitable for comparing performance of other</p>
    <p>classes of printing devices such as high-speed page-oriented printers or color printers.</p>
    <p>This method is intended for use by printer manufacturers and test houses so that a common form of test result</p>
    <p>presentation shall be obtained. It will also enable a user to make a quick and easy comparison of the printing</p>
    <p>throughput of different printers.</p>
