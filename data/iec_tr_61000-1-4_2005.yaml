abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61000, which is an IEC technical report, reviews the sources
    and effects of power frequency conducted harmonic current emissions in the frequency
    range up to 2 kHz on the public electricity supply, and gives an account of the
    reasoning and calculations leading to the existing emission limits for equipment
    in the editions of IEC 61000-3-2, up to and including the second edition (2000)
    and its first amendment (2001), and in the first edition of IEC 61000-3-12 (2004).
    The concepts in this technical report apply to all low voltage AC systems, but
    the numerical values apply specifically to the European 230 V/400 V 50 Hz system.
