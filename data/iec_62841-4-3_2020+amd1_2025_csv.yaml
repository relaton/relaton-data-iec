- content: "IEC 62841-4-3:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV This document applies to the design of
    pedestrian controlled walk-behind<br />\r\n- cylinder lawnmowers;<br />\r\nand<br
    />\r\n- rotary lawnmowers<br />\r\nequipped with<br />\r\n- metallic cutting means;
    and/or<br />\r\n- rigid non-metallic cutting means; and/or<br />\r\n- non-metallic
    cutting means with one or more cutting elements pivotally mounted on a generally
    circular drive unit, where these cutting elements rely on centrifugal force to
    achieve cutting, and have a kinetic energy for each single cutting element of
    greater than 10 J.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to<br />\r\n- robotic
    lawnmowers;<br />\r\n- remote-controlled lawnmowers;<br />\r\n- flail mowers or
    flail-type attachments;<br />\r\n- scissors type lawnmowers;<br />\r\n- grassland
    mowers;<br />\r\n- sickle bar mowers;<br />\r\n- towed/semi-mounted grass-cutting
    machines;<br />\r\n- scrub-clearing machines;<br />\r\n- lawn trimmers and lawn

    powered machines and associated charging systems; and<br />\r\n- garden tractors
