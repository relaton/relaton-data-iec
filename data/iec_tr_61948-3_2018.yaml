abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61948-3:2018(E) describes test methods for Positron Emission Tomographs
    (PET). As part of quality control, this document is defining routine tests to
    be performed by the user of Positron Emission Tomographs to maintain proper operation
    conditions. The results of these routine tests are compared to the reference data
    determined during or after acceptance test. Methods used for acceptance tests
    are described in IEC 61675-1:2013.<br />\r\nIn addition, today a Positron Emission
    Tomograph often includes X-Ray equipment for Computed Tomography (CT). For this
    document, PET/CT hybrid devices are considered to be state of the art, dedicated
    Positron Emission Tomographs not including the X-ray component being special cases
    only.<br />\r\nquality control tests specific to only the CT component of the
    PET/CT are described in IEC 61223-2-6. The CT scanner also is subject to a type
    test according to IEC 60601-1 and applicable collateral and particular standards.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) a clause to check routine performance tests has been added,<br />\r\nb)
    a test to check the accuracy of co-registration of PET and CT images has been
    added,<br />\r\nc) a test to check image quality has been added,<br />\r\nd) the
    test to check pixel size has been removed."
