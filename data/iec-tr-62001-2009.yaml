  content: IEC/TR 62001:2009(E) deals with the specification and design evaluation
    of a.c. side harmonic performance and a.c. side filters for high-voltage direct
    current (HVDC) schemes. It is intended to be primarily for the use of the utilities
    and consultants who are responsible for issuing the technical specifications for
    new HVDC projects and evaluating designs proposed by prospective suppliers. The
    scope of this technical report covers a.c. side filtering for the frequency range
    of interest in terms of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances.
    It excludes filters designed to be effective in the Power Line Carrier (PLC) and
    radio interference spectra. The technical report defines the technical basis for
    a contract between two parties, who in this document will be referred to as the
    "customer" and the "contractor". This technical report cancels and replaces IEC/PAS
    62001 published in 2004. This first edition constitutes a technical revision.
