abstract:
- content: Applies to all equipment and devices implemented according to IEC 61375-1,
    that is covers the procedures to be applied to such equipment and devices when
    the conformance should be proven. The applicability of this standard to a TCN
    implementation allows for individual conformance checking of the implementation
    itself and is a pre-requisite for further interoperability checking between different
    TCN implementations.
