    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-6:2016 specifies directly or by reference, data elements, including composite data elements that may be used in interindustry interchange.</p>
    <p>It identifies the following characteristics of each data element:</p>
    <p>-      identifier;</p>
    <p>-      name;</p>
    <p>-      description and reference;</p>
    <p>-      format and coding (if not available in other ISO standards or parts of ISO/IEC 7816).</p>
    <p>The layout of each data element is described as seen at the interface between the interface device and the card.</p>
    <p>It provides the definition of data elements without consideration of any restrictions on the usage of the data elements.</p>
    <p>It does not cover the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside world. With the exception of login data objects (6.5), only application class tags are eligible in ISO/IEC 7816-6:2016.</p>
    <p>When using an interindustry template, an application is allowed to nest context-specific class tags (see ISO/IEC 7816‑4) under such a template unless it is previously marked as Reserved for Future Use ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 17.</p>
