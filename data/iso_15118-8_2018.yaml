abstract:
- content: "ISO 15118-8:2018 specifies the requirements of the physical and data link
    layer of a wireless High Level Communication (HLC) between Electric Vehicles (EV)
    and the Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). The wireless communication technology
    is used as an alternative to the wired communication technology as defined in
    ISO 15118‑3.<br />\r\nIt covers the overall information exchange between all actors
    involved in the electrical energy exchange. ISO 15118 (all parts) are applicable
    for conductive charging as well as Wireless Power Transfer (WPT).<br />\r\nFor
    conductive charging, only EVSEs compliant with \"IEC 61851‑1 modes 3 and 4\" and
    supporting HLC are covered by this document. For WPT, charging sites according
    to IEC 61980 (all parts) and vehicles according to ISO/PAS 19363 are covered by
    this document."
