abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19784-4:2011 specifies a biometric sensor interface for a Biometric
    Service Provider (BSP, see ISO/IEC 19784-1). The interface supports a BSP wishing
    to provide the BioAPI Service Provider Interface (SPI) functions, whilst removing
    device handling activity from the BSP. ISO/IEC 19784-4:2011 provides an interface
    that can be used by all types of biometric sensor, including  inter alia  image
    streaming sensors (infrared, face, iris, finger, etc.), voice streaming sensors
    and digital tablets providing dynamic signature data.  It is not in the scope
    of ISO/IEC 19784-4:2011 to define security and privacy requirements for capturing
    and transferring of biometric data across the Sensor Function Provider Interface
    (SFPI).
