abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23001-2:2008 specifies the Fragment Request Unit technology. It
    comprises a syntax and semantics for expressing a request for fragments of XML.
    It also specifies how such requests can be used in XML based systems such as ISO/IEC
    15938-1 and ISO/IEC 23001-1. The technology can be used in resource constrained
    environments so that only the fragments of XML of interest at a given time need
    be transmitted to a requesting peer from a responding peer. It can also be used
    for node-by-node navigation of a remote XML document.
