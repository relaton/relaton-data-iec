  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19775 (X3D) defines a system that integrates 3D graphics and
    multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space that contains
    graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of
    mechanisms. ISO/IEC 19776-3:2007 defines a mapping of the abstract objects in
    X3D to a specific X3D encoding written out in a compact binary form.</p>"
