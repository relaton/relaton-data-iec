abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    ISO/IEC 19763 multipart International Standard specifies a metamodel framework
    for interoperability. ISO/IEC 19763-12:2015 specifies a metamodel for registering
    information models. This metamodel was developed taking into account two distinct
    types of information models such as - those that are used to document the information
    requirements of a particular area of interest, and - those that represent the
    structure of a database which are often expressed using a Database Definition
    Language (DDL)."
