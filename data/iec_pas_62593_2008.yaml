abstract:
- content: "IEC/PAS 62593:2008(E) gives a measurement method of half-wavelength voltage
    applicable to Mach-Zehnder optical modulators in wireless communication and broadcasting
    systems. In addition, this method is also effective for the estimation of the
    intermodulation distortion of Mach-Zehnder optical modulators.<br />\r\n- Frequency
    range: 10 MHz to 30 GHz.<br />\r\n- Wavelength band: 0,8 µm, 1,0 µm, 1,3 µm and
    1,5 µm.<br />\r\n- Electro-optic material based Mach-Zehnder optical modulators
    and their modules."
