abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62862-2-1:2021 defines the requirements and the test methods for
    the characterization of thermal energy storage (TES) systems. This document contains
    the information necessary for determining the performance and functional characteristics
    of active direct and indirect thermal energy storage systems based on sensible
    heat in solar thermal power plants using parabolic-trough collector, Fresnel collector
    or tower central receiver technology with liquid storage media.<br />\r\nThis
    document includes characterization procedures for testing energy storage system
    charge and discharge, as well as reporting the results. Test performance requirements
    are given and the instrumentation necessary for them, as well as data acquisition
    and processing methods and methods for calculating the results and their uncertainties."
