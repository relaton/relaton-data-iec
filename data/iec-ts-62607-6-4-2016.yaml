  content: IEC TS 62607-6-4:2016(E) establishes a method for determining the surface
    conductance of two-dimensional (2D) single-layer or multi-layer atomically thin
    nano-carbon graphene structures. These are synthesized by chemical vapour deposition
    (CVD), epitaxial growth on silicon carbide (SiC), obtained from reduced graphene
    oxide (rGO) or mechanically exfoliated from graphite. The measurements are made
    in an air filled standard R100 rectangular waveguide configuration, at one of
    the resonant frequency modes, typically at 7 GHz. Surface conductance measurement
    by resonant cavity involves monitoring the resonant frequency shift and change
    in the quality factor before and after insertion of the specimen into the cavity
    in a quantitative correlation with the specimen surface area. This measurement
    does not explicitly depend on the thickness of the nano-carbon layer. The thickness
    of the specimen does not need to be known, but it is assumed that the lateral
    dimension is uniform over the specimen area.
