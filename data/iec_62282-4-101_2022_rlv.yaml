abstract:
- content: "IEC 62282-4-101:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62282-4-101:2022
    deals with safety of fuel cell power systems for propulsion other than road vehicles
    and auxiliary power units (APU). This part of IEC 62282 covers safety requirements
    for fuel cell power systems intended to be used in electrically powered industrial
    trucks as defined in ISO 5053-1.except for: rough-terrain trucks; non-stacking
    low-lift straddle carriers; stacking high-lift straddle carriers; rough-terrain
    variable-reach trucks; slewing rough-terrain variable-reach trucks; variable-reach
    container handlers; pedestrian propelled trucks. This document applies to gaseous
    hydrogen-fueled fuel cell power systems and direct methanol fuel cell power systems
    for electrically powered industrial trucks. This document applies to DC type fuel
    cell power systems, with a rated output voltage not exceeding 150 V DC for indoor
    and outdoor use.This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2014.This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of the title of this document;<br
    />\r\n- revision of reference standards;<br />\r\n- addition of new subclauses
    (4.3, 4.14.5, 4.15.3, 4.15.4, 4.16, 5.6, and 5.23);<br />\r\n- previous 4.15 was
    revised as “4.16 Risk assessment and risk reduction”;<br />\r\n- revision of 4.6
    3), access to the manual shutoff valve;<br />\r\n- revision of requirements for
    battery terminals that are threaded (4.14.10.1);<br />\r\n- revision of requirements
    for double layer capacitors (4.14.10.2);<br />\r\n- revision of external leakage
    test (5.5) and ultimate strength test (5.7);<br />\r\n- revision of temperature
    limits on capacitors depending on the temperature rating of the material (Table
    3);<br />\r\n- revision of markings that are not relevant (Clause 7);<br />\r\n-
    added “Significant hazards, hazardous situations and events dealt with in this
    document” as a new informative annex."
