  content: "IEC 60034-12:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-12:2024
    specifies the parameters for eight designs of starting performance of single-speed
    three-phase 50 Hz or 60 Hz cage induction motors in accordance with IEC 60034‑1
    that:<br />\r\n- have a rated voltage up to 1 000 V;<br />\r\n- are intended for
    direct-on-line or star-delta starting;<br />\r\n- are rated on the basis of duty
    type S1;<br />\r\n- are constructed to any degree of protection as defined in
    IEC 60034-5 and explosion protection.<br />\r\nThis document also applies to dual
    voltage motors provided that the flux saturation level is the same for both voltages.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2016.
    Aligned with the requirements for explosion protected motors from TC31 WG27<br
    />\r\n- new clause on methods for measuring locked-rotor current and torque;<br
    />\r\n- new informative annex on the general current and torque characteristics
    with locked rotor;<br />\r\n- new informative annex on correction of voltage and
    frequency;<br />\r\n- aligned with the requirements for explosion protected motors
    from TC31 WG27."
