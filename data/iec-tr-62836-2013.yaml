  content: IEC/TR 62836:2013(E), which is a technical report, contains an efficient
    and reliable procedure to test the internal electric field in the insulating materials
    used for high-voltage applications using the pressure wave propagation (PWP) method.
    It is suitable for a sample with homogeneous insulating materials and an electric
    field higher than 1 kV/mm, but it is also depended on the thickness of sample
    and the pressure wave generator.
