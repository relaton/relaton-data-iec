  content: "IEC 60794-1-31:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-1-31:2021
    which is a generic specification, covers optical fibre ribbons. Requirements which
    are described in this part apply to optical fibre ribbon cables for use with telecommunication
    equipment and devices employing similar techniques, in particular optical fibre
    cables in IEC 60794-2 for indoor use, in IEC 60794-3 for outdoor use, in IEC 60794-4
    for self-supporting overhead use, in IEC 60794-5 for air blown use and in IEC
    60794-6 for indoor/outdoor use. The detailed specification can be verified in
    specifications for each application such as IEC 60794-2 and IEC 60794-3. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2018. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    The geometrical requirements for optical fibre ribbon with typically 250 µm coating
    diameter have been modified and those for the optical fibre ribbon with typically
    200 µm coating diameter have been added.<br />\r\n- \"Identification by positional
    identification\" and \"Identification by ribbon coding and fibre colouring\" are
    moved to a new informative Annex A."
