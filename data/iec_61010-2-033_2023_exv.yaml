abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-033:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 61010-2-033:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD1:2016.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-033:2023
    specifies safety requirements for hand-held multimeters and other meters for domestic
    and professional use, capable of measuring mains. Hand-held multimeters are multi-range
    multifunction measuring instruments intended to measure voltage and other electrical
    quantities such as resistance or current. Their primary purpose is to measure
    voltage on a live mains. They are suitable to be supported by one hand during
    normal use. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Clause 2, all normative references have been dated and new normative
    references have been added;<br />\r\nb) 4.4.2.101 is a new subclause about surge
    protective devices;<br />\r\nc) Subclause 6.6.101 modifies 6.6.101 and 6.6.102
    of previous edition:<br />\r\n1) in 6.6.101.1, insulating material of group I
    may be allowed for determination of creepage distances of measuring circuit terminals;<br
    />\r\n2) in 6.6.101.2, Clearances and creepage distances up to 3 000 V for measuring
    circuit terminals in unmated position have been defined;<br />\r\n3) in 6.6.101.3,
    requirements for measuring circuit terminals in partially mated position have
    been specified;<br />\r\n4) in 6.6.101.4, requirements for measuring circuit terminals
    in mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n5) Subclause 6.6.101.5 replaces
    6.6.102;<br />\r\nd) Subclause 6.101 replaces 6.9.101 of the previous edition
    with modifications;<br />\r\ne) 9.101 is a new subclause to consider the protection
    of measuring circuits against the spread of fire and arc flash;<br />\r\nf) in
    9.101.2, relocation of 101.3 of previous edition;<br />\r\ng) in 9.101.3, relocation
    of 101.4 of previous edition;<br />\r\nh) in 101.3, relocation of Clause 102 of
    previous edition;<br />\r\ni) in K.2.1, another method for determination of clearances
    of secondary circuits is proposed;<br />\r\nj) in K.3.2, new Table K.15 and Table
    K.16 for clearance calculation;<br />\r\nk) Clause K.4 of the previous edition
    has been deleted;<br />\r\nl) Subclause K.101.4 has been reviewed;<br />\r\nm)
    Table K.104 of the previous edition has been deleted;<br />\r\nn) Annex AA: Figure
    AA.1 has been redesigned;<br />\r\no) Annex EE: addition of a new informative
    annex for determination of clearances for the purposes of Table 101."
