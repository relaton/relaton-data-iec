    <p>ISO/IEC 13250:2003 (2<sup>nd</sup> edition) specifies two syntaxes for the interchange of Topic Maps. One of these syntaxes is based on the ISO/IEC 10744:1997 (HyTime) meta-DTD (meta Document Type Definition), and it is itself specified as a meta-DTD. The other, called XTM (XML Topic Maps), is specified as an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) DTD.</p>
    <p>Both syntaxes allow the expression of: </p>
    <ul><li> associations between subjects of discourse and zero or more of their names, to be used in various contexts,</li><li> associations between subjects and occurrences (pieces of relevant addressable information),</li><li> user-defined associations among any arbitrary subjects of discourse,</li><li> user-defined subjects which are classes of subjects, including classes of associations and the distinct roles that are played in instances of associations, and</li><li> scopes, expressed as sets of subjects, within the context of which specific associations are meant to be understood as valid and/or relevant.</li></ul>
