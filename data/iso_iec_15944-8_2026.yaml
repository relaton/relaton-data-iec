abstract:
- content: <p>This document:</p><ul><li>provides method(s) for identifying, in Open-edi
    modelling technologies and development of scenarios, the extra requirements in
    Business Operational View (BOV) specifications for identifying the additional
    external constraints to be applied to recorded information in business transactions
    relating to personal information of an individual, as required by legal and regulatory
    requirements of applicable jurisdictional domains having governance over the personal
    information exchanged among parties to a business transaction;</li><li>integrates
    existing normative elements in support of privacy protection requirements as are
    already identified in ISO/IEC 14662 and ISO/IEC 15944-1, ISO/IEC 15944-2, ISO/IEC
    15944-4 and ISO/IEC 15944-5, which apply to information concerning identifiable
    living individuals as buyers in a business transaction or whose personal information
    is used in the business transaction;</li><li>provides overarching operational
    "best practice" statements for associated (and not necessarily automated) processes,
    procedures, practices and governance requirements that need to act in support
    of implementing and enforcing mechanisms needed to support privacy/data protection
    requirements necessary for the implementation in Open-edi transaction environments;</li><li>identifies
    and provides a sample scenario and implementation (use case) for one or more use
    cases of privacy/data protection in business transactions;</li><li>provides guidelines
    on the need for procedural mechanisms in the event that mandatory disclosure rules
    of transactional information that needs to be implemented.</li></ul><p>This document
    does not specify the technical mechanisms needed to implement the Functional Services
    View. Detailed exclusions to the scope of this document are provided in Annex
    H.</p>
