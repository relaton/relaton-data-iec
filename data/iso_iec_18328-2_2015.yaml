abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18328-2:2015 defines physical characteristics and test methods
    for cards with devices, including but not limited to power supplying devices,
    displays, sensors, microphones, loudspeakers, buttons or keypads. This part of
    ISO/IEC 18328 also covers aspects of coexistence of technologies of devices on
    the card and other machine readable card technologies.<p>Additional requirements
    related to biometric capture devices are defined in ISO/IEC 17839â€‘2. Such requirements
    may be applied in addition to the ones defined in this part of ISO/IEC 18328.</p>
