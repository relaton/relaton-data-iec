abstract:
- content: "IEC 61280-1-4:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61280-1-4:2023
    establishes the characterization process of the encircled flux measurement method
    of light sources intended to be used with multimode fibre. This document sets
    forth a procedure for the collection of two-dimensional fibre optic nearfield
    greyscale data and subsequent reduction to one-dimensional data expressed as a
    set of three sampled parametric functions of radius from the fibreâ€™s optical centre.
    Estimation of the fibre core diameter is not an objective of this document. This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    improvement of calibration procedure and calibration traceability;<br />\r\n-
    improvement of fibre shaker description and requirements;<br />\r\n- addition
    of pulsed light sources;<br />\r\n- removal of a poorly traceable calibration
    process using a micro positioner."
