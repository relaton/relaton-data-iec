abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-1:2010 defines an object model with a network-neutral
    interface for connecting processors to communication networks, sensors, and actuators.
    The object model contains blocks, services, and components; it specifies interactions
    with sensors and actuators and forms the basis for implementing application code
    executing in the processor.
