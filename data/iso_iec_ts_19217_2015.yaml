abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TS 19217:2015 describes extensions to the C<strong>++</strong>Programming
    Language (1.2) that enable the specification and checking of constraints on template
    arguments, and the ability to overload functions and specialize class templates
    based on those constraints. These extensions include new syntactic forms and modifications
    to existing language semantics.<p>The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides
    important context and specification for this Technical Specification. This document
    is written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions to modify
    or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly
    to existing text from the International Standard use underlining to represent
    added text and strikethrough to represent deleted text.</p><p>WG21 paper N4191
    defines "fold expressions", which are used to define constraint expressions resulting
    from the use of<em>constrained-parameter</em>s that declare template parameter
    packs. This feature is not present in ISO/IEC 14882:2014, but it is planned to
    be included in the next revision of that International Standard. The specification
    of that feature is included in this document.</p>
