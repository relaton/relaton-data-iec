    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 provides a toolbox consisting of lower layer protocols and physical interfaces. Each</p>
    <p>tool is applicable at one or more of the reference points within the delivery system. The physical delivery media</p>
    <p>that have been identified for this version of ISO/IEC 16500-4 are copper pairs, coaxial cable, microwave, fiber</p>
    <p>and satellite. Removable information carrying physical media (e.g. optical discs and tapes) are not covered. The</p>
    <p>tools listed address the three parts of the delivery system, namely, the core network, the access network and the</p>
    <p>access-network-independent interface to the Set Top Unit (STU). Tools are also identified for the STU dataport</p>
    <p>interface and for a service provider system (SPS) internal network and an SPS/SPS core network.</p>
    <p>Clause 6 specifies in detail the tools provided to digitize the physical media in the core network. In the case of a</p>
    <p>broadband core network, all these tools support high speed ATM transport. Clause 7 specifies in detail the tools</p>
    <p>provided to digitize the physical media in the access network (copper pairs, coax, satellite, microwave, fiber). All</p>
    <p>these tools support high speed MPEG-2-TS transport and/or high speed ATM transport. Clause 8 concerns the</p>
    <p>access-network-independent interface to the STU and provides a detailed specification of the physical interfaces</p>
    <p>between the network interface unit (NIU) and the STU. This physical interface can be internal or external to the</p>
    <p>Set Top Box (STB) and is independent from the physical interface used in the access network. It supports the</p>
    <p>transport of MPEG-2-TS and ATM between NIU and STU. Clause 9 concerns the STU dataport interface and</p>
    <p>specifies the physical interfaces used to connect an STB to various peripheral devices. It defines normative STU</p>
    <p>multimedia dataport tools and interfaces and also includes informative specifications for both PC and parallel</p>
    <p>dataports. These interfaces support the transport of MPEG-2-TS or IP. Clause 10 defines the physical interfaces</p>
    <p>for interconnections between cascaded SPS entities with or without an intervening core network and the physical</p>
    <p>interfaces for networks used to connect various hosts within an SPS.</p>
