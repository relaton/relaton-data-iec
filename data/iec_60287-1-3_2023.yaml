abstract:
- content: IEC 60287-1-3:2023 provides a method for calculating the phase currents
    and circulating current losses in single-core cables arranged in parallel. The
    method described in this document can be used for any number of cables per phase
    in parallel in any physical layout. The phase currents can be calculated for any
    arrangement of sheath bonding. For the calculation of sheath losses, it is assumed
    that the sheaths are bonded at both ends. A method for calculating sheath eddy
    current losses in two circuits in flat formation is given in IEC 60287-1-2.
