abstract:
- content: "IEC 62040-2:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62040-2:2016 is a
    type test product standard for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and applies
    to movable, stationary, fixed or built-in, pluggable and permanently connected
    UPS for use in low-voltage distribution systems with an environment being either
    residential, commercial, light industrial or industrial, which deliver output
    voltage with port voltages not exceeding 1 500 V DC or 1 000 V AC and which include
    an energy storage device. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the inclusion of network
    port limits in Table 1, Table 2 and Annex C for the sake of consistency with other
    standards;<br />\r\nb) a change of quasi-peak limit for category C3 UPS in Table
    2 for the sake of consistency with other standards;<br />\r\nc) a clarification
    in Table 4 about the performance criteria for immunity tests;<br />\r\nd) a revision
    of some test configurations in Annex A.<br />\r\nThe contents of the interpretation
    sheet 1 of June 2018 have been included in this copy."
