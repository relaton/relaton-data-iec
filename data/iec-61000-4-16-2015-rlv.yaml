  content: "IEC 61000-4-16:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-16:2015 relates
    to the immunity requirements and test methods for electrical and electronic equipment
    to conducted, common mode disturbances in the range d.c. to 150 kHz. The object
    of this standard is to establish a common and reproducible basis for testing electrical
    and electronic equipment with the application of common mode disturbances to power
    supply, control, signal and communication ports. It has the status of a basic
    EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide 107. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 1998, Amendment 1:2001 and Amendment
    2:2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
