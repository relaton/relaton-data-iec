abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-18-4:2011 describes the device definition which is compliant with the UPnP
    Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred to herein as
    RADiscoveryAgent device. The RADiscoveryAgent device is a UPnP device that provides
    the functionality capability for synchronizing the UPnP discovery information
    between two remote networks. The Remote Access Discovery Agent functionality is
    a combination of a RADASync service and a control point functionality that interacts
    with a remote RADASync service running on the remote network. Each control point
    is pushing discovery information about devices available in its local area network
    to its corresponding RADASync peer. This device provides control points with the
    following functionality:<br />\r\n- Ability to push discovery information from
    a remote network that will be used to recreate and propagate the original information
    into the local network.<br />\r\n- Ability to propagate multicast events from
    a remote network into the local network."
