  content: "As the global energy landscape shifts toward carbon-neutral sources and
    electrification of industrial, transport, and consumer sectors, the concept of
    an “all-electric society” is rapidly becoming reality. This transformation demands
    a re-thinking of electricity infrastructure, as traditional alternating current
    (AC)-based electricity grids face mounting challenges from rising demand, distributed
    generation, and aging assets. Medium voltage direct current (MVDC) technology
    emerges as a compelling solution to support this transition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    IEC White Paper provides an overview of how MVDC can ease the shift to an all-electric
    society and outlines its strategic value in enhancing power system performance
    and sustainability. It highlights MVDC’s superior power-carrying capacity, improved
    energy efficiency, and better material and resources optimization compared to
    AC systems, while offering advanced control capabilities for active network management.
    The paper also identifies key barriers, including cost, technical maturity, and
    compatibility with legacy systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo help realize MVDC’s benefits,
    the paper recommends IEC and stakeholders to collaborate in encouraging new R&D
    efforts to reduce the technical challenges of MVDC grid operations. Furthermore,
    it stresses the need for targeted standardization efforts in the area and a suggestion
    to establish a dedicated technical committee or subcommittee to harmonize global
    MVDC standards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis white paper has been prepared by a project
    team representing a variety of organizations, working under the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB). The project team included representatives from
    electrical power network businesses, standards organizations and equipment vendors
    from around the world. The project sponsor was Dr Taekyun Kim, President & CEO,
    KEPCO Engineering & Construction Company, Inc. Project management was led by Dr
    Wookyu Chae from Korea Electric Power Corporation. Coordinating author and project
    partner was Dr Glenn Platt from N.OGEE consulting.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC
    White Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/medium-voltage-dc-mvdc-grids-all-electric-society\">free
