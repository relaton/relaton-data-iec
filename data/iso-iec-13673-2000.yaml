    <p>standard addresses the construction and use</p>
    <p>of test suites for verifying conformance of SGML</p>
    <p>systems. Its provisions assist those who build test</p>
    <p>suites, those who build SGML systems to be evaluated</p>
    <p>by such suites, and those who examine an</p>
    <p>SGML system's performance on a test suite as part</p>
    <p>of the process of selecting an SGML tool.</p>
    <p>In particular, this standard includes:</p>
    <p>? criteria for the organization of test suites,</p>
    <p>including naming conventions, documentation</p>
    <p>conventions, and specification of applicable concrete</p>
    <p>syntaxes and features. Among other</p>
    <p>advantages, these conventions facilitate any</p>
    <p>non-SGML automatic processing that may be</p>
    <p>convenient for the developers or the users of the</p>
    <p>tests;</p>
    <p>NOTE ? An example of such non-SGML processing is</p>
    <p>sorting tests by name.</p>
    <p>? a standard form for describing test results</p>
    <p>that makes clear what has been proven or disproven</p>
    <p>by the tests;</p>
    <p>? the specification of a Reference Application</p>
    <p>for SGML Testing (RAST) that interprets all</p>
    <p>markup to allow machine comparison of test</p>
    <p>results for documents conforming to ISO 8879.</p>
    <p>RAST indicates in a standard way when tags,</p>
    <p>processing instructions, and data are recognized</p>
    <p>by the parser, replacing references and processing</p>
    <p>markup declarations and marked sections</p>
    <p>appropriately. RAST tests information likely to be</p>
    <p>passed by a general-purpose SGML parser to an</p>
    <p>application but does not test additional information</p>
    <p>that some parsers provide;</p>
    <p>? the specification of a Reference Application</p>
    <p>for Capacity Testing (RACT) that reports a validating</p>
    <p>parser's capacity calculations. An SGML</p>
    <p>systemthat supports this application indicates its</p>
    <p>ability to report capacity errors regardless of</p>
    <p>whether it supports variant capacity sets;</p>
    <p>? the specification of test procedures related to</p>
    <p>SDIF data streams.</p>
    <p>This standard applies to the testing only of aspects</p>
    <p>of SGML implementation and usage for which</p>
    <p>objective conformance criteria are defined in</p>
    <p>ISO 8879.</p>
    <p>NOTE ? Among the aspects of an SGML system not</p>
    <p>addressed by this standard are error recovery, phrasing</p>
    <p>of error messages, application results, and</p>
    <p>documentation (including the system declaration).</p>
