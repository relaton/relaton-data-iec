  content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is intended for use in a high-performance
    general purpose multistation network and is designed for efficient operation with
    a peak data rate of 100 megabits per second. It uses a token ring architecture.
    This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314 extends the basic FDDI by allowing both multimode
    and single-mode fibre (MMF and SMF respectively) as transmission media. The basic
    FDDI provides for hundreds of stations operating over an extent of many kilometers.
    The individual link lengths supported by the basic FDDI are limited to two (2)
    kilometers by the characteristics of the multimode fibre it specifies. This extension
    to the basic FDDI standard allows links to about 60 kilometers depending on cable
    plant characteristics, by making it possible to include single-mode fibre links
    in a standard FDDI network.
