abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23001-10:2015 defines a storage format for timed metadata metrics.
    The timed metadata metrics can be associated with other tracks in the ISO Base
    Media File Format. Typical timed metadata, quality and power consumption information
    and their metrics, are defined in the specification for carriage in files based
    on the ISO Base Media File Format (ISO/IEC 14496‑12 and ISO/IEC 15444‑12). The
    timed metadata can be used for multiple purposes including supporting dynamic
    adaptive streaming.
