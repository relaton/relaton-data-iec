    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61991:2019 defines requirements
    applied in the design and manufacture of electrical installations and equipment
    to be used on rolling stock to protect persons from electric shocks. This document
    is applicable to rolling stock of rail transport systems, road transport systems
    if they are powered by an external supply (e.g. trolley buses), magnetically levitated
    transport systems, and to the electrical equipment installed in these systems.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2000.
    It is based on EN 50153:2014. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) replacement
    of several reference standards.<br />\r\nb) several terms and abbreviated terms
    are introduced;<br />\r\nc) special national conditions are included in annex</p>"
