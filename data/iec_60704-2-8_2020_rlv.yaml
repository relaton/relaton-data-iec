abstract:
- content: "IEC 60704-2-8:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60704-2-8:2020 applies to
    electric shavers, clippers or trimmers for domestic and similar use, supplied
    from mains or secondary batteries or primary batteries. The term \"similar use\"
    is understood to mean the use in hotels, hospitals, shops, offices, etc. This
    document does not apply to shavers, clippers or trimmers that are powered by means
    other than electrical, for example by a spring-device. If possible, this document
    can also be applied to analogous electrically operated devices, such as depilating
    devices. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the scope of the products has been enlarged to include hair clippers
    and trimmers;<br />\r\nb) it includes standard deviations of sound power levels
    in 1.1.3;<br />\r\nc) the normative references have been updated (ISO 3744:2010
    and ISO 3743-1:2010);<br />\r\nd) it is adjusted with respect to IEC 60704-1:2010;<br
    />\r\ne) it has been updated to comply with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2-8 is intended to be used in conjunction with third edition (2010)
    of IEC 60704-1, Household and similar electrical appliances - Test code for the
    determination of airborne acoustical noise - Part 1: General requirements. This
    Part 2-8 supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 60704-1:2010,
    so as to establish the test code for shavers, hair clippers or trimmers.</p>"
