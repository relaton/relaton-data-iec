abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009 integrates many different types of audio coding:
    natural sound with synthetic sound, low bitrate delivery with high-quality delivery
    and lossless coding, speech with music, complex soundtracks with simple ones,
    and traditional content with interactive and virtual-reality content. By standardizing
    individually sophisticated coding tools - as well as a novel, flexible framework
    for audio synchronization, mixing and downloaded post-production - ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009
    creates adequate technology for a new, interactive world of digital audio.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 14496-3:2009, unlike previous audio standards created by ISO/IEC
    and other groups, does not target a single application such as real-time telephony
    or high-quality audio compression. Rather, it applies to every application requiring
    the use of advanced sound compression, synthesis, manipulation or playback. ISO/IEC
    14496-3:2009 specifies state-of-the-art coding tools in several domains. As these
    tools are integrated with the other parts of ISO/IEC 14496, new possibilities
    for object-based audio coding, interactive presentation, dynamic soundtracks,
    and other sorts of new media are enabled.<br /><br />\r\nSince a single set of
    tools is used to cover the needs of a broad range of applications, interoperability
    is a natural feature of systems that build on ISO/IEC 14496-3:2009."
