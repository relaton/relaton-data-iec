  content: "IEC 61709:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61709:2017
    gives guidance on the use of failure rate data for reliability prediction of electric
    components used in equipment. The method presented in this document uses the concept
    of reference conditions which are the typical values of stresses that are observed
    by components in the majority of applications. Reference conditions are useful
    since they provide a known standard basis from which failure rates can be modified
    to account for differences in environment from the environments taken as reference
    conditions. Each user can use the reference conditions defined in this document
    or use their own. When failure rates stated at reference conditions are used it
    allows realistic reliability predictions to be made in the early design phase.
    The stress models described herein are generic and can be used as a basis for
    conversion of failure rate data given at these reference conditions to actual
    operating conditions when needed and this simplifies the prediction approach.
    Conversion of failure rate data is only possible within the specified functional
    limits of the components. This document also gives guidance on how a database
    of component failure data can be constructed to provide failure rates that can
    be used with the included stress models. Reference conditions for failure rate
    data are specified, so that data from different sources can be compared on a uniform
    basis. If failure rate data are given in accordance with this document then additional
    information on the specified conditions can be dispensed with. This document does
    not provide base failure rates for components – rather it provides models that
    allow failure rates obtained by other means to be converted from one operating
    condition to another operating condition. The prediction methodology described
    in this document assumes that the parts are being used within its useful life.
    The methods in this document have a general application but are specifically applied
    to a selection of component types as defined in Clauses 6 to 20 and I.2. This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2011. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This third edition is a merger of IEC
    61709:2011 and IEC TR 62380:2004.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: addition of
    4.5 Components choice, 4.6 Reliability growth during the deployment phase of new
    equipment, 4.7 How to use this document, and of Clause 19 Printed circuit boards
    (PCB) and Clause 20 Hybrid circuits with respect to IEC TR 62380; addition of
    failure modes of components in Annex A; modification of Annex B, Thermal model
    for semiconductors, adopted and revised from IEC TR 62380; modification of Annex
    D, Considerations on mission profile; modification of Annex E, Useful life models,
    adopted and revised from IEC TR 62380; revision of Annex F (former B.2.6.4), Physics
    of failure; addition of Annex G (former Annex C), Considerations for the design
    of a data base on failure rates, complemented with parts of IEC 60319; addition
    of Annex H, Potential sources of failure rate data and methods of selection; addition
    of Annex J, Presentation of component reliability data, based on IEC 60319.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of October 2019 have been included in this
    copy.<br />\r\nKeywords: failure rate data, reliability prediction of electric
    components"
