abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63214:2019 provides a summary of arguments and a technical basis
    for the development of a new Human Factors Engineering IEC standard and the alignment
    of IEC 60964. Based on the provided argumentation, the participating members will
    vote for such an approach. The proposed content of the new standard provides the
    basis for fruitful discussion within IEC SC 45A WG 8 and raises interest in the
    development of the new standard.<br />\r\nThe scope of the new HFE IEC standard
    will follow a holistic approach towards the design of the plant-wide control rooms
    and all HMI, including e.g. the local control stations located throughout the
    plant. The general principle is to consider the complete nuclear installation
    design as a sociotechnical system, in a holistic and integrated way."
