abstract:
- content: "IEC 60840:2011 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60840:2011 specifies
    test methods and requirements for power cable systems, cables alone and accessories
    alone, for fixed installations and for rated voltages above 30 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub>
    = 36 kV) up to and including 150 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 170 kV). The requirements
    apply to single-core cables and to individually screened three-core cables and
    to their accessories for usual conditions of installation and operation, but not
    to special cables and their accessories, such as submarine cables, for which modifications
    to the standard tests may be necessary or special test conditions may need to
    be devised. This standard does not cover transition joints between cables with
    extruded insulation and paper insulated cables. The significant technical change
    with respect to the previous edition is as follows:<br />\r\n- introduction of
    a prequalification test procedure for cables with high electrical stresses and
    tested as a cable system including accessories.<br />\r\nNOTE: For a more detailed
    history of events leading up to this fourth edition, see the Introduction."
