abstract:
- content: IEC 62652-2:2026, the NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) specification, is
    a common data format for NFC Forum Devices. The NFC Data Exchange Format specification
    defines the NDEF data structure format as well as rules to construct a valid NDEF
    Message as an ordered and unbroken collection of NDEF Records. Furthermore, it
    defines the mechanism for specifying the types of application data encapsulated
    in NDEF Records. The NDEF specification defines only the data structure format
    to exchange application or service specific data in an interoperable way, and
    it does not define any NDEF Record Types in detail - NDEF Record Types are defined
    in separate specifications. This NDEF specification assumes a reliable underlying
    protocol and therefore this specification does not specify the data exchange between
    two NFC Forum Devices. An NFC Forum Device can process the NDEF information independently
    of the way it has received the NDEF Message. Because of the large number of existing
    message encapsulation formats, record marking protocols, and multiplexing protocols,
    it is best to be explicit about the design goals of NDEF and, in particular, about
    what is outside the scope of NDEF.
