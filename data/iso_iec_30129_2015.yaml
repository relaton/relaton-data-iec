abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 30129:2015(E) specifies requirements and recommendations
    for the design and installation of connections (bonds) between various electrically
    conductive elements in buildings and other structures, during their construction
    or refurbishment, in which information technology (IT) and, more generally, telecommunications
    equipment is intended to be installed in order to:\r\na) minimise the risk to
    the correct function of that equipment and interconnecting cabling from electrical
    hazards and\r\nb) provide the telecommunications installation with a reliable
    signal reference - which may improve immunity from electromagnetic interference
    (EMI)."
