    IEC 61970-402:2008(E) provides the base functionality considered necessary and common that is provided by neither the normative standards incorporated by reference nor the new APIs specified in the IEC 61970-403 to IEC 61970-449 generic interface standards. An application is expected to use the Common Services in conjunction with the generic interfaces.
