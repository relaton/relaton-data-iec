abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 62913-2-1 2019 (E) initiates and illustrates the IEC’s systems
    approach based on Use Cases and involving the identification of generic smart
    grid requirements for further standardization work for grid related domains –
    i.e. grid management regrouping: transmission grid management, distribution grid
    management, microgrids and smart substation automation domains – based on the
    methods and tools developed in IEC SRD 62913-1.<br />\r\nThe Grid management domain
    groups Use Cases and associated requirements common to the EHV, HV and MV/LV networks
    operations and the business analysis of the general electric network life cycle.
    Use Cases specific to parts of the general electric network are described in transmission
    grid management, distribution grid management, microgrids and smart substation
    automation clauses.<br />\r\nThis document captures possible “common and repeated
    usage” of a smart grid system, under the format of “Use Cases” with a view to
    feeding further standardization activities. Use Cases can be described in different
    ways and can represent competing alternatives. From there, this document derives
    the common requirements to be considered by these further standardization activities
    in term of interfaces between actors interacting with the given system.<br />\r\nTo
    this end, Use Case implementations are given for information purposes only. The
    interface requirements to be considered for later standardization activities are
    summarized (typically information pieces, communication services and specific
    non-functional requirements: performance level, security specification, etc.)."
