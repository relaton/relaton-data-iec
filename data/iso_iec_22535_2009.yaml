abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    22535:2009 specifies tunnelling of \"QSIG\" over the Session Initiation Protocol
    (SIP) within a corporate telecommunication network (CN).<br />\r\nThe tunnelling
    of QSIG through a public IP network employing SIP is outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    22535:2009. However, the functionality specified in this International Standard
    is in principle applicable to such a scenario when deployed in conjunction with
    other relevant functionality (e.g. address translation, security functions, etc.).<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 22535:2009 is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as
    a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP,
    with QSIG tunnelled within SIP requests and responses."
