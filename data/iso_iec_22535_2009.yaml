abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 22535:2009 specifies tunnelling of "QSIG" over the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) within a corporate telecommunication network (CN).</p><p>The tunnelling
    of QSIG through a public IP network employing SIP is outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    22535:2009. However, the functionality specified in this International Standard
    is in principle applicable to such a scenario when deployed in conjunction with
    other relevant functionality (e.g. address translation, security functions, etc.).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    22535:2009 is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between
    a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP, with QSIG tunnelled
    within SIP requests and responses.</p>
