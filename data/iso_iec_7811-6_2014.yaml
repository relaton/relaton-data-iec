abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7811-6:2014 defines the characteristics for identification
    cards as defined therein and the use of such cards for international interchange.</p><p>It
    specifies requirements for a high coercivity magnetic stripe (including any protective
    overlay) on an identification card, the encoding technique, and coded character
    sets. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states minimum
    requirements.</p><p>Coercivity influences many of the quantities specified in
    ISO/IEC 7811-6:2014 but is not itself specified. The main characteristic of the
    high coercivity magnetic stripe is its improved resistance to erasure. This is
    achieved with minimal probability of damage to other magnetic stripes by contact
    while retaining read compatibility with magnetic stripes as defined in ISO/IEC
    7811-2.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7811-6:2014 provides criteria to which cards are to perform.
    No consideration is given to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the card
    prior to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria is negotiated between
    the involved parties.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10373-2 specifies the test procedures used
    to check cards against the parameters specified in ISO/IEC 7811-6:2014.</p>"
