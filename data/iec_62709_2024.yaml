abstract:
- content: "IEC 62709:2024 applies to security screening systems that utilize X-ray
    radiation and are used to inspect people who are not inside vehicles, containers,
    or enclosures. Specifically, this document applies to systems used to detect objects
    carried on or within the body of the individual being inspected. The objective
    is to provide standard methods of measuring and reporting imaging quality characteristics
    that enable system manufacturers, potential system users and other interested
    parties to:<br />\r\na) Establish a consistent indicator of the expected technical
    performance of screening systems used for the inspection of individuals. Such
    technical performance testing complements explicit detection testing and evaluation.
    In this document \"detection\" refers to items in an image.<br />\r\nb) Provide
    repeatable and verifiable imaging performance data that can be used to compare
    systems from different vendors.<br />\r\nc) Establish a baseline that can be used
    over time to calibrate the system or detect any performance degradation. (It is
    not intended that the entire test method be employed for daily quality assurance
    testing.)<br />\r\nd) Establish minimum acceptable performance requirements for
    the systems described above.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2014. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Clarified
    the test procedures to maintain consistency with IEC 62463.<br />\r\nb) Changed
    the term \"spatial resolution\" to \"pentalith resolution\".<br />\r\nc) Modified
    some standard test conditions.<br />\r\nd) Modified some terms and definitions.<br
    />\r\ne) Changed the imaging requirements for transmission general-use systems."
