  content: IEC TR 62240-2:2018(E) describes a process and a method for selecting digital
    semiconductor microcircuits by ensuring that their lifetime is compatible with
    the requirements of aerospace, defence and high performance (ADHP) applications
    (generally in connection with functional environments). Methods and guidelines
    are provided to assess the long term reliability of COTS semiconductor microcircuits
    in such applications; they mainly apply during the electronic design phase when
    selecting semiconductor microcircuits and assessing the application reliability.
    focuses on original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) using commercial off the shelf
    (COTS) semiconductor microcircuits for high performance, high reliability and
    long duration applications. This document supports OEMs in the preparation and
    maintenance of their semiconductor electronic component management plan (ECMP).
