abstract:
- content: "<p>The models defined in ISO/IEC 9594-2:2017 provide a conceptual and
    terminological framework for the other ITU-T X.500-series Recommendations | parts
    of ISO/IEC 9594 which define various aspects of the Directory.</p><p>The functional
    and administrative authority models define ways in which the Directory can be
    distributed, both functionally and administratively. Generic Directory System
    Agent (DSA) and DSA information models and an Operational Framework are also provided
    to support Directory distribution.</p><p>The generic Directory Information Models
    describe the logical structure of the Directory Information Base (DIB) from the
    perspective of Directory and Administrative Users. In these models, the fact that
    the Directory is distributed, rather than centralized, is not visible.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    9594-2:2017 provides a specialization of the generic Directory Information Models
    to support Directory Schema administration.</p>"
