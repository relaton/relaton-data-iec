  content: IEC/TR 61804-6:2012(E) provides an evaluation and assessment of electronic
    device description language (EDDL) technology. It provides guidance to device
    and system manufacturers for how EDDL technology can help them meet user requirements.
    It provides guidance to system integrators, as well as instrumentation and maintenance
    practitioners at end-user companies, on how EDDL technology can help them integrate
    systems and incorporate device management in their work processes. It gives examples
    of requirements from the NAMUR NE 105 recommendation. It's intent is to illustrate
    how EDDL technology and products based on EDDL technology meet these requirements.
