abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 62443-2-2: 2025 provides guidance on the development, validation,
    operation, and maintenance of a set of technical, physical, and process security
    measures called Security Protection Scheme (SPS). The document’s goal is to provide
    the asset owner implementing an IACS Security Program (SP) with mechanisms and
    procedures to ensure that the design, implementation and operation of an SPS manage
    the risks resulting from cyberthreats to each of the IACS included in its operating
    facility.<br />\r\nThe document is based on contents specified in other documents
    of the IEC 62443 series and explains how these contents can be used to support
    the development of technical, physical, and process security measures addressing
    the risks to the IACS during the operation phase."
