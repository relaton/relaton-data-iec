abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 20968:2002 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities
    of the MkII FPA Functional Size Measurement Method.The method can be used to measure
    the functional size of any software application that can be described in terms
    of logical transactions, each comprising an input, process and output component.
    The sizing rules were designed to apply to application software from the domain
    of business information systems, where the processing component of each transaction
    tends to be dominated by considerations of the storage or retrieval of data. The
    method may be applicable to software from other domains, but the user should note
    that the sizing rules do not take into account contributions to size such as from
    complex algorithms as typically found in scientific and engineering software,
    nor do the rules specifically take into account real-time requirementsMK II FPA
    is independent of the project management method to be used and of the development
    method employed. It is a measure of the logical, business requirements, independent
    of how they are implemented.
