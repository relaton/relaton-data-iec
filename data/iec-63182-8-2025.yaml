  content: "IEC 63182-8:2025 specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical
    interchangeability for a preferred range of U-cores made of metallic magnetic
    powder and gives guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable
    to U-cores.<br />\r\nThis document is a specification that is useful in the negotiations
    between magnetic powder core manufacturers and customers about surface irregularities.<br
    />\r\nThe use of \"derived\" standards which give more detailed specifications
    of component parts while still permitting conformance with this document is discussed
    in Annex A."
