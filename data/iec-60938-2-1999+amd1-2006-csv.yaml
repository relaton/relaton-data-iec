    Applies to fixed conductors designed for electromagnetic interference suppression and which fall within the scope of the generic spedification, IEC 60938-1. It is restricted to fixed inductors for which safety tests are appropriate. This implies that inductors specified according to this specification will either be connected to mains supplies, when compliance with the mandatory test of table 1 is necessary, or used in other circuit positions where the equipment specification prescribes that some or all of these safety tests are required. It applies to fixed inductors which will be connected to an a.c. mains or other supply with a nominal voltage not exceeding 1 000 V a.c.(r.m.s.) or d.c. between conductors and with a nominal frequency not exceeding 400 Hz.
