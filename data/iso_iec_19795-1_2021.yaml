abstract:
- content: "This document:<br />\r\n- establishes general principles for testing the
    performance of biometrics systems in terms of error rates and throughput rates
    for purposes including measurement of performance, prediction of performance,
    comparison of performance, and verifying conformance with specified performance
    requirements;<br />\r\n- specifies performance metrics for biometric systems;<br
    />\r\n- specifies requirements on the recording of test data and reporting of
    test results; and<br />\r\n- specifies requirements on test protocols in order
    to:<br />\r\n- reduce bias due to inappropriate data collection or analytic procedures;<br
    />\r\n- help achieve the best estimate of field performance for the expended effort;<br
    />\r\n- improve understanding of the limits of applicability of the test results.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to empirical performance testing of biometric
    systems and algorithms through analysis of the comparison scores and decisions
    output by the system, without requiring detailed knowledge of the systemâ€™s algorithms
    or of the underlying distribution of biometric characteristics in the population
    of interest.<br />\r\nNot within the scope of this document is the measurement
    of error and throughput rates for people deliberately trying to subvert the intended
    operation of the biometric system (e.g. by presentation attacks)."
