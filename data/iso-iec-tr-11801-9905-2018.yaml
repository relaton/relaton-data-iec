  content: This Technical Report provides guidance to determine whether and which
    installed channels will support 25GBASE-T. It also provides mitigation procedures
    to improve the performance of installed channels to the point where the 25GBASE-T
    application is supported. Additionally, it recommends the use of Class I and Class
    II channels to support 25GBASE-T in new installations.
