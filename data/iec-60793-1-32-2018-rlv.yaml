  content: "IEC 60793-1-32:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-32:2018
    is intended primarily for testing either fibres as produced by a fibre manufacturer
    or subsequently overcoated (tight buffered) using various polymers. The test can
    be performed either on fibres as produced, or after exposure to various environments.
    This test applies to A1, A2, A3, B and C fibres with a nominal glass dimension
    of 125 µm. The object of this document is to establish uniform requirements for
    the mechanical characteristic – coating strippability. This test quantifies the
    force required to mechanically remove the protective coating from optical fibres
    along their longitudinal axis. This test is not intended as a means to maximize
    fibre strength after the coating is removed nor is it intended to specify the
    best conditions for field stripping of optical fibres. This test is designed for
    optical fibres having polymeric coatings with nominal outer diameters in the range
    of 200 µm to 900 µm. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical change with respect to the previous
    edition: expansion of the range of coating dimensions applicable to the procedure
    detailed in this document to accommodate optical fibres with a 200 µm coating
    dimension.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: coating strippability, protective coating
    of optical fibres"
