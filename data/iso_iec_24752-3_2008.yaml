abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24752 facilitates operation of information and electronic products
    through remote and alternative interfaces and intelligent agents.ISO/IEC 24752-3:2008
    defines a language (presentation template markup language) for describing modality-independent
    user interface specifications, or presentation templates, associated with a user
    interface socket description as defined by ISO/IEC 24752-2.The purpose of a presentation
    template is to provide the universal remote console (URC) defined in ISO/IEC 24752-1
    with hints as to how to build a usable and consistent user interface for a target
    device or service that is described in a user interface socket description as
    referenced above. The hints are of an abstract nature, and are intended to apply
    to any delivery context. These hints primarily provide information on structuring,
    grouping and linearization of the socket elements.Elements within a presentation
    template can be referenced by atomic resources whose format is given by ISO/IEC
    24752-5. Taken together, a presentation template, socket description, and appropriate
    atomic resources can be used to construct a user interface in any modality (e.g.
    visual, auditory, tactile, multimodal), through which a user can access and control
    a target.
