  content: "IEC 61215-1-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61215-1-1:2021 lays
    down requirements for the design qualification of terrestrial photovoltaic modules
    suitable for long-term operation in open-air climates. The useful service life
    of modules so qualified will depend on their design, their environment and the
    conditions under which they are operated. Test results are not construed as a
    quantitative prediction of module lifetime. In climates where 98th percentile
    operating temperatures exceed 70 °C, users are recommended to consider testing
    to higher temperature test conditions as described in IEC TS 63126. This document
    is intended to apply to all crystalline silicon terrestrial flat plate modules.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61215-1-1, issued
    in 2016. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. A cyclic (dynamic) mechanical load
    test (MQT 20) added.<br />\r\nb. A test for detection of potential-induced degradation
    (MQT 21) added.<br />\r\nc. A bending test (MQT 22) for flexible modules added.<br
    />\r\nd. A procedure for stress specific stabilization – BO LID (MQT 19.3) added.<br
    />\r\ne. A final stabilization procedure for modules undergoing PID testing added</p>"
