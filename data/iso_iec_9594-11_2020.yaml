abstract:
- content: "The scope of this Recommendation | International Standard is threefold.<br
    />\r\nThis Recommendation | International Standard provides guidance on how to
    prepare new and old protocols for cryptographic algorithm migration, and defines
    auxiliary cryptographic algorithms to be used for migration purposes.<br />\r\nThis
    Recommendation | International Standard specifies a general wrapper protocol that
    provides authentication, integrity and confidentiality (encryption) protection
    for other protocols. This wrapper protocol includes a migration path for cryptographic
    algorithms allowing for smooth migration to stronger cryptographic algorithms
    as such requirements evolve. This will allow migration to quantum-safe cryptographic
    algorithms. Protected protocols can then be developed without taking security
    and cryptographic algorithms into consideration.<br />\r\nThis Recommendation
    | International Standard also includes some protocols to be protected by the wrapper
    protocol primarily for support of public-key infrastructure (PKI). Other specifications,
    e.g., Recommendations or International Standards, may also develop protocols designed
    to be protected by the wrapper protocol."
