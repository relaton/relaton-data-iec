  content: "IEC/TR 62283:2010(E) gives a short summary of the radiation exposure in
    certain environments and applications and the different radiation effects on fibres.
    It also describes the most important radiation effect, i.e. the increase of transmission
    loss, and its strong dependence on a variety of fibre properties and test conditions.
    These dependencies need to be known in order to perform appropriate tests for
    each specific application as well as to understand, compare and qualify the test
    results obtained at different laboratories when performed according to IEC 60793-1-54,
    Optical fibres - Part 1-54: Measurement methods and test procedures - Gamma irradiation.
    The main changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n- Clause 5
    now also covers industrial environment,<br />\r\n- A new Clause 9 has been added
    to deal with \"measurement techniques and quality assurance of attenuation measurements\"."
