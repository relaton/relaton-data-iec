abstract:
- content: |-
    Presents measurement procedures that enable noise emissions of a wind turbine to be characterized with respect to a range of wind speeds and directions. Allows comparisons between different wind turbines. May be applied by wind turbine manufacturers, purchasers, operators and planners or regulators.<strong>This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2002) and its amendment 1 (2006). Therefore, no need to order amendment in
    addition to this publication.</strong><br /><br />This publication is of high relevance for Smart Grid.
