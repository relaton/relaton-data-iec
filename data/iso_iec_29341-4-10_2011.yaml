abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-4-10:2011 Describes the service type which enables control over the transport
    of audio and video streams. The service type defines a common model for A/V transport
    control suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide
    variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players,
    VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to
    control tuners. This service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0. This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-10, first edition,
    published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision."
