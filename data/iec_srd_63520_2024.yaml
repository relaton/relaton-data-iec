abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63520:2024, which is a Systems Reference Deliverable (SRD), provides
    the concept system of energy challenges in smart cities, using the methodology
    framework and development processes in IEC SRD 63235.<br />\r\nThis document is
    applicable to development and improvement of the terms and concepts relevant to
    energy challenges in smart cities.<br />\r\nAs global climate change and energy
    scarcity become increasingly prominent, it is important that cities and stakeholders
    proactively address energy challenges to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.
    According to the IEC White Paper Coping with the Energy Challenge – The IEC's
    role from 2010 to 2030, cities are facing the following major energy challenges:
    stabilizing climate impact from fossil fuel use; meeting the energy demands of
    a growing urban population; bringing electricity to citizens without access; ensuring
    stable and secure energy access for all cities.<br />\r\nCities are very complex
    \"system of systems\", including power grid (energy), industry, buildings, transport,
    water, waste and other domains, each of which plays an important role. Various
    domains play an important role in coping with urban energy challenges. On the
    one hand, not only is it important for the power grid domain to be transformed,
    but also for industry, buildings, transport and other domains to take proactive
    measures. Therefore, it is essential for stakeholders in different domains to
    reach a consensus on energy challenges (including but not limited to the intension,
    solutions, visions, etc.), which is conducive to improving the pertinency, systematization
    and effectiveness of the city's response to energy challenges. On the other hand,
    from the perspective of urban governance, it is not the most effective for each
    domain to cope with energy challenges independently, and the comprehensive governance
    capacity of cities to cope with energy challenges can be significantly improved
    through cross-domain collaboration, interoperability and integration.<br />\r\nSemantic
    interoperability is proposed by the IEC White Paper Semantic Interoperability:
    challenges in the digital transformation age. Research on semantic interoperability
    is being carried out or planned in the future in the domains of city, power grid
    (energy), industry, buildings, transport, etc. For example, in the domain of city,
    IEC SRD 63476-1 provides a gap analysis of smart city ontology; in the domain
    of power grid (energy), IEC SRD 63417:–[1] provides guidance and planning for
    the development of smart energy ontologies. Domain-based ontologies have been
    developed for semantic interoperability in a specific domain, but there is a lack
    of cross-domain semantic interoperability research. IEC SRD 63417:– includes the
    following recommendation: \"Start a joint work with IEC SyC Smart Cities and IEC
    SyC Smart Energy on cross domain ontologies\".<br />\r\nFrom the perspective of
    urban governance, focusing on cross-domain semantic interoperability and at the
    same time considering the diversity of technology application in rural and remote
    areas, this document builds a concept system for energy challenges in smart cities,
    covering core concepts such as intension, stakeholders, solutions and visions
    of energy challenges. As semantic interoperability research is being carried out
    or planned in power grid (energy), industry, buildings, transport and other domains,
    SyC Smart Cities will not be involved in semantic interoperability within these
    domains. The concept system of this document contains the core concepts of the
    city domain and the core concepts of cross-domain. The core concepts relevant
    to energy challenges in other domains, such as power grid (energy), industry,
    buildings, transport, etc., are developed for semantic interoperability within
    each domain and fall outside the scope of this document. The purpose of this document
    includes, but is not limited to:<br />\r\nfostering the coordination of perspectives
    on energy challenges among stakeholders in different domains of city, and helping
    stakeholders identify the intension, solutions, visions, etc. of energy challenges;<br
    />\r\nproviding a basic framework for semantic coherence and standardization of
    energy challenges in different domains of city, and promoting cross-domain collaboration,
    interoperability and integration;<br />\r\nhelping relevant standards development
    organizations (SDOs) identify gaps in concepts and standards related to energy
    challenges in smart cities.<br />\r\nThis document provides a basic framework
    for cities to adopt top-down, bottom up and federated planning and design, engineering
    construction, management and operation, standard setting and other measures to
    effectively respond to energy challenges. This document promotes the collaboration,
    integration and sustainable development of global smart cities.<br /><br /><br
