- content: "IEC 60695-2-21:2023, which is a Technical Specification, specifies a fire
    containment test method for finished units. It is intended to verify the capability
    of containing of a fire event generated by an effective ignition source inside
    a finished unit.<br />\r\nUnless otherwise specified by the relevant product standard,
    determination of the fire containment described in this document does not apply
    to any of the following:<br />\r\n- A single electrical component;<br />\r\n-
    A single electrical component when incorporated into a finished unit;<br />\r\n-
    Electrical installation products such as distribution boards, circuit protection
    devices, switchgear, controlgear, cable management system and electrical accessories
