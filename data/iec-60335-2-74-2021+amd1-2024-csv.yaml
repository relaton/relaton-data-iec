  content: "IEC 60335-2-74:2021+AMD1:2024 CSV deals with the safety of portable electric
    immersion heaters for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use
    but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may
    be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– heating elements incorporated in portable appliances, such as appliances
    for heating liquids (IEC 60335 2 15);<br />\r\n– aquarium heaters (IEC 60335-2-55);<br
    />\r\n– fixed immersion heaters (IEC 60335-2-73)<br />\r\n– battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2002, Amendment 1: 2006 and Amendment 2:2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC
    60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause
    1, 7.1);<br />\r\nc) requirements for appliances that maintain a liquid at a set
    temperature are added (19.1, 30.2).<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
