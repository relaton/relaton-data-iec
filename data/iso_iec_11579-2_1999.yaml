abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 11579 specifies a reference configuration (RC)
    for high-speed private integrated services</p><p>network exchanges (HS-PINX),
    for their interconnection to form high-speed private integrated services networks</p><p>(HS-PISN).
    The configuration is intended to provide guidance for the specification of PINX
    capabilities, but does not</p><p>impose any specific implementation of a HS-PINX.</p><p>This
    RC describes a conceptual HS-PINX. By combining multiple HS-PINXs to a high-speed
    private integrated</p><p>services network the RC becomes applicable to a HS-PISN.
    This is generically described in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>This RC satisfies the
    support of all HS applications, such as LAN, MAN, B-ISDN, etc.</p>"
