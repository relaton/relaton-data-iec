  content: "IEC TR 63368:2024 provides guidance on off-site real-time simulation tests
    of control and protection (C&P) systems for HVDC power transmission systems. The
    off-site real-time simulation tests are carried out after the testing of C&P devices
    and prior to on-site system tests.<br />\r\nThis document covers point-to-point,
    back-to-back, and multi-terminal HVDC systems of line commutated converters (LCC),
    voltage-sourced converters (VSC) and hybrid HVDC technologies.<br />\r\nIn order
    to provide practical guidance for the functional performance tests of HVDC power
    transmission systems, this document covers the test environment, the contents
    and methods of functional performance tests, and the test report."
