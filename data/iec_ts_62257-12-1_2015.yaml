- content: |-
    IEC TS 62257-12-1:2015(E) applies to lamps and lighting appliances for off-grid electricity systems with the following characteristics:<br />
    - The power supply is AC or DC:<br />
    - AC nominal voltages up to 250 V;<br />
    - DC nominal voltages up to 48 V. The light source is CFL, linear fluorescent, or LED. Operation of the lamp or lighting appliance does not require any components to be supplied by the testing laboratory other than lampholders, wire, connectors, and a power supply. The lamp or lighting appliance does not include a battery or energy source (for example, a photovoltaic module or electromechanical generator). This new edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: Overall, the narrow focus on the needs of bulk procurement programmes has been shifted to a wider framework for structuring quality assurance using appropriate methods for a range of stakeholders including governments, manufacturers, buyers, and others. The scope has been expanded from self-ballasted compact fluorescent lamps to include DC products and lighting appliances with LED, compact fluorescent, or linear fluorescent light sources.<br /><br />This publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62257 series.
