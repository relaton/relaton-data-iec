  content: "IEC TR 63486:2024 provides a cybersecurity framework for digital I&C programmable
    systems [2]. IEC 62645 [1] aligns strongly with the information security management
    system (ISMS) elements detailed within ISO/IEC 27001:2013 [2]. The ISO/IEC ISMS
    structure corresponds to the “I&C digital programmable system cybersecurity program”
    in the context (as defined in 5.2.1 of IEC 62645:2019 [1]).<br />\r\nThe scope
    of this document is to capture the national and international cyber-risk approaches
    employed to manage cybersecurity risks associated with Instrumentation and Control
    (I&C) and Electrical Power Systems (EPS) at a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP).<br />\r\nThis
    document summarizes an evaluation of cyber-risk approaches that are in use by
    nuclear facility operators to manage cybersecurity risks.<br />\r\nThe scope of
    this document generally follows the exclusions of IEC 62645 which are:<br />\r\n-
    Non-malevolent actions and events such as accidental failures, human errors (except
    those stated above, such as impacting the performance of cybersecurity controls),
    and natural events. In particular, good practices for managing applications and
    data, including backup and restoration related to accidental failure, are out
    of scope.<br />\r\nThis document summarizes key insights of the international
    and cyber-risk approaches used at NPPs regarding the application of ISO/IEC 27005:2018
    [5]. The evaluation is based on 11 challenges to cybersecurity risk management
    and their applicability to NPP risk management. The challenges are detailed in
    Clause 7. This document also relates the risk management elements of IEC 62645
    and IEC 63096."
