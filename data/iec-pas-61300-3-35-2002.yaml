    Quantitatively assess the endface quality of a polished fiber optic connector. The information is intended for use with other standards which set requirements for allowable surface defects such as scratches, pits and debris which may affect optical performance. In general, the methods described in this document apply to fibers
    contained within a ferrule, however portions are applicable to non-ferruled connectors. Those portions are identified where appropriate.
