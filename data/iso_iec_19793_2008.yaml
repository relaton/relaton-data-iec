abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19793:2008 defines use of the Unified Modeling Language (UML 2.1.1
    Superstructure Specification, OMG document formal/07-02-05) for expressing system
    specifications in terms of the viewpoint specifications defined by the Reference
    Model of Open Distributed Processing (ISO/IEC 10746, Parts 1 to 4) and the Enterprise
    Language (ISO/IEC 15414). It covers the expression of a system specification in
    terms of RM-ODP viewpoint specifications using defined UML concepts and extensions
    (e.g. structuring rules, technology mappings, etc.) and relationships between
    the resultant RM-ODP viewpoint specifications. ISO/IEC 19793:2008 is intended
    to be used by ODP modellers who want to use the UML notation for expressing their
    ODP specifications in a graphical and standard way, UML modellers who want to
    use the RM-ODP concepts and mechanisms to structure their UML system specifications,
    and modelling tool suppliers, who wish to develop UML-based tools that are capable
    of expressing RM-ODP viewpoint specifications.
