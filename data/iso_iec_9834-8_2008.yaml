abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 specifies the format and generation rules that enable
    users to produce128-bit identifiers that are either guaranteed to be globally
    unique, or are globally unique with a high probability.<br /><br />\r\nThe UUIDs
    generated in conformance with ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 are suitable either fortransient
    use, with generation of a new UUID every 100 nanoseconds, or as persistent identifiers.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 is derived from earlier non-standard specifications
    of UUIDs and theirgeneration, and is technically identical to those earlier specifications.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 specifies the procedures for the operation of
    a Web-based RegistrationAuthority for UUIDs.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 9834-8:2008
    also specifies and allows the use of UUIDs (registered or not registered) as primary
    values (which define Unicode labels) for arcs beneath the Joint UUID arc. This
    enables users to generateand use such arcs without any registration procedures.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 also specifies and allows the use of UUIDs (registered
    or not registered) to form a URN."
