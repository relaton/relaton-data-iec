abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14908-3:2011 specifies the control network Power Line (PL) channel
    and serves as a companion document to ISO/IEC 14908-1. It presents the information
    necessary for the development of a PL physical network and nodes to communicate
    and share information over that network. ISO/IEC 14908-3:2011 covers the complete
    physical layer (OSI layer 1) including the interface to the Medium Access Control
    (MAC) sublayer and the interface to the medium. It includes parameters specific
    to the PL channel type, even though the parameters may be controlled at an OSI
    layer other than layer 1. ISO/IEC 14908-3:2011 also provides a set of guideline
    physical and electrical specifications for the power line environment as an aid
    in developing products for that environment.
