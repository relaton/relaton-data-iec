abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14908-3:2011 specifies the control network Power Line (PL)
    channel and serves as a companion document to ISO/IEC 14908-1. It presents the
    information necessary for the development of a PL physical network and nodes to
    communicate and share information over that network.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14908-3:2011
    covers the complete physical layer (OSI layer 1) including the interface to the
    Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer and the interface to the medium. It includes
    parameters specific to the PL channel type, even though the parameters may be
    controlled at an OSI layer other than layer 1. ISO/IEC 14908-3:2011 also provides
    a set of guideline physical and electrical specifications for the power line environment
    as an aid in developing products for that environment.</p>"
