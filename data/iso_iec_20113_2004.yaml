abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 20113:2004 specifies supplementary service Make Call Request
    (SS-MCR), which is related, but not limited to, various basic services supported
    by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified
    in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>The supplementary service MCR enables a Requesting User
    to request a Co-operating User to establish a new Requested Call to a Destination
    User. This new Requested Call between the Co-operating and Destination User can
    be either a Basic call or call independent signalling connection.</p><p>Service
    specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 20113:2004 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of SS-MCR. The stage 1 specification specifies the supplementary service as seen
    by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification specifies the functional entities
    involved in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>"
