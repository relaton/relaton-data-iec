abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 20113:2004 specifies supplementary
    service Make Call Request (SS-MCR), which is related, but not limited to, various
    basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic
    services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>The supplementary service MCR enables
    a Requesting User to request a Co-operating User to establish a new Requested
    Call to a Destination User. This new Requested Call between the Co-operating and
    Destination User can be either a Basic call or call independent signalling connection.</p><p>Service
    specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 20113:2004 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of SS-MCR. The stage 1 specification specifies the supplementary service as seen
    by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification specifies the functional entities
    involved in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>
