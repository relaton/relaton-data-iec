abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20113:2004 specifies supplementary service Make Call Request (SS-MCR), which is
    related, but not limited to, various basic services supported by Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nThe
    supplementary service MCR enables a Requesting User to request a Co-operating
    User to establish a new Requested Call to a Destination User. This new Requested
    Call between the Co-operating and Destination User can be either a Basic call
    or call independent signalling connection.<br />\r\nService specifications are
    produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC
    20113:2004 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-MCR. The stage
    1 specification specifies the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs.
    The stage 2 specification specifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary
    service and the information flows between them."
