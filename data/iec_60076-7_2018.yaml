abstract:
- content: "IEC 60076-7:2018 is applicable to mineral-oil-immersed transformers. It
    describes the effect of operation under various ambient temperatures and load
    conditions on transformer life. This document provides guidance for the specification
    and loading of power transformers from the point of view of operating temperatures
    and thermal ageing. It provides recommendations for loading above the nameplate
    rating and guidance for the planner to choose appropriate rated quantities and
    loading conditions for new installations. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    title has been updated from \"oil-immersed power transformers\" to \"mineral-oil-immersed
    transformers\";<br />\r\nb) insulation life is updated by considering latest research
    findings;<br />\r\nc) temperature limits have been reviewed and maximum core temperature
    is recommended;<br />\r\nd) number of fibre optic sensors is recommended for temperature
    rise test;<br />\r\ne) Q, S and H factors are considered;<br />\r\nf) thermal
    models are revised and rewritten in generally applicable mathematical form;<br
    />\r\ng) geomagnetic induced currents are briefly discussed and corresponding
    temperature limits are suggested;<br />\r\nh) extensive literature review has
    been performed and a number of references added to bibliography."
