abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61400-12-4:2020 summarizes the current state of the art in numerical
    flow modelling, existing guidelines and past benchmarking experience in numerical
    model validation and verification. Based on the work undertaken, the document
    identifies the important technical aspects for using flow simulation over terrain
    for wind application as well as the existing open issues including recommendations
    for further validation through benchmarking tests.
