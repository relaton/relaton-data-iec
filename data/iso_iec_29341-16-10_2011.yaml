abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-16-10:2011 describes a service definition which is compliant with the UPnP
    Device Architecture version 1.0.service. This service-type enables modelling of
    \"Basic Power Management Proxy\" function capabilities. Basic Power Management
    Proxy (BPMPX) is a combination of UPnP service and a control point. As Control
    Point, Proxy discovers and controls Low Power Device services running in the network,
    and as UPnP Proxy service, it advertises itself to the network, and responds to
    actions from low power aware Control Point. [LPARCH] Basic functions that BPMPX
    does are as follows:<br />\r\n- Receive multicast discovery messages from power
    managed UPnP devices in order to be. aware of their power states (i.e. the BPMPX
    will act as Control Point).<br />\r\n- Send multicast or unicast discovery messages
    (i.e. M-SEARCH) to query UPnP devices and keep track of their power states (i.e.
    the BPMPX will act as Control Point).<br />\r\n- Send GetPowerManagementInfo action
    to obtain power management mechanism provided by power-aware devices.<br />\r\n-
    Should send the appropriate wakeup message to the specified sleeping device when
    it receives WakeupDevice action from power aware Control Point. [LPARCH]. Act
    as UPnP service.<br />\r\n- Sending BPMPX service announcements and M-Search replies.<br
    />\r\n- Respond to SearchSleepingDevices action to provide the information of
    sleeping devices in network.<br />\r\n- Respond to Wakeup action from Control
    Point. (Wake up action is directed to the low power devices and not for waking
    up the BPMPX)."
