abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    primary goal of ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is to provide a notation that is readily understandable
    by all business users, from the business analysts that create the initial drafts
    of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the
    technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people
    who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus, ISO/IEC 19510:2013 creates
    a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process
    implementation. ISO/IEC 19510:2013 represents the amalgamation of best practices
    within the business modelling community to define the notation and semantics of
    Collaboration diagrams, Process diagrams, and Choreography diagrams. The intent
    of ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is to standardize a business process model and notation
    in the face of many different modelling notations and viewpoints. In doing so,
    ISO/IEC 19510:2013 will provide a simple means of communicating process information
    to other business users, process implementers, customers, and suppliers. ISO/IEC
    19510:2013 is identical to OMG BPMN 2.0.1."
