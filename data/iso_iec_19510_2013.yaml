abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>The primary goal of ISO/IEC 19510:2013
    is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users,
    from the business analysts that create the initial drafts of the processes, to
    the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will
    perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and
    monitor those processes. Thus, ISO/IEC 19510:2013 creates a standardized bridge
    for the gap between the business process design and process implementation.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19510:2013 represents the amalgamation of best practices within the business modelling
    community to define the notation and semantics of Collaboration diagrams, Process
    diagrams, and Choreography diagrams. The intent of ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is to standardize
    a business process model and notation in the face of many different modelling
    notations and viewpoints. In doing so, ISO/IEC 19510:2013 will provide a simple
    means of communicating process information to other business users, process implementers,
    customers, and suppliers.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19510:2013 is identical to OMG BPMN 2.0.1.</p>
