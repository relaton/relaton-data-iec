abstract:
- content: "IEC 61812-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61812-1:2023
    applies to time relays and coupling relays for industrial applications (for example
    control, automation, signal and industrial equipment) and for automatic electrical
    controls for use in, on, or in association with equipment for residential and
    similar use.<br />\r\nThe term “relay” as used in this document comprises all
    types of time relays and coupling relays, other than measuring relays. This document
    defines type test and routine test to confirm the service condition. Subclause
    3.2 provides definitions for different types of time relays in use in the IEC
    61812 series. IEC 61812-1:2023 cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) update of references;<br />\r\nb) addition of requirements for risk assessment;<br
    />\r\nc) addition of requirements for routine test;<br />\r\nd) renumbering of
    clauses to bring them into a more logical order;<br />\r\ne) clarification of
    the requirement for shock;<br />\r\nf) addition of cybersecurity requirements
    for industrial automation and control systems;<br />\r\ng) addition of environmentally
    conscious design requirement;<br />\r\nh) addition of common data dictionary reference;<br
    />\r\ni) addition of terms and definitions of relay types;<br />\r\nj) addition
    of coupling relays in title;<br />\r\nk) addition of coupling relays in scope."
