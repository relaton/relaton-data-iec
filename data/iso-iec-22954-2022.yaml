    <p>This document specifies a method of automated colour profile distribution to large format inkjet printers.</p>
    <p>This document applies to digital colour printers and their printer controllers for which ICC colour management is necessary or desired. This document also applies to the print settings profile providers.</p>
    <p>The extent of automation covered includes the printer controller acquiring information about the overall situation, connecting to a print settings profile provider on the Internet, determining the best possible profile to download (if it exists), and downloading and installation of the profile.</p>
    <p>This document covers general concepts and procedures and does not go into a level of detail necessary to establish syntactic or semantic interoperability. This document covers ICC version 4 output profiles as specified by ISO 15076-1, but does not cover device link profiles.</p>
