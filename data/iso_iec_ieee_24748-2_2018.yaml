abstract:
- content: "This document is a guideline for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015.
    It addresses system, life cycle, organizational, project, and process, concept
    application, principally through reference to ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748‑1 and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2015. It gives guidance on applying ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 from the aspects
    of strategy, planning, application in organizations, and application on projects.
    It also provides comparison of the differences between ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015
    and the prior versions, ISO/IEC 15288:2008.<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    to be consistent with both ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748‑1 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 in
    its treatment of life-cycle concepts and systems engineering processes.<br />\r\nNOTE
    Systems engineering for defense programs is addressed in IEEE Std 15288.1, Application
    of Systems Engineering on Defense Programs."
