abstract:
- content: "IEC GUIDE 120:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC Guide 120:2023
    provides guidelines on the security aspects included in IEC publications, and
    how to implement them. These guidelines can be used as a checklist for the combination
    of publications used in implementation of systems. This document includes what
    is often referred to as \"cybersecurity\". This document excludes non-electrotechnical
    aspects of security such as societal security, except where they directly interact
    with electrotechnical security."
