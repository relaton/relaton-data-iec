abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003 defines a standard operating system interface
    and environment, including a command interpreter (or \"shell\"), and common utility
    programs to support applications portability at the source code level.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 9945-1:2003 is a minor revision and, together with ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003,
    ISO/IEC 9945-3:2003 and ISO/IEC 9945-4:2003, cancels and replaces ISO/IEC 9945-1:2002,
    ISO/IEC 9945-2:2002, ISO/IEC 9945-3:2002 and ISO/IEC 9945-4:2002.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003 is the single common revision to ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996
    (IEEE Std 1003.1-1996), ISO/IEC 9945-2:1993 (IEEE Std 1003.2-1992), and the Base
    Specifications of The Open Group Single UNIXÂ® Specification, Version 2. ISO/IEC
    9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003 is intended to be used by both applications developers
    and system implementors and comprises four major components (each in an associated
    volume).<br /><br />\r\nGeneral terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all
    volumes of ISO/IEC 9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003, including utility conventions and
    C-language header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume (ISO/IEC
    9945-1:2003).<br /><br />\r\nDefinitions for system service functions and subroutines,
    language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues,
    including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the
    System Interfaces volume (ISO/IEC 9945-2:2003).<br /><br />\r\nDefinitions for
    a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services (a \"shell\")
    and common utility programs for application programs are included in the Shell
    and Utilities volume (ISO/IEC 9945-3:2003).<br /><br />\r\nExtended rationale
    that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, containing historical
    information concerning the contents of ISO/IEC 9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003 and why
    features were included or discarded by the standard developers, is included in
    the Rationale (Informative) volume (ISO/IEC 9945-4:2003).<br /><br />\r\nThe following
    areas are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003:<br />\r\nGraphics
    interfaces<br />\r\nDatabase management system interfaces<br />\r\nRecord I/O
    considerations<br />\r\nObject or binary code portability<br />\r\nSystem configuration
    and resource availability<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 9945 (parts 1 to 4):2003 describes
    the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance to applications
    developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed to achieve
    these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and facilities
    that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications."
