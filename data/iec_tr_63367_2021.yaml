abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63367:2021 which is a technical report, summarises the results
    of a round robin on connector end face scratch recognition and verification by
    automated microscopes. The prime objectives of the study were:\r\n\r\n\tdetermine
    the amount of variability (repeatability and reproducibility) when different state-of-the-art
    inspection systems are assessed against IEC 61300-3-35:2015;\r\n\tevaluate any
    system-to-system variation in the quantity of reported scratches;\r\n\tprovide
    recommendations to improve the repeatability and reproducibility of fibre optic
    inspection systems."
