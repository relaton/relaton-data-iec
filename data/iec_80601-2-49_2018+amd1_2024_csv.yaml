abstract:
- content: IEC 80601-2-49:2018+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to basic safety and essential
    performance requirements of multifunction patient monitors, hereafter referred
    to as ME equipment or medical electrical systems. This particular standard applies
    to multifunction patient monitors intended for use in professional healthcare
    facilities as well as in the emergency medical service environment or the home
    healthcare environment. The scope of this document is restricted to ME equipment
    or medical electrical systems intended for connection to a single patient that
    has two or more physiological monitoring units. For purposes of this document,
    a pregnant mother and her fetus(es) are considered a single patient. This document
    does not specify requirements for individual physiological monitoring units such
    as ECG, invasive pressure and pulse oximetry. The particular standards related
    to these physiological monitoring units specify requirements from the perspective
    of stand-alone ME equipment. This particular standard addresses the additional
    requirements related to multifunction patient monitors. Multifunction patient
    monitors can be integrated into other ME equipment or medical electrical systems.
    When this is the case, other relevant standards also apply. This document does
    not apply to implantable parts of multifunction patient monitors. This first edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC 60601-2-49, published in 2011.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision to align with the current edition
    and Amendment to IEC 60601-1, new versions of collateral standards and amendments
    thereto. Major changes are in Clause 208 because many of the former requirements
    are now addressed by IEC 60601-1-8.
