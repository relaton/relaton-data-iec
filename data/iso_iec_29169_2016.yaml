abstract:
- content: '<p>ISO/IEC 29169:2016 aims to define the application of a conformity assessment
    methodology, based on the existing published ISO/IEC standards and guides, to
    the process assessment of process quality characteristics and organizational process
    maturity, performed in accordance with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 33001 to
    ISO/IEC 33099 family of process assessment standards,</p><p>Conformity assessment,
    also known as compliance assessment, is any activity to determine, directly or
    indirectly, that a process, product, or service meets relevant standards and fulfils
    relevant requirements. The subject of conformity assessment activities may include
    testing, inspection or certification.</p><p>Conformity assessment in this International
    Standard can be performed by various types of bodies that meet the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 17020.</p><p>The term "inspection" as used in ISO/IEC 17020 is synonymous
    with the term "process assessment" as defined in ISO/IEC 33001 and used throughout
    the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of standards.</p><p>While a process
    assessment may be performed solely according to the ISO/IEC 33002 requirements
    for performing an assessment, performing a process assessment in the context of
    conformity assessment according to a conformity assessment scheme brings with
    it additional requirements. Conformity assessment involves a functional approach
    consisting of a number of stages: selection?determination?review and attestation,
    plus surveillance when there is a need to provide continuing assurance of conformity.</p>'
