abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24789-1:2024 This document comprises a methodology for determining
    a test plan to simulate a card's service life. The methodology defines two parameters
    of card service life: the expected card service life in years and the average
    number of uses per day.<br />\r\nThis document and ISO/IEC 24789-2, together along
    with ISO/IEC 10373-1 describe the evaluation methods to be used and their criteria.<br
    />\r\nThis document was originally developed for ID-1 cards conforming to ISO/IEC
    7810 but can be useful in whole or in part for other types and form factors."
