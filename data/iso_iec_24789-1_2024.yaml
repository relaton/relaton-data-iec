abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document comprises a methodology for determining
    a test plan to simulate a card''s service life. The methodology defines two parameters
    of card service life: the expected card service life in years and the average
    number of uses per day.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document and ISO/IEC 24789-2,
    together along with ISO/IEC 10373-1 describe the evaluation methods to be used
    and their criteria.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document was originally developed
    for ID-1 cards conforming to ISO/IEC 7810 but can be useful in whole or in part
    for other types and form factors.</p>'
