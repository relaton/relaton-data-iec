abstract:
- content: "IEC 62341-6-7:2024 specifies the standard measuring conditions and measuring
    methods for determining the optical characteristics of an OLED display with under-screen
    camera; other under-screen features, such as under-screen fingerprint or under-screen
    time of flight (TOF) can also be applied. This document applies to OLED displays
    such as mobile phone, monitor and TV with under-screen features.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒUnder-screen
    feature will want the display to be partially transparent and partially non-transparent,
    and this can be achieved only by certain types of display technology, for example
    OLED. This document mainly focuses on OLED display with under-screen feature."
