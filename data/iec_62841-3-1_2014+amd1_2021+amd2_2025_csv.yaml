abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-3-1:2014+AMD1:2021+AMD2:2025 CSV applies to transportable table
    saws with:<br />\r\n- a toothed single blade; or<br />\r\n- stacked blades that
    cut a single groove or slot; or<br />\r\n- a moulding head cutter intended for
    cutting wood and analogous materials, plastics and nonferrous metals except magnesium
    with a saw blade diameter between 105 mm and 315 mm, which hereinafter may simply
    be referred to as saw or tool. The rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase
    a.c. or d.c. tools, and 480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The rated input is not
    more than 3 700 W. The limits for the applicability of this standard for battery
    tools is given in Annex K. This standard deals with the hazards presented by tools
    which are encountered by all persons in the normal use and reasonably foreseeable
    misuse of the tools. This standard does not apply to table saws intended to cut
    other metals, such as magnesium, steel and iron. This standard does not apply
    to table saws with an automatic feeding device.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to saws designed for use with abrasive wheels. This standard does not apply
    to table saws with more than one spindle such as for a scoring blade. The attention
    of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing
    organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new
    requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is
    the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted
    for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.
    The contents of the corrigendum of November 2015 have been included in this copy.<br
    />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62841-1:2014.<br
    />\r\nKey words: Table Saw, Transportable"
