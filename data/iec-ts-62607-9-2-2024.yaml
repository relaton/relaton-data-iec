  content: "IEC TS 62607-9-2:2024, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine the key control characteristic<br />\r\n• magnetic
    field distribution<br />\r\nof nanomagnetic materials, structures and devices
    by the<br />\r\n• magneto-optical indicator film technique.<br />\r\nThe magnetic
    field distribution is derived by utilizing a magneto optical indicator film, which
    is a thin film of magneto-optic material that is placed on the surface of an object
    exhibiting a spatially varying magnetic field distribution. The Faraday effect
    is then employed to measure the magnetic field strength by analysing the rotation
    of the polarization plane of light passing through the magneto-optic film.<br
    />\r\nThe method is applicable for measuring the stray field distribution of flat
    nanomagnetic materials, structures and devices.<br />\r\n- The method can especially
    be used to perform fast quantitative measurements of stray field distributions
    at the surface of an object.<br />\r\n- The magneto-optic indicator film technique
    (MOIF) is a fast, non-destructive method, making it an attractive option for materials
    analysis and testing in the industry.<br />\r\n- MOIF measurements can be done
    without any sample preparation and do not rely on specific surface properties
    of the object. It can be applied to the characterization of rough samples as well
    as of samples with non-magnetic cover layers.<br />\r\n- MOIF can quantitatively
    measure magnetic field distributions:<br />\r\n• with a one-shot measurement which
    typically takes a few seconds<br />\r\n• over areas of several square centimetres
    (over diameters of up to 15 cm with special techniques)<br />\r\n• in a field
    range from 1 mT to more than 100 mT<br />\r\n• with down to 1 µm spatial resolution<br
    />\r\n- Although techniques with nano-scale resolution are suitable for analysing
    the details of magnetic field structure, their ability to characterize larger
    areas is limited by their scanning area. Therefore, the MOIF technique is an indispensable
    complementary method that can offer a more comprehensive understanding of material
    properties.<br />\r\nThis document focuses on the calibration procedures, calibrated
    measurement process, and evaluation of measurement uncertainty to ensure the traceability
    of quantitative magnetic field measurements obtained through the magneto-optic
    indicator film technique."
