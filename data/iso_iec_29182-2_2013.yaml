abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 29182-2:2013 is intended to facilitate the development of
    International Standards in sensor networks. It presents terms and definitions
    for selected concepts relevant to the field of sensor networks. It establishes
    a general description of concepts in this field and identifies the relationships
    among those concepts. It may also be used as guidance for development of other
    parts of ISO&#x2F;IEC 29182 and any other sensor network related standard.
