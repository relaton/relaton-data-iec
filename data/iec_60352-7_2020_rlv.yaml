abstract:
- content: "IEC 60352-7:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60352-7:2020
    is applicable to spring clamp connections made with stripped wire without further
    preparation:<br />\r\n- solid conductors of 0,32 mm to 3,7 mm nominal diameter
    (0,08 mm2 to 10 mm2 crossâ€‘section), or<br />\r\n- stranded conductors of 0,08
    mm2 to 10 mm2 cross-section, or<br />\r\n- flexible conductors of 0,08 mm2 to
    10 mm2 cross-section,<br />\r\naccording to IEC 60228 or IEC 60189-3 for use in
    electrical and electronic equipment and components.<br />\r\nInformation on materials
    and data from industrial experience is included in addition to the test procedures
    to provide electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental conditions.
    The object of this document is to determine the suitability of spring clamp connections
    under specified mechanical, electrical and atmospheric conditions. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 60352-7, published in 2002.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    correction of the two flow charts in Figure 6 and Figure 7,<br />\r\nb) split
    the content into more clauses for better separation between full test schedule
    and basic test schedule,<br />\r\nc) relocating the content of former Clause 6
    Practical guidance into an informative Annex A, as now common in the IEC 60352
    series for solderless connections,<br />\r\nd) clarification on conductor types
    with reference to classes defined in IEC 60228."
