  content: "IEC 61196-8:2023 specifies the materials and cable construction for semi-flexible
    coaxial communication cables with fluoropolymer dielectric, IEC type designation,
    identification, marking and labelling, standard rating and characteristics, requirements
    of finished cables, quality assessment, delivery and storage, etc.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to semi-flexible coaxial communication cables with fluoropolymer
    dielectric and tin soaked copper wire braid outer conductor. These cables are
    intended for use in mobile communication base station antenna systems, terrestrial
    microwave communication, radar systems and wireless equipment or other signal
    transmission equipment or units. It is read in conjunction with IEC 61196-1:2005."
