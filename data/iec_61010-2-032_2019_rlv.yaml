abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-032:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61010-2-032:2019 specifies
    safety requirements for hand-held and hand-manipulated current sensors described
    below. These current sensors are for measuring, detecting or injecting current,
    or indicating current waveforms on circuits without physically opening the current
    path of the circuit being measured. They can be stand-alone current sensors or
    accessories to other equipment or parts of combined equipment (see Figure 101).
    These include measurement circuits which are part of electrical test and measurement
    equipment, laboratory equipment, or process control equipment. These current sensors
    and circuits need additional protective means between the current sensor, the
    circuit and an operator. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- It has been indicated that current sensors used as fixed equipment
    are not within the scope of this document.<br />\r\n- Fork-style current sensors
    have been added.<br />\r\n- Requirements from Part 2-033 applicable to clamp multimeters
    that have a primary purpose of measuring voltage on live mains have been included
    in the new normative Annex EE.<br />\r\n- Clearances and creepage distances for
    measuring circuit terminals exceeding 1 000 V a.c. or 1 414 V d.c. and for wet
    locations have been specified.<br />\r\n- Reduced creepage distances are allowed
    to be according to material group I for all insulating materials.<br />\r\n- Requirements
    for input/output circuits of Type A, Type B and Type C current sensors have been
    detailed in 6.9.102.<br />\r\n- Requirements for output circuit leads have been
    modified.<br />\r\n- The Jaw impact test has been limited to the front of the
    jaws.<br />\r\n- The abrasion test for cords of flexible current sensors has been
    removed and replaced by a pressure test at high temperature.<br />\r\n- The voltage
    source for testing overvoltage limiting components or circuits may be limited
    to 400 V.<br />\r\n- Reference to IEC 61010-031 for probe assemblies has been
    added.<br />\r\n- Requirements for the prevention of transient overvoltages for
    mains voltage measuring circuits have been added.<br />\r\n- Requirements for
    measuring circuits from 1 000 V to 3 000 V have been added.<br />\r\n- An informative
    Annex CC about the dimensions of banana terminals has been added.<br />\r\n- A
    flowchart for insulation according to the type of circuit has been added in a
    new Annex DD.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of February 2020 have been
    included in this copy.</p>"
