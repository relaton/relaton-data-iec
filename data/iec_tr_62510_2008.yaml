abstract:
- content: This technical report IEC/TR 62510:2008(E) outlines the way in which electricity
    is now described as a product. Particularly, in Europe and several other areas,
    for example Brazil and Argentina, as well as in some states in the United States
    of America. It is, however, rather a unique product because of its intangible
    and transient nature. Strictly, it is a product that exists only for an instant
    at a given point of delivery, comes into existence at the same instant at which
    it is being used and is replaced immediately by a new product with rather different
    characteristics. Its characteristics are different at each separate point of delivery.
    Moreover, it is a product whose quality depends not only on the elements that
    go into its production, but also in the way in which it is being used at any instant
    by the equipment of multiple users.
