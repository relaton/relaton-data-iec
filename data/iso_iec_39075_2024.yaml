abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 39075:2024 This document defines data structures and basic operations
    on property graphs. It provides capabilities for creating, accessing, querying,
    maintaining, and controlling property graphs and the data they comprise.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies the syntax and semantics of a data management language for
    specifying and modifying the structure of property graphs and collections thereof.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides a vehicle for portability of data definitions and
    manipulation among GQL-implementations. Implementations of this document can exist
    in environments that also support application programming languages, end-user
    query facilities, and various tools for database design, data administration,
    and performance optimization."
