abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11889 contains the definitions of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) commands.
    These commands make use of the constants, flags, structures, and union definitions
    defined in ISO/IEC 11889-2.<br />\r\nThe detailed description of the operation
    of the commands is written in the C language with extensive comments. The behavior
    of the C code in this ISO/IEC 11889-3:2015 is normative but does not fully describe
    the behavior of a TPM. The combination of this ISO/IEC 11889-3:2015 and ISO/IEC
    11889-4 is sufficient to fully describe the required behavior of a TPM.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11889-3:2015 and ISO/IEC 11889-4 is written to define the behavior of a compliant
    TPM. In some cases it is not possible to provide a compliant implementation. In
    those cases, any implementation provided by the vendor that meets the general
    description of the function provided in this part of ISO/IEC 11889 would be compliant."
