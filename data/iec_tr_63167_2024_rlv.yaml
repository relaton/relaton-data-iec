abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63167:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 63167:2024
    provides general information on the assessment of contact current related to human
    exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields. The contact currents
    in this context occur when a human body comes into contact with a conductive object
    that is non-electrified but exposed to an electric field or magnetic field or
    both at a different electric potential owing to electric or magnetic induction
    to the object. This is distinguished from the issue of electrical safety where
    contact with live parts of a conductive object is dealt with. In reference to
    the international EMF guidelines, the frequency range of contact current covered
    in this document is DC to 110 MHz, and only steady-state (continuous) contact
    currents are covered. Transient contact currents (spark discharges) which can
    occur immediately before the contact with the object are not covered."
