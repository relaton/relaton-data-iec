abstract:
- content: IEC TR 60825-17:2015(E) recommends safety measures to protect against effects
    caused exclusively by thermal, opto-mechanical and related effects in passive
    optical components and optical cables used in high power optical fibre communication
    systems. It does not apply to the use of high power optical systems in explosive
    atmospheres or the use of optical fibres in material processing machines. Throughout
    this part of IEC 60825, a reference to laser is taken to include light-emitting
    diodes (LEDs) and optical amplifiers. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
