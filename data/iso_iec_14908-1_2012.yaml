abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14908-1:2012 specifies a communication protocol for local area
    control networks. The protocol provides peer-to-peer communication for networked
    control and is suitable for implementing both peer-to-peer and master-slave control
    strategies. ISO/IEC 14908-1:2012 describes services in layers 2 to 7. In the layer
    2 (data link layer) specification, it also describes the Medium Access Control
    (MAC) sublayer interface to the physical layer. The physical layer provides a
    choice of transmission media. The interface described in ISO/IEC 14908-1:2012
    supports multiple transmission media at the physical layer. In the layer 7 specification,
    it includes a description of the types of messages used by applications to exchange
    application and network management data.
