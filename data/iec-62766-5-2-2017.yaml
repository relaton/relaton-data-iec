  content: IEC&nbsp;62766-5-2:2017(E) specifies a profile of HTML5, CSS and other
    related web technologies for connected TVs. Its goal is to describe a common profile
    that can be relied on by content and service providers and implemented by manufacturers.
    It does not describe extensions or modification to any of the referenced technologies
    but only tries to define a subset of web standards that are suitable and useful
    for TV deployments and at the same time stable enough to provide a good degree
    of confidence that real interoperability can be achieved. It may add clarifications
    and/or additional constraints where these are needed due to the nature of the
    target deployment environment.
