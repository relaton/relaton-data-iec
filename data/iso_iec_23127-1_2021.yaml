abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a metadata structure to store, present and exchange
    online learning facilitator (OLF) information by specifying the data elements
    and their attributes to describe facilitator’s information on various kinds of
    online education platforms.<br />\r\nThis document provides a generic information
    model of OLF to describe relevant information that applies to the facilitation
    and training services provided online, and includes information about the person
    offering facilitation, the affiliation of the person, facilitation ability, facilitation
    practices, the facilitation service offered, learners’ reviews and testimonies,
    and related social network information. The conceptual data model allows the linguistic
    diversity of OLF information attributes and offers a flexible metadata schema
    to describe them.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Although this document provides suggestions
    on how to designate metadata elements that require privacy protection, it does
    not provide detailed methods or techniques for how to implement privacy protection
    measures.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 For metadata with privacy, the application profile in
    ISO/IEC 19788-1 can be used to tag data elements concerning privacy and define
    them with conditions. OLF information privacy protection methods and techniques,
    such as privacy-by-design, can be selected and applied as needed by implementers."
