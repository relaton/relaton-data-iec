abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24730-2 is comprised of a main document and two additional parts,
    ISO/IEC 24730-21 and ISO/IEC 24730-22, and defines a networked location system
    that provides X-Y coordinates and data telemetry. The system utilizes real-time
    locating systems (RTLS) transmitters that autonomously generate a direct sequence
    spread spectrum radio frequency beacon. These devices can be field programmable
    and support an optional exciter mode that allows modification of the rate of location
    update and location of the RTLS device. ISO/IEC 24730-2 defines these modes, but
    does not define the means by which they are accomplished. ISO/IEC 24730-21:2012
    specifies transmitters operating with a single spread code and employing a differential
    binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) data encoding and binary phase shift keying
    (BPSK) spreading scheme.
