abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62039:2021(E) presents the important material properties of polymeric
    materials used in outdoor insulation and, where applicable, lists standardized
    test methods including minimum requirements. If no standardized tests are available,
    the test methods reported in literature are summarized.<br />\r\nThis document
    is valid for insulating materials having polymeric insulation, which are used
    in outdoor high voltage electrical applications with a system voltage greater
    than 1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC (several tests are only defined for alternating
    current, which are not applicable for direct current). Such applications are relevant
    where the housing is an integral part of the device, for example in surge arresters
    and cable terminations. The scope of this document is limited to the insulation
    materials only and is not generally intended for coating materials (coating materials
    are, for example, thin layers applied on toughened glass and ceramic). Some tests
    mentioned in this document are applicable for coating and are under consideration
    by CIGRE. The performance of insulators in service depends on several factors
    such as the type of material, the design and environmental conditions. Consequently,
    the choice of materials that fulfil the requirements listed in Table 1 is a necessary
    condition but does not guarantee satisfactory performance when used in outdoor
    insulation."
