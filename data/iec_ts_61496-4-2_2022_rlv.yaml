abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61496-4-2:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 61496-4-2:2022
    specifies requirements for the design, construction and testing of non-contact
    electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed specifically to detect
    persons as part of a safety-related system, employing vision-based protective
    devices (VBPDs) using reference pattern techniques (VBPDPP) for the sensing function.
    Special attention is directed to features which ensure that an appropriate safety-related
    performance is achieved. An ESPE can include optional safety-related functions,
    the requirements for which are given in Annex A of IEC 61496-1:2020 and this document.
    Where this document does not contain all necessary provisions, then IEC TS 62998-1
    applies. It is also possible, for those aspects not considered in this document,
    to use provisions from IEC TS 62998-1 additionally. This document does not specify
    the dimensions or configurations of the detection zone and its disposition in
    relation to hazardous parts for any particular application, nor what constitutes
    a hazardous state of any machine. It is restricted to the functioning of the ESPE
    and how it interfaces with the machine. A VBPDPP is defined as consisting of a
    single image-sensing device viewing on a passive reference pattern as the background
    and where the detection principle is based on blocking or partially preventing
    the view of the pattern. Information about the thickness, shape, surface characteristics
    or location of the object is not required for detection. For multi-image sensing
    devices, additional techniques, requirements and test procedures can be necessary.<br
    />\r\n- This document is limited to automatic vision-based ESPEs that do not require
    human intervention for detection.<br />\r\n- It is limited to automatic vision-based
    ESPEs that detect objects entering into, or are present in, a detection zone(s).<br
    />\r\n- It is limited to ESPEs using active illumination technique.<br />\r\n-
    Excluded from this technical specification are VBPDPPs employing radiation at
    wavelengths outside the range 400 nm to 1 500 nm.<br />\r\n- This document does
    not address those aspects required for complex classification or differentiation
    of the object detected.<br />\r\nThis document is relevant for VBPDPPs having
    a stated detection capability up to 200 mm. This document does not deal with EMC
    emission requirements.<br />\r\nIEC TS 61496-4-2:2022 cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Some requirement clauses and test procedures have been adapted
    or removed because they have been consolidated in IEC 61496-1:2020 (e.g. 5.4.6.2
    of IEC 61496-1:2020 Light sources or Clause A.9)."
