abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies tweakable block ciphers. A tweakable block
    cipher is a family of<em>n</em>-bit permutations parametrized by a secret key
    value and a public tweak value. Such primitives are generic tools that can be
    used as building blocks to construct cryptographic schemes such as encryption,
    Message Authentication Codes, authenticated encryption, etc.</p><p>A total of
    five different tweakable block ciphers are defined. They are categorized in Table
    1.</p>"
