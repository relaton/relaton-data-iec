abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18033-7:2022 This document specifies tweakable block ciphers.
    A tweakable block cipher is a family of n-bit permutations parametrized by a secret
    key value and a public tweak value. Such primitives are generic tools that can
    be used as building blocks to construct cryptographic schemes such as encryption,
    Message Authentication Codes, authenticated encryption, etc.<br />\r\nA total
    of five different tweakable block ciphers are defined. They are categorized in
    Table 1."
