abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62997:2017(E) specifies the characteristics of external magnetic
    nearfields, computations of and requirements on induced electric fields in body
    tissues in the frequency range from 1 Hz to 6 MHz with respect to induced electric
    shock phenomena, for electroheating (EH) based treatment technologies and for
    electromagnetic processing of materials (EPM). The phenomena include specific
    absorption rates with time integration.
