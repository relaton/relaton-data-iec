abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-9-6:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62257-9-6:2019
    proposes a simple selection procedure and cheap, comparative tests which can be
    performed in laboratories of developing countries, in order to identify the most
    suitable model of small Photovoltaic Individual Electrification Systems (PV- IES)
    up to 500 Wp for a particular rural electrification project from a number of products
    submitted for test. The tests provided in IEC TS 62257-9-6 allow assessment of
    the performance of a PV-IES according to the requirement of the general specification
    of the project (see IEC/TS 62257-2) and to verify their ability to provide the
    required service. This second edition of IEC TS 62257-9-6 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2008. The main technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- Removal of the term \"small\"
    from the title of the publication and from description of rural electrification
    systems.<br />\r\n- Removal of the limits on system voltage and power; these recommendations
    apply to systems of all sizes."
