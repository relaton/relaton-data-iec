abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 61850-90-7:2013(E) describes the functions for power converter-based
    distributed energy resources (DER) systems, focused on DC-to-AC and AC-to-AC conversions
    and including photovoltaic systems (PV), battery storage systems, electric vehicle
    (EV) charging systems, and any other DER systems with a controllable power converter.
    It defines the IEC 61850 information models to be used in the exchange of information
    between these power converter-based DER systems and the utilities, energy service
    providers (ESPs), or other entities which are tasked with managing the volt, var,
    and watt capabilities of these power converter-based systems. These power converter-based
    DER systems can range from very small grid-connected systems at residential customer
    sites, to medium-sized systems configured as microgrids on campuses or communities,
    to very large systems in utility-operated power plants, and to many other configurations
    and ownership models.
