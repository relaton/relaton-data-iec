  content: "IEC TR 63436:2026 explains the setting parameters of insulation monitoring
    devices (IMDs) and how to interpret these measurements through plotted curves.
    Some examples of injection methods are also proposed.<br />\r\nThe examples given
    in this document consider the situation of an insulation fault in an installation
    or equipment (motors, enclosure, cables, etc.) creating a resistive path to earth
    and calculate the touch voltage. It does not consider a person making direct contact
    with a live conductor in an IT grid."
