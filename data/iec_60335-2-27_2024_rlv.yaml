abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-27:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-27:2024
    deals with the safety of electrical appliances incorporating emitters for exposing
    the skin to optical radiation (wavelength 100 nm to 1 mm), for household and similar
    use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances. As far as practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    using the appliances in tanning salons, beauty parlours and similar premises or
    at home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons
    (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of
    experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without
    supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to<br />\r\n- appliances for skin or hair care (IEC 60335-2-23);<br />\r\n-
    sauna heating appliances and infrared cabins (IEC 60335-2-53);<br />\r\n- cosmetic
    and beauty care appliances incorporating lasers and intense light sources (IEC
    60335-2-113);<br />\r\n- appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);<br />\r\n-
    appliances that use UV radiation for purposes other than tanning the skin;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in
    2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) modification or conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1);<br />\r\nc) clarification of
    product risk and liability (7.1);<br />\r\nd) modification of Annex DD as a normative
    annex, and modification of relevant text (7.12, Annex DD);<br />\r\ne) clarification
    of requirement for product use links provided (7.12.9);<br />\r\nf) clarification
    of the application of test probe 18 for appliances for use in tanning salons,
    beauty parlours and similar premises (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\ng) introduction of
    accessible surface temperature limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nh) removal of redundancy
    between 22.113 and 22.114;<br />\r\ni) clarification that 32.2 is not applicable
    for UV emitted for the tanning function of the appliance.<br />\r\nThis part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
