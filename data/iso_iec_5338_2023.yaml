abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines a set of processes and associated
    concepts for describing the life cycle of AI systems based on machine learning
    and heuristic systems. It is based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207
    with modifications and additions of AI-specific processes from ISO/IEC 22989 and
    ISO/IEC 23053.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides processes that
    support the definition, control, management, execution and improvement of the
    AI system in its life cycle stages. These processes can also be used within an
    organization or a project when developing or acquiring AI systems. When an element
    of an AI system is traditional software or a traditional system, the software
    life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and the system life cycle processes
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 can be used to implement that element.</p>
