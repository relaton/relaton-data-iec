abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 5338:2024 This document defines a set of processes and associated
    concepts for describing the life cycle of AI systems based on machine learning
    and heuristic systems. It is based on ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207
    with modifications and additions of AI-specific processes from ISO/IEC 22989 and
    ISO/IEC 23053.<br />\r\nThis document provides processes that support the definition,
    control, management, execution and improvement of the AI system in its life cycle
    stages. These processes can also be used within an organization or a project when
    developing or acquiring AI systems. When an element of an AI system is traditional
    software or a traditional system, the software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 and the system life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 can be used to
    implement that element."
