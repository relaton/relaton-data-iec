abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63377:2022 describes assessment methods to evaluate the compliance
    of radiative wireless power transfer (WPT) systems operating in the frequency
    range from 30 MHz to 300 GHz with electromagnetic guidelines on human exposure
    (electromagnetic field strength, specific absorption rate (SAR), and power density).
    This document includes but is not limited to systems that focus the electromagnetic
    energy emitted by the transmitter to regions surrounding the receiver, for example,
    by narrow beam-forming systems, wide-beam systems and spatially closed systems.
    Implementations without transmitter, for example, applications that harvest energy
    from the environment, are not included in the scope of this document.
