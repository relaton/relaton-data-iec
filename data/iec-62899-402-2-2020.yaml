  content: "IEC 62899-402-2:2020(E) describes the measurement methods of the edge
    waviness of printed patterns in printed electronics.<br />\r\nThis document includes
    the measurement procedure, as well as the definition of edge waviness and related
    attributes such as average edge, touch edge and distribution edge of edge waviness,
    which are quite different from those that appear in the printing of graphic arts
    or from etching processes."
