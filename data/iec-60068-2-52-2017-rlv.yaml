  content: "IEC 60068-2-52:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60068-2-52:2017
    specifies the application of the cyclic salt mist test to components or equipment
    designed to withstand a salt-laden atmosphere as salt can degrade the performance
    of parts manufactured using metallic and/or non-metallic materials. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 1996. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the entire
    content has been harmonized with ISO 9227 as far as possible;<br />\r\n- an introduction
    has been added;<br />\r\n- the scope has been simplified;<br />\r\n- normative
    references have been updated;<br />\r\n- the general description of the test has
    been changed;<br />\r\n- a dry chamber has been added to the test apparatus;<br
    />\r\n- severities have been changed to test methods;<br />\r\n- test methods
    7 and 8 have been added;<br />\r\n- information on the test report has been added;<br
    />\r\n- Figure 1 has been changed to Table 1;<br />\r\n- a typical test apparatus
    example has been added in a new Annex A;<br />\r\n- a description of each test
    method has been added in a new Annex B;<br />\r\n- bibliographical references
    have been added."
