  content: "IEC 61196-9-1:2023 applies to coaxial communication cables described in
    IEC 61196-9. It specifies the requirements of flexible coaxial communication cables
    with solid or semi-air-spaced dielectric and wrap or/and braid outer conductor.
    These cables are widely used in mobile communication systems, microwave test equipment,
    consumer electronics and other fields.<br />\r\nThis document determines the layout
    and style for detail specifications. Detail specifications (DS) can be prepared
    by a national organization, a manufacturer or a user by entering the details in
    the blank detail specification."
