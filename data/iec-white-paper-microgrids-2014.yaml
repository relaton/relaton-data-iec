  content: "While they are often seen as a means of encouraging the take up of renewable
    energy and addressing challenges of peak demand, microgrids can make a significant
    contribution to disaster preparedness and recovery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White
    Paper considers preparation for and recovery from major electricity outages, with
    a focus on customer-side measures. It examines how disaster preparedness and post
    disaster recovery may benefit from Standards and the design of plans for coordinated
    activity.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMicrogrids are a solution to many of the issues identified
    in the disaster review. By relying on a variety of generators, a microgrid system
    avoids many of the single-point-of failure issues of the traditional electricity
    grid. Key suggestions encourage the operation of microgrids and the implementation
    of standards to assist disaster relief planning. Business and electricity continuity
    planning as well as electricity continuity systems are examined as solutions for
    disaster preparedness and recovery.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe development of this
    White Paper was led by the <a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">IEC MSB</a> (Market
    Strategy Board) project team on microgrid disaster preparedness and recovery in
    cooperation with CSIRO (the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation)
    of Australia and AIST (the Japanese National Institute of Advanced Industrial
    Science and Technology).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available
    for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/microgrids-disaster-preparedness-and-recovery-electricity-continuity-plans-and-systems\">free
    download</a>."
