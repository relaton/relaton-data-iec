  content: "IEC 60601-2-21:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-21:2020
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of INFANT RADIANT WARMERS
    as defined in 201.3.204, also referred to as ME EQUIPMENT. If a clause or subclause
    is specifically intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT only, or to ME SYSTEMS
    only, the title and content of that clause or subclause will say so. If that is
    not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS,
    as relevant. HAZARDS inherent in the intended physiological function of ME EQUIPMENT
    or ME SYSTEMS within the scope of this document are not covered by specific requirements
    in this document, except in 7.2.13 and 8.4.1 of the general standard. IEC 60601-2-21:2020
    specifies the safety requirements for INFANT RADIANT WARMERS, but alternate methods
    of compliance with a specific clause, by demonstrating equivalent safety, will
    not be judged as non-compliant, if the MANUFACTURER has demonstrated in his RISK
    MANAGEMENT FILE that the RISK presented by the HAZARD has been found to be of
    an acceptable level when weighed against the benefit of treatment from the device.<br
    />\r\nThis particular standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- devices supplying
    heat via BLANKETS, PADS or MATTRESSES in medical use; for information, see IEC
    60601-2-35;<br />\r\n- INFANT INCUBATORS; for information, see IEC 60601-2-19;<br
    />\r\n- INFANT TRANSPORT INCUBATORS, for information, see IEC 60601-2-20;<br />\r\n-
    INFANT PHOTOTHERAPY EQUIPMENT, for information, see IEC 60601-2-50.<br />\r\nSKIN
    TEMPERATURE SENSORS which are applied to operate a BABY CONTROLLED RADIANT WARMER
    including the displayed value are not considered to be a CLINICAL THERMOMETER
    in the sense of the particular standard ISO 80601-2-56. IEC 60601-2-21:2020 cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2009 and Amendment 1:2016. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. IEC 60601-2-21:2020 includes the following significant
    technical change with respect to the previous edition: alignment with IEC 60601-1:2005
    and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012."
