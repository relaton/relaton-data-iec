abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61292-12:2022 which is a Technical Report, provides general information
    on optical fibre amplifiers for space division multiplexed transmission systems
    using multi-core, few-mode, and multi-core and few-mode optical fibres. This document
    describes the classification, concepts, configurations, and implementations of
    these amplifiers as well as state-of-the-art development technologies, specific
    features and measurement methods.
