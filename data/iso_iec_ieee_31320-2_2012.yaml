abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 31320-2:2012 describes the semantics and syntax of IDEF1X,
    a language used to represent a conceptual schema. Two styles of IDEF1X model are
    described.<br /><br />\r\nThe key style is used to produce information models
    that represent the structure and semantics of data within an enterprise and is
    backward-compatible with the US government's Federal Information Processing Standard
    (FIPS) PUB 184, Integration Definition for Information Modeling (IDEF1X).<br />\r\nThe
    identity style is used to produce object models that represent the knowledge,
    behaviour, and rules of the concepts within an enterprise. It can be used as a
    growth path for key-style models. The identity style can, with suitable automation
    support, be used to develop a model that is an executable prototype of the target
    object-oriented system."
