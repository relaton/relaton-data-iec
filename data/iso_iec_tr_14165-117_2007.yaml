abstract:
- content: Fibre channel is a high speed serial interface using either optical or
    electrical connections and provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper
    Level Protocols (ULPs). This Technical Report provides measurement methods and
    specifications to be used as part of a total signal performance compliance requirement
    set where the phase content of the signal is involved. A more generalized concept
    for jitter compliance testing is developed where the phase properties of the signals
    at signal levels other than the nominal receiver switching point are considered
    as well as the phase properties at the nominal receiver detection threshold.
