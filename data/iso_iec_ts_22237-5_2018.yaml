abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC TS 22237-5:2018 addresses the wide range of telecommunications
    cabling infrastructures within data centres based upon the criteria and classifications
    for "availability" within ISO/IEC TS 22237â€‘1.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 22237-5:2018 specifies
    requirements and recommendations for the following:</p><p>a) information technology
    and network telecommunications cabling (e.g. SAN and LAN);</p><p>b) general information
    technology cabling to support the operation of the data centre;</p><p>c) telecommunications
    cabling to monitor and control, as appropriate, power distribution, environmental
    control and physical security of the data centre;</p><p>d) other building automation
    cabling;</p><p>e) pathways, spaces and enclosures for the telecommunications cabling
    infrastructures.</p><p>Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements
    are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and
    regulations. However, information given in this document may be of assistance
