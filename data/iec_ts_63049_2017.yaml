abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63049:2017(E) provides the minimum activities deemed necessary to
    implement an effective quality assurance program for the managing and reducing
    of risk in the installation and operation of photovoltaic (PV) systems. This document
    defines requirements for certifying that an entity has and uses a quality assurance
    program to prevent, or reduce errors and learns from any new errors in installation,
    operation and maintenance of a PV system. The object of this document is to provide
    more confidence in the performance and reliability of certified PV systems. By
    being installed and operated under a Quality Assurance program in accordance with
    this document, PV systems are expected to operate as designed and as expected
    based on product warranties.
