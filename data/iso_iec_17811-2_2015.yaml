    ISO/IEC 17811-2:2015 provides the specification of Device Control and Management Protocol (DCMP), which is an application-layer protocol used to control and manage the various devices. DCMP supports the device and network status information retrieval, device initialization, firmware and software update, file transmission, and so on. This part of ISO/IEC 17811 specifies the protocol operations and message structure of DCMP.

    The network security is out of scope in this part of ISO/IEC 17811. However, the security services can be necessary according to applications of DCMP. DCMP can suffer from many network specific threats. To countermeasure those threats, some security mechanism can be deployed.
