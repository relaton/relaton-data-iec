abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document identifies the reference
    framework for the benchmarking of vision-based spatial registration and tracking
    (vSRT) methods for mixed and augmented reality (MAR).</p><p>The framework provides
    typical benchmarking processes, benchmark indicators and trial set elements that
    are necessary to successfully identify, define, design, select and apply benchmarking
    of vSRT methods for MAR. It also provides definitions for terms on benchmarking
    of vSRT methods for MAR.</p><p>In addition, this document provides a conformance
    checklist as a tool to clarify how each benchmarking activity conforms to this
    document in a compact form by declaring which benchmarking processes and benchmark
    indicators are included and what types of trial sets are used in each benchmarking
    activity.</p>
