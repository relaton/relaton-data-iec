abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18520:2019 This document identifies the reference framework for
    the benchmarking of vision-based spatial registration and tracking (vSRT) methods
    for mixed and augmented reality (MAR).<br />\r\nThe framework provides typical
    benchmarking processes, benchmark indicators and trial set elements that are necessary
    to successfully identify, define, design, select and apply benchmarking of vSRT
    methods for MAR. It also provides definitions for terms on benchmarking of vSRT
    methods for MAR.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document provides a conformance checklist
    as a tool to clarify how each benchmarking activity conforms to this document
    in a compact form by declaring which benchmarking processes and benchmark indicators
    are included and what types of trial sets are used in each benchmarking activity."
