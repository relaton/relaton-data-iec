  content: "<div>IEC 62357-2:2019 (E), which is a technical report, establishes the
    list of Use Cases developed by TC 57, Power systems management and associated
    information exchanges, in order to prepare International Standards, Technical
    Reports and Technical Specifications. Use Cases are fundamental to TC 57 publications</div>\r\n\r\n<div>This
    Technical Report:<br />\r\n• Identifies in existing standards, technical specification,
    reports and in ongoing TC 57 work (CD, DTS, DTR etc.) the Use Cases used as well
    as their links to standards, their status as Use Cases (level of description,
    standardization of the description referring to IEC 62559) and as IEC deliverables
    (are they in a TR/TS/IS, what is the status of the document CD, CDV etc.)<br />\r\n•
    Helps System Committees consolidate Use Cases through terminology and term definition
    work (link with existing relevant standards on the TC Terminology) and building
    links between roles and modelling frameworks (Role models). For example in TC
    57 building links between the Use Case methodology and the roles used in IEC 62913-2
    with CIM Interface Reference Model (IRM – IEC 61968).<br />\r\n• Shares and promotes
    those Use Cases within TC 57 and outside it. TC 57 mainly describes System Use
    Cases in the standards it publishes. Business roles and business Use Cases are
    mainly described within SyC SE (System Committee Smart Energy) deliverables (IEC
    62559 series and IEC 62913 series).<br />\r\n• This document provides good input
    in reusing System Use Cases and System Roles inside and outside TC 57.<br />\r\n•
    Explains the content of its Use Cases to potential users and providing support
    on using those Use Cases for standardization (Normative context, maturity of the
    Use Case, location in standardization work, roles implied)<br />\r\nThose Use
    Cases aimed to be used as tools to identify requirements as input to further development
    of technical standards (whether TC 57 or not) and improve the consistency in this
    work and in that way contribute to interoperability. Use Cases facilitate cooperation
    at a system level with TCs, other standards-developing organizations, non-traditional
    players of electrotechnology, and regional organizations. Inside the IEC they
    provide a convergence platform with overall system level value for support of
    the Technical Committees and other standard development groups.<br />\r\nThis
    document allows TC 57 to self-assess its work on Use Cases through KPIs (Key Performance
    Indicator) such as:<br />\r\n• % of Use Cases compliant with IEC 62559-2<br />\r\n•
    % of Business Use Cases (BUC) and System Use Cases (SUC)<br />\r\n• % of Business
    Roles and System Roles</div>"
