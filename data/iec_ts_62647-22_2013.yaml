abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62647-22:2013(E) is intended for use as technical guidance by aerospace,
    defence, and high performance (ADHP) electronic applications and systems suppliers,
    e.g., original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and system maintenance facilities,
    in developing and implementing designs and processes to ensure the continued performance,
    quality, reliability, safety, airworthiness, configuration control, affordability,
    maintainability, and supportability of high performance aerospace systems both
    during and after the transition to Pb-free electronics. The guidelines may be
    used by the OEMs and maintenance facilities to implement the methodologies they
    use to ensure the performance, reliability, airworthiness, safety, and certifiability
    of their products, in accordance with IEC/TS 62647-1:2012. This document also
    contains lessons learned from previous experience with Pb-free aerospace electronic
    systems.
