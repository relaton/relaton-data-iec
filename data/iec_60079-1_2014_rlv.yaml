abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-1:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-1:2014 contains
    specific requirements for the construction and testing of electrical equipment
    with the type of protection flameproof enclosure \"d\", intended for use in explosive
    gas atmospheres. This standard supplements and modifies the general requirements
    of IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement of this standard conflicts with a requirement
    of IEC 60079-0, the requirement of this standard will take precedence. This seventh
    edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition, published in 2007, and constitutes
    a technical revision. The numerous changes are identified in the Foreward of the
    document. Keywords: flameproof enclosure \"d\", explosive gas atmospheres<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of June 2018 and Interpretation sheet of May 2020
    have been included in this copy."
