abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 62582-1:2024
    contains requirements for application of the other parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 related
    to specific methods for condition monitoring in electrical equipment important
    to safety of nuclear power plants. It also includes requirements which are common
    to all methods. The procedures defined in IEC/IEEE 62582 are intended for detailed
    condition monitoring.<br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 62582 specifies condition monitoring methods
    in sufficient detail to enhance the accuracy and repeatability, and provide standard
    formats for reporting the results. The methods specified are applicable to electrical
    equipment containing polymeric materials. Some methods are especially designed
    for the measurement of condition of a limited range of equipment whilst others
    can be applied to all types of equipment for which the polymeric parts are accessible."
