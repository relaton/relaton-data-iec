  content: "IEC 60335-2-7:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-7:2019
    deals with the safety of electric washing machines for household and similar use,
    that are intended for washing clothes and textiles, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.
    This standard also deals with the safety of electric washing machines for household
    and similar use employing an electrolyte instead of detergent. Additional requirements
    for these appliances are given in Annex CC. Guidance is given in Annex DD for
    requirements that can be used to ensure an acceptable level of protection against
    electrical and thermal hazards for washing machines fitted with a power driven
    wringer. Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this
    standard.<br />\r\nExamples of such appliances are washing machines for communal
    use in blocks of flats or in launderettes. As far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by washing machines that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for
    washing machines intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements may be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n–
    washing machines intended exclusively for industrial purposes (ISO 10472-2);<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– washing machines incorporating steam generating devices in which steam
    is produced at a pressure exceeding 50 kPa.<br />\r\nThis eighth edition cancels
    and replaces the seventh edition published in 2008, Amendment 1: 2011 and Amendment
    2:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n– requirements for steam generators in 3.1.9, 3.6.101, 19.101, 22.106, 22.107;<br
    />\r\n– additional definitions for washing machine types in 3.5.101,3.5.102, 3.5.103;<br
    />\r\n– revised temperature limits for external accessible surfaces in 11.3 and
    11.8;<br />\r\n– revised test procedure for the spillage test in 15.2;<br />\r\n–
    additional requirements for appliances that are controlled by programmable electronic
    circuits that limit the number of heating elements and motors from being energised
    at the same time, Subclause 22.108.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established
    on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
