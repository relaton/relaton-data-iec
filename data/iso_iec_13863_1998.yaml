abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the Path Replacement additional network feature (ANF-PR), which is applicable
    to</p><p>various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks
    (PISN). Basic services are specified in</p><p>ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>ANF-PR is a
    feature which applies to an established call, allowing that call's connection
    between Private Integrated Services</p><p>Network Exchanges (PINXs) to be replaced
    by a new connection. If the new connection is required to satisfy certain criteria,</p><p>ANF-PR
    should be used in conjunction with other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Annex
    A gives examples of the</p><p>circumstances under which ANF-PR can be used and
    criteria which can govern the selection of the new connection.</p><p>Additional
    network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the
    method described in CCITT</p><p>Recommendation I.130 for supplementary services.
    This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications</p><p>of
    ANF-PR. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the feature as seen by
    an entity which initiates path replacement, the</p><p>ANF-PR user. The stage 2
    specification (clauses 7, 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved
    in the feature and the</p><p>information flows between them. Clause 7 contains
    the stage 2 specification for basic operation of the feature. Clause 8</p><p>contains
    the stage 2 specification for an enhanced mode of working which can be employed
    when supported by all the</p><p>equipment involved. It allows some of the elements
    of the old connection to be re-used. Clause 9 contains the stage 2</p><p>specification
    for an optional enhancement of the basic operation of the feature. It allows the
    ANF-PR user to be located in any</p><p>PINX in the old connection and to decide
    the direction of the new connection.</p>
