abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the Path Replacement additional network feature
    (ANF-PR), which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nANF-PR
    is a feature which applies to an established call, allowing that call's connection
    between Private Integrated Services<br />\r\nNetwork Exchanges (PINXs) to be replaced
    by a new connection. If the new connection is required to satisfy certain criteria,<br
    />\r\nANF-PR should be used in conjunction with other supplementary services and/or
    ANFs. Annex A gives examples of the circumstances under which ANF-PR can be used
    and criteria which can govern the selection of the new connection.<br />\r\nAdditional
    network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the
    method described in CCITT Recommendation I.130 for supplementary services. This
    International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-PR.
    The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the feature as seen by an entity
    which initiates path replacement, the ANF-PR user. The stage 2 specification (clauses
    7, 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the feature and the
    information flows between them. Clause 7 contains the stage 2 specification for
    basic operation of the feature. Clause 8 contains the stage 2 specification for
    an enhanced mode of working which can be employed when supported by all the equipment
    involved. It allows some of the elements of the old connection to be re-used.
    Clause 9 contains the stage 2 specification for an optional enhancement of the
    basic operation of the feature. It allows the ANF-PR user to be located in any
    PINX in the old connection and to decide the direction of the new connection."
