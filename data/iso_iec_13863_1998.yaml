abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Path Replacement additional
    network feature (ANF-PR), which is applicable to</p><p>various basic services
    supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified
    in</p><p>ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>ANF-PR is a feature which applies to an established
    call, allowing that call's connection between Private Integrated Services</p><p>Network
    Exchanges (PINXs) to be replaced by a new connection. If the new connection is
    required to satisfy certain criteria,</p><p>ANF-PR should be used in conjunction
    with other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Annex A gives examples of the</p><p>circumstances
    under which ANF-PR can be used and criteria which can govern the selection of
    the new connection.</p><p>Additional network feature specifications are produced
    in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT</p><p>Recommendation
    I.130 for supplementary services. This International Standard contains the stage
    1 and stage 2 specifications</p><p>of ANF-PR. The stage 1 specification (clause
    6) specifies the feature as seen by an entity which initiates path replacement,
    the</p><p>ANF-PR user. The stage 2 specification (clauses 7, 8 and 9) identifies
    the functional entities involved in the feature and the</p><p>information flows
    between them. Clause 7 contains the stage 2 specification for basic operation
    of the feature. Clause 8</p><p>contains the stage 2 specification for an enhanced
    mode of working which can be employed when supported by all the</p><p>equipment
    involved. It allows some of the elements of the old connection to be re-used.
    Clause 9 contains the stage 2</p><p>specification for an optional enhancement
    of the basic operation of the feature. It allows the ANF-PR user to be located
    in any</p><p>PINX in the old connection and to decide the direction of the new
    connection.</p>"
