  content: "IEC TS 61934:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TS 61934:2024
    is applicable to the off-line electrical measurement of partial discharges (PDs)
    that occur in electrical insulation systems (EISs) when stressed by repetitive
    voltage impulses generated from power electronics devices.<br />\r\nTypical applications
    are EISs belonging to apparatus driven by power electronics, such as motors, inductive
    reactors, wind turbine generators and the power electronics modules themselves.<br
    />\r\nNOTE Use of this document with specific products can require the application
    of additional procedures.<br />\r\nExcluded from the scope of this document are:<br
    />\r\n- methods based on optical or ultrasonic PD detection,<br />\r\n- fields
    of application for PD measurements when stressed by non-repetitive impulse voltages
    such as lightning impulse or switching impulses from switchgear.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) background information on the progress being made
    in the field of power electronics including the introduction of wide band gap
    semiconductor devices has been added to the Introduction;<br />\r\nb) voltage
    impulse generators; the parameter values of the voltage impulse waveform have
    been modified to reflect application of wide band gap semiconductor devices.<br
    />\r\nc) PD detection methods; charge-based measurements are not described in
    this third edition nor are source-controlled gating techniques to suppress external
    noise.<br />\r\nd) Since the previous edition in 2011, there have been significant
    technical advances in this field as evidenced by several hundreds of publications.
    Consequently, the Bibliography in the 2011 edition has been deleted in this third
    edition."
