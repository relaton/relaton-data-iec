abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI/IEEE 802.2 and others. This
    International Standard describes the physical interface portions of a high performance
    serial link that supports the higher Upper Level Protocols (ULPs) associated with
    HIPPI, IPI, SCSI, IP and others.
