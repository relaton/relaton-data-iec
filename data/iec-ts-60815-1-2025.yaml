  content: "IEC TS 60815-1:2025 is applicable to the selection of insulators, and
    the determination of their relevant dimensions, to be used in outdoor high-voltage
    systems with respect to pollution. For the purposes of this technical specification
    series, the insulators are divided into the following broad categories, each dealt
    with in a specific part as follows:<br />\r\n- IEC TS 60815-2 – Ceramic and glass
    insulators for AC systems;<br />\r\n- IEC TS 60815-3 – Polymer insulators for
    AC systems;<br />\r\n- IEC TS 60815-4 – Insulators for DC systems.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides general definitions, gives methods for the evaluation of site
    pollution severity (SPS) and outlines the principles to arrive at an informed
    judgement on the probable behaviour of a given insulator in certain pollution
    environments. The general principles described are applicable to both AC and DC
    systems. However, the applicability part mainly refers to AC. More information
    about DC can be found in IEC TS 60815-4.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to all types of external insulation, including insulation forming part of other
    apparatus. The term \"insulator\" is used hereafter to refer to any type of insulator.<br
    />\r\nThe objective of this technical specification series is to:<br />\r\n- understand
    and identify parameters of the system, application, equipment and site influencing
    the pollution behaviour of insulators,<br />\r\n- understand and choose the appropriate
    approach to the design and selection of the insulator solution, based on available
    data, time and resources.<br />\r\n- characterise the type of pollution at a site
    and determine the site pollution severity (SPS) value and the SPS class,<br />\r\n-
    determine the reference unified specific creepage distance (RUSCD) of \"reference\"
    insulator based on the SPS class,<br />\r\n- select candidate insulators and determine
    corrections to apply to RUSCD to arrive at the USCD of the \"candidate\" insulators
    by taking into account their specific properties (notably their shed profiles),
    conditions of the site, the application and the type of system,<br />\r\n- evaluate
    the relative advantages and disadvantages of the possible solutions, using HTM
    or non-HTM insulators,<br />\r\n- assess the need and merits of \"hybrid\" solutions
    or mitigative measures.<br />\r\nThe IEC 60815 series does not deal with the effects
    of ice and snow on polluted insulators.<br />\r\nCIGRE documents form a useful
    complement to this technical specification for those wishing to study in greater
    depth the performance of insulators under pollution.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC TS 60815‑1 published in 2008. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    In the Scope, it is clarified that this specification is applicable to AC and
    DC conditions while it mainly refers to AC conditions. Detailed application indications
    refer to AC only. The RUSCD is determined based on the SPS class of reference
    insulators, and this document does not deal with the effects of ice and snow on
    polluted insulators;<br />\r\nb) Some terms and definitions are modified or introduced
    in this document, such as RUSCD, creepage factor, average diameter, SPS value
    and SPS class, hydrophobicity transfer and HTM, etc.;<br />\r\nc) Clause 5 is
    re-organized and revised regarding input parameters for the selection and dimensioning
    of insulators, including system requirements and environmental conditions;<br
    />\r\nd) Clause 6 \"Determination of site pollution severity (SPS) class\" is
    re-organized and re-written. A distinction was made between SPS value and SPS
    class. The measurement of pollution that is made on the de-energized reference
    insulator is valid for AC only;<br />\r\ne) A new pollution class, extremely heavy
    class f, is added. It is applicable only to the special situations of extremely
    heavy pollution when the RUSCD of class e cannot meet the requirements. The RUSCD
    value for class f is not specified;<br />\r\nf) The parameters of reference insulators
    were defined;<br />\r\ng) The profiles of reference insulators for type B pollution,
    both cap-and-pin and long rod insulators were added in this revision. The severity
    interval for pollution class definition was differentiated for cap and pin insulators
    and long rod insulators for type B pollution, as already foreseen for type A pollution;<br
    />\r\nh) The DDDG measurement method was also revised;<br />\r\ni) From RUSCD
    of reference insulator to USCD of candidate insulator, the correction factors
    are introduced and revised, such as altitude correction, diameter correction,
    shed profile correction and parallel insulator number correction;<br />\r\nj)
    Profile suitability on ceramic and glass insulators was simplified;<br />\r\nk)
    The general guidance on materials is revised. The concept of hydrophobicity transfer
    and hydrophobicity transfer material (HTM) are introduced, recognising that a
    reduced creepage distance may be used for HTM insulators;<br />\r\nl) In the laboratory
    artificial pollution test for solid layer, the relation between SDD and ESDD is
    revised;<br />\r\nm) The statistical method is updated."
