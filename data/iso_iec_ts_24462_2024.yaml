abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines an inventory of building blocks
    conceptually associated with different types of assessments of information and
    communication technology (ICT) trustworthiness. These assessments apply to areas
    such as governance, risk management, security evaluation, secure development lifecycle
    (SDL), supply chain integrity and privacy. This document also defines an ontology
    that organizes these building blocks and provides instructions for using the inventory
    of building blocks and the ontology.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Formalizing the
    types, categories, and structural characteristics of building blocks in the area
    of ICT trustworthiness assessment aims to increase efficiency and improve future
    harmonization in standards development and their use. Building blocks can refer
    to structural components as well as semantic components. These components can
    be connected to a variety of concepts and activities related to trustworthiness
    assessments, including process related, such as traceability or elements of assessment
    methodologies.</p>
