The repository stores the history of the transitions in states of the economic claim and/or other business entities that happen over the course of a business transaction, and does so for a collection of business events. These business events, comprised of transactions and their states, can be identified unambiguously so as to provide the ability to inspect or query the information at some point after the record has been made. The distributed nature of the repository offers users ubiquitous and robust access to the recorded history.</span></p>

For best performance, candidate technologies would likely exhibit properties of long-term permanence, robust immutability, decentralized access, distributed resilience, and fine-grained addressability.</span></p>
