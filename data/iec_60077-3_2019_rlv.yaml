abstract:
- content: "IEC 60077-3:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60077-3:2019 gives the rules
    for circuit-breakers, the main contacts of which are connected to DC power and/or
    auxiliary circuits. The nominal voltage of these circuits does not exceed 3 000
    V DC according to IEC 60850. This part of IEC 60077, together with IEC 60077-2,
    states specifically:<br />\r\na) the characteristics of the circuit-breakers;<br
    />\r\nb) the service conditions with which circuit-breakers complies with reference
    to:<br />\r\n- operation and behaviour in normal service;<br />\r\n- operation
    and behaviour in the case of short circuit<br />\r\n- dielectric properties;<br
    />\r\nc) the tests for confirming the compliance of the components with the characteristics
    under the service conditions and the methods to be adopted for these tests;<br
    />\r\nd) the information to be marked on, or given with, the circuit breaker.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, issued in 2001.
    This edition includes the following main technical changes with regard to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- procedure of verification of temperature rise is
    changed;<br />\r\n- air-tightness test as type test, insulation resistance measurement
    are added.</p>"
