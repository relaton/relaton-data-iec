  content: "IEC 60794-2-20:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-2-20:2024
    is part of a family specification covering multi-fibre optical cables for indoor
    use. The requirements of the sectional specification IEC 60794-2 are applicable
    to cables covered by this document. Annex B contains a blank detail specification
    and general guidance in case the cables are intended to be used in installations
    governed by the MICE table of ISO/IEC 11801-1. This fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update of the normative references;<br
    />\r\nb) review update of parameters and requirements for mechanical tests and
    environmental tests, maintaining alignment with additional relevant standards
    in the IEC 60794-2 series;<br />\r\nc) addition of cabled fibre attenuation requirements;<br
    />\r\nd) addition of cable design examples.<br />\r\nThis document is to be used
    in conjunction with IEC 60794-1-1:2023, IEC 60794-1-2:2021, IEC 60794‑1‑21:2015
    and IEC 60794‑1‑21:2015/AMD:2020, IEC 60794-1-22:2017, IEC 60794‑1-23:2019 and
