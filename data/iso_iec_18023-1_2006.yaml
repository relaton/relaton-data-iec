abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18023-1:2005 addresses the concepts, syntax and semantics for the representation
    and interchange of environmental data. It specifies:<br />\r\na data representation
    model for expressing environmental data;<br />\r\nspecifications of the data types
    and classes that together constitute the data representation model; and<br />\r\nan
    application program interface that supports the storage and retrieval of environmental
    data using the data representation model.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18023-1:2005
    also specifies topological, rule-based, and other constraints that ensure appropriate
    data can be available for applications that rely on automatically generated behaviours
    when interacting with environmental data."
