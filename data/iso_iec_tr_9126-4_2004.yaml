abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 9126-4:2004 provides quality in use metrics for measuring the
    attributes defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1. ISO/IEC TR 9126-2 defines external metrics
    and ISO/IEC TR 9126-3 defines internal metrics for measurement of the subcharacteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1. Internal metrics measure the software itself, external
    metrics measure the behaviour of the computer-based system that includes the software,
    and quality in use metrics measure the effects of using the software in a specific
    context of use.The metrics listed in ISO/IEC TR 9126-4 are not intended to be
    an exhaustive set. Developers, evaluators, quality managers and acquirers may
    select metrics from ISO/IEC TR 9126-4 for defining requirements, evaluating software
    products, measuring quality aspects and other purposes.ISO/IEC TR 9126-2 is intended
    to be used together with ISO/IEC 9126-1.ISO/IEC TR 9126-4 contains:-- an explanation
    of how to apply software quality metrics;-- a basic set of metrics for each characteristic;
    and-- an example of how to apply metrics during the software product life cycle.It
    includes as informative annexes a quality in use evaluation process and a reporting
    format.
