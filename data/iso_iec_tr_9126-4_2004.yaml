abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 9126-4:2004 provides quality in use metrics for measuring
    the attributes defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1. ISO/IEC TR 9126-2<em></em>defines external
    metrics and ISO/IEC TR 9126-3 defines internal metrics for measurement of the
    subcharacteristics defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1. Internal metrics measure the software
    itself, external metrics measure the behaviour of the computer-based system that
    includes the software, and quality in use metrics measure the effects of using
    the software in a specific context of use.</p><p>The metrics listed in ISO/IEC
    TR 9126-4<em></em>are not intended to be an exhaustive set. Developers, evaluators,
    quality managers and acquirers may select metrics from ISO/IEC TR 9126-4<em></em>for
    defining requirements, evaluating software products, measuring quality aspects
    and other purposes.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 9126-2<em></em>is intended to be used together
    with ISO/IEC 9126-1.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 9126-4 contains:</p><p>-- an explanation
    of how to apply software quality metrics;</p><p>-- a basic set of metrics for
    each characteristic; and</p><p>-- an example of how to apply metrics during the
    software product life cycle.</p><p>It includes as informative annexes a quality
    in use evaluation process and a reporting format.</p>"
