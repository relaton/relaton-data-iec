  content: IEC/PAS 61158-3-22:2009(E) provides common elements for basic time-critical
    messaging communications between devices in an automation environment. The term
    "time-critical" is used to represent the presence of a time-window, within which
    one or more specified actions are required to be completed with some defined level
    of certainty. Failure to complete specified actions within the time window risks
    failure of the applications requesting the actions, with attendant risk to equipment,
    plant and possibly human life. It contains an additional profile - SNpTYPE - which
    may be integrated into a future new edition of the IEC 61158-3 series.
