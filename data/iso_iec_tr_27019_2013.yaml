abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013 provides guiding principles based on ISO/IEC
    27002 for information security management applied to process control systems as
    used in the energy utility industry. The aim of ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013 is to extend
    the ISO/IEC 27000 set of standards to the domain of process control systems and
    automation technology, thus allowing the energy utility industry to implement
    a standardized information security management system (ISMS) in accordance with
    ISO/IEC 27001 that extends from the business to the process control level.</p><p>The
    scope of ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013 covers process control systems used by the energy
    utility industry for controlling and monitoring the generation, transmission,
    storage and distribution of electric power, gas and heat in combination with the
    control of supporting processes. This includes in particular the following systems,
    applications and components:</p><ul><li>the overall IT-supported central and distributed
    process control, monitoring and automation technology as well as IT systems used
    for their operation, such as programming and parameterization devices;</li><li>digital
    controllers and automation components such as control and field devices or PLCs,
    including digital sensor and actuator elements;</li><li>all further supporting
    IT systems used in the process control domain, e.g. for supplementary data visualization
    tasks and for controlling, monitoring, data archiving and documentation purposes;</li><li>the
    overall communications technology used in the process control domain, e.g. networks,
    telemetry, telecontrol applications and remote control technology;</li><li>digital
    metering and measurement devices, e.g. for measuring energy consumption, generation
    or emission values;</li><li>digital protection and safety systems, e.g. protection
    relays or safety PLCs;</li><li>distributed components of future smart grid environments;</li><li>all
    software, firmware and applications installed on above mentioned systems.</li></ul><p>Outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013 is the conventional or classic control equipment
    that is non-digital, i.e. purely electro-mechanical or electronic monitoring and
    process control systems. Furthermore, energy process control systems in private
    households and other, comparable residential building installations are outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013.</p><p>Telecommunication systems and components
    used in the process control environment are also not directly part of the scope
    of ISO/IEC TR 27019:2013. These are covered by ISO/IEC 27011:2008.</p>"
