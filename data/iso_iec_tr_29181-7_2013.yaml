    ISO/IEC TR 29181-7:2013 describes the problem statement, requirements and a functional building block for the Future Network (FN) from the perspective of service composition. The goal of ISO/IEC TR 29181-7:2013 is to:
    - analyse and classify problems of the current solutions on the service composition,
    - identify requirements on the service composition for the FN,
    - describe some technical aspects of the service composition for the FN, and
    - propose a functional building block of the service composition including functional components and their reference points among them.

    ISO/IEC TR 29181-7:2013 also introduces various on-going standardization and research activities related to service composition.
