- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29181-7:2013 describes the problem statement, requirements
    and a functional building block for the Future Network (FN) from the perspective
    of service composition. The goal of ISO/IEC TR 29181-7:2013 is to:</p><ol><li>analyse
    and classify problems of the current solutions on the service composition,</li><li>identify
    requirements on the service composition for the FN,</li><li>describe some technical
    aspects of the service composition for the FN, and</li><li>propose a functional
    building block of the service composition including functional components and
    their reference points among them.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC TR 29181-7:2013 also introduces
    various on-going standardization and research activities related to service composition.</p>"
