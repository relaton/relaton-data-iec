abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    rapid growth of distributed processing has lead to a need for a coordinating framework
    for the standardization of Open Distributed Processing (ODP). This Reference Model
    of ODP provides such a framework. It creates an architecture within which support
    of distribution, interworking, interoperability and portability can be integrated.<br
    />\r\nThe Basic Reference Model of Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP), (see
    ITU-T Recs. X.901 to X.904 | ISO/IEC 10746), is based on precise concepts derived
    from current distributed processing developments and, as far as possible, on the
    use of formal description techniques for specification of the architecture.<br
    />\r\nThe RM-ODP consists of:<br />\r\n- ITU-T Rec. X.901 | ISO/IEC 10746-1: 2YHUYLHZ:_
    Contains a motivational overview of ODP giving scooping, justification and explanation
    of key concepts, and an outline of ODP architecture. This part is not normative.<br
    />\r\n- ITU-T Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2: )RXQGDWLRQV:_ Contains the definition
    of the concepts and analytical framework and notation for normalized description
    of (arbitrary) distributed processing systems. This is only to a level of detail
    sufficient to support ITU-T Rec. X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3 and to establish requirements
    for new specification techniques. This part is normative.<br />\r\n- ITU-T Rec.
    X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3: $UFKLWHFWXUH: Contains_ the specification of the required
    characteristics that qualify distributed processing as open. These are the constraints
    to which ODP standards must conform. It uses the descriptive techniques from ITU-T
    Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2.<br />\r\nThis part is normative.<br />\r\n- ITU-T
    Rec. X.904 | ISO/IEC 10746-4: $UFKLWHFWXUDO_6HPDQWLFV:_Contains a formalisation
    of the ODP modeling concepts defined in ITU-T Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2, clauses
    8 and 9, and a formalisation of the viewpoint languages of ITU-T Rec. X.903 |
    ISO/IEC 10746-3. The formalisation is achieved by interpreting each concept in
    terms of the constructs of the different standardized formal description techniques.
    This part is normative.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this Recommendation | International
    Standard is to provide an architectural semantics for ODP. This essentially takes
    the form of an interpretation of the basic modeling and specification concepts
    of ITU-T Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2 and viewpoint languages of ITU-T Rec. X.903
    | ISO/IEC 10746-3, using the various features of different formal specification
    languages. An architectural semantics is developed in four different formal specification
    languages: LOTOS, ESTELLE, SDL and Z. The result is a formalization of ODP's architecture.
    Through a process of iterative development and feedback, this has improved the
    consistency of ITU-T Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2 and ITU-T Rec. X.903 | ISO/IEC
    10746-3.<br />\r\nAn architectural semantics provides the additional benefits
    of:<br />\r\n- assisting the sound and uniform development of formal descriptions
    of ODP systems; and<br />\r\n- of permitting uniform and consistent comparison
    of formal descriptions of the same standard in different formal specification
    languages.<br />\r\nRather than provide a mapping from all the concepts of ITU-T
    Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2, this Recommendation | International Standard focuses
    on the most basic. A semantics for the higher level architectural concepts is
    provided indirectly through their definition in terms of the basic ODP concepts.<br
    />\r\nExamples of the use of some of the formal specification languages in this
    report can be found in TR 10167 (Guidelines for the Application of ESTELLE, LOTOS
    and SDL).<br />\r\nIn the following clauses, the concepts are numbered in accordance
    with the scheme used in ITU-T Rec. X.902 | ISO/IEC 10746-2.<br />\r\nThis Recommendation
    | International Standard specifies an architectural semantics for ODP. This is
    required to:<br />\r\n- provide formalisation of the ODP modelling concepts;<br
    />\r\n- assist sound and uniform development of formal descriptions of standards
    for distributed systems;<br />\r\n- act as a bridge between the ODP modelling
    concepts and the semantic models of the specification languages: LOTOS, SDL, ESTELLE
    and Z;<br />\r\n- provide a basis for uniform and consistent comparison between
    formal descriptions of the same standard in specification languages that are used
    to develop an architectural semantics. This part is normative."
