    <p>ISO/IEC 15963:2004 describes numbering systems that are available for the identification of RF tags. </p>
    <p>A unique ID is required as part of the write operation to RFID tags. The unique ID guarantees that the information written to a tag is unambiguously written to the correct data carrier (tag). A unique ID is also required in many read situations where the contents of the tag are tied to a specific item and that item needs to be unambiguously identified.</p>
    <p>The unique ID may also be used</p>
    <ul><li>for the traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in their manufacturing process;</li><li>for the traceability of the RF tag during its manufacturing process and along its lifetime;</li><li>for the completion of the reading in a multi-antenna configuration; </li><li>by the anti-collision mechanism, to inventory multiple tags in the reader's field of view;</li><li>for the traceability of the item to which the RF tag is attached.</li></ul>
