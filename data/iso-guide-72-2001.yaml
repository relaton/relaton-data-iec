  content: "This Guide provides<br />\r\n* guidance for justifying and evaluating
    a proposed management system standard project with a view to assessing market
    relevance,<br />\r\n* guidance on the methodology (process) of developing and
    maintaining (i.e. reviewing and revising) management system standards with a view
    to ensuring compatibility and enhancing alignment, and<br />\r\n* guidance on
    the terminology, structure and common elements of management system standards
    with a view to ensuring compatibility as well as enhancing alignment and ease
    of use.<br />\r\nThis guidance is in addition to the procedures for technical
    work and the methodology for the development of International Standards established
    by the ISO/IEC Directives. This Guide makes a distinction between three different
    types of management system standard (MSS), as follows.<br />\r\n* Type A: management
    system requirements standards, both generic and sector-specific.<br />\r\n* Type
    B: management system guidelines standards, both generic and sector-specific.<br
    />\r\n* Type C: management system related standards.<br />\r\nWhilst this Guide
    is aimed primarily at Type A MSSs, it is equally applicable to Type B. This Guide
    is also applicable to Type C with the exception of 7.3 relating to the MSS structure
    and common elements. This Guide is intended to be used by all ISO bodies involved
    in the development of management system requirements and guidelines standards,
    and management system related standards. It can also be used by non-ISO standards
    development organizations at the international, regional or national level that
    are considering or are in the process of developing management system standards
    and/or comparable documents. It should be emphasized that this Guide does not
    serve as a integrated management system standard. It is intended to be used by
    standards writers. It is not intended to be used by organizations implementing
    management system standards nor for certification purposes."
