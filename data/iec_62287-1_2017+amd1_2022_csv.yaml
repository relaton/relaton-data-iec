abstract:
- content: 'IEC 62287-1:2017+AMD1:2022 specifies the minimum operational and performance
    requirements, methods of testing and required test results for Class B shipborne
    automatic identification system (AIS) equipment using carrier-sense time division
    multiple access (CSTDMA) techniques. This document takes into account other associated
    IEC International Standards and existing national standards, as applicable. It
    is applicable for AIS equipment used on craft that are not covered by the mandatory
    carriage requirement of AIS under SOLAS Chapter V. An AIS station intended to
    operate in receive-only mode is not considered a Class B shipborne mobile AIS
    station. This edition includes the following significant technical change with
    respect to the previous edition: in the synchronisation method, addition of a
    direct method for synchronisation from an internal UTC source.'
