abstract:
- content: "IEC 63182-6:2025 specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical
    interchangeability for a preferred range of EQ-cores made of metallic magnetic
    powder, the essential dimensions of coil formers to be used with them as well
    as the effective parameter values to be used in calculations involving them and
    gives guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable to EQ-cores.<br
    />\r\nThis document is a specification that is useful in the negotiations between
    magnetic powder core manufacturers and customers about surface irregularities.<br
    />\r\nThe use of \"derived\" standards which give more detailed specifications
    of component parts while still permitting conformance with this document is discussed
    in Annex A."
