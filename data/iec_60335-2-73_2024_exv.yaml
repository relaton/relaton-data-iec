abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-73:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-73:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-73:2024 deals with the safety
    of fixed electric immersion heaters for household and similar purposes that are
    intended for installation in a water tank open to the atmosphere for heating water
    to a temperature below its boiling point with a rated voltage of not more than
    250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances. The water tank can have alternative means for
    heating water, such as the circulation of hot water supplied from a separate boiler.
    Immersion heaters having a rated power input up to 25 kW for incorporation as
    an alternative heating source in central heating boilers are also within the scope
    of this standard. Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of
    this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the
    common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in
    and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n-
    persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or
    lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\nappliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- heating elements incorporated in
    appliances such as appliances for heating liquids (IEC 60335-2-15), storage water
    heaters (IEC 60335-2-21) and instantaneous water heaters (IEC 60335-2-35);<br
    />\r\n- aquarium heaters (IEC 60335-2-55);<br />\r\n- portable immersion heaters
    (IEC 60335-2-74);<br />\r\n- engine preheaters such as those for cars and buses.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2002, Amendment 1: 2006 and Amendment 2: 2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC
    60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause
    1, 19.2);<br />\r\nc) addition of external accessible surface temperatures (Clause
    11);<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1:2020 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that
    case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established
    on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
