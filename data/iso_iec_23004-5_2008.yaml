abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23004-5:2008 specifies the interfaces of the support application
    programming interface (API) and the realization technology used for Component
    Download in MPEG Multimedia Middleware (M3W). Component Download is an optional
    framework for M3W Platforms. The goal of this realization technology is to enable
    controlled download of software components to a device. In this context controlled
    means that before the actual transfer of the component we are able to assess whether
    the component actually "fits". ISO/IEC 23004-5:2008 specifies the following entities.
    Repository - contains components that can be downloaded. Target - enables receiving
    components. Locator - responsible for locating all the entities (realization of
    the roles) that participate in a particular download. Decider - assesses the feasibility
    of a particular download (this can include technical fit, business fit, etc.).
    Initiator - initiates and coordinates the download process.These entities together
    enable through different deployments a large number of component download and
    upload scenarios, varying from point-to-point transfer to broadcast of components.
