  content: "IEC 62899-201-2:2021(E) defines measurement methods for the properties
    of stretchable substrates, in order to use evaluating stretchable functional layers
    (conductive, semiconducting, and insulating) formed by printing technologies.
    If the same types of materials as the substrates are used for the cover lay film,
    they are also subjected to the measurement defined in this document.<br />\r\nStretchable
    substrates handled by this document apply to substrates subjected to repeated
    bending with wiring elements demanding a high level of performance, such as fabric
    integrated wearable devices or skin patchable devices.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not define the required characteristics of the stretchable substrate. It
    provides test methods to characterize (pre-qualify) the substrates that are intended
    to be used for printing conductors and insulators for the purposes of manufacturing
    stretchable layers or structures."
