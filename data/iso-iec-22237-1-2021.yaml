    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>a) describes the general principles for data centres upon which the requirements of the ISO/IEC22237 series are based;</p>
    <p>b) defines the common aspects of data centres including terminology, parameters and reference models (functional elements and their accommodation) addressing both the size and complexity of their intended purpose;</p>
    <p>c) describes general aspects of the facilities and infrastructures required to support data centres;</p>
    <p>d) specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of “availability”, “security” and “energy-efficiency” over the planned lifetime of the data centre, for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;</p>
    <p>e) details the issues to be addressed in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling application of the classification of the data centre;</p>
    <p>f) provides a reference to the operation and management of data centres.</p>
    <p>The following topics are outside of the scope of the ISO/IEC 22237 series:</p>
    <p>1)    the selection of information technology and network telecommunications equipment, software and associated configuration issues are outside the scope of this International Standard;</p>
    <p>2)    quantitative analysis of overall service availability resulting from multi-site data centres;</p>
    <p>3)    safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements (covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations).</p>
