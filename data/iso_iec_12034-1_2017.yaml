abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 12034-1:2017 is Part 1 of a series of documents that specify a
    general-purpose format for the storage and/or communication of information in
    bulk form. The format is named the Archive eXchange Format (AXF). The format described
    is intended both for interchange between systems and to serve as a native format
    within systems.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 12034-1:2017 identifies two major categories
    of data storage media and specifies the basic structures of data stored on those
    Storage Media Types. It specifies a number of structural elements for use in constructing
    the appropriate structures for use on each of the Storage Media Types. It defines
    the semantics of data contained within fields specified for use in the structural
    elements. The structural elements themselves are documents coded in the eXtensible
    Markup Language (XML), and this document defines an XML Schema Description (XSD)
    file for use in formulating the XML documents to be used for the structural elements
    of AXF Objects."
