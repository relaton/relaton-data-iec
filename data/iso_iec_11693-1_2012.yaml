abstract:
- content: The intent of ISO/IEC 11693-1:2012 is to provide necessary information
    for card manufacturers, card issuers, and card users interested in interchanging
    information encoded on optical memory cards.  ISO/IEC 11693-1:2012 serves as a
    guide to companies who plan to develop equipment and systems using optical memory
    cards. The data content and use of the cards depend upon the applications developed
    by each industry group.
