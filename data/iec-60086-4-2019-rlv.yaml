  content: "IEC 60086-4:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60086-4:2019
    specifies tests and requirements for primary lithium batteries to ensure their
    safe operation under intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse. NOTE Primary
    lithium batteries that are standardized in IEC 60086-2 are expected to meet all
    applicable requirements herein. It is understood that consideration of this part
    of IEC 60086 might also be given to measuring and/or ensuring the safety of non-standardized
    primary lithium batteries. In either case, no claim or warranty is made that compliance
    or non-compliance with this standard will fulfil or not fulfil any of the user’s
    particular purposes or needs. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Revised criteria for an explosion;<br />\r\nb) Addition
    of test parameters for the overdischarge test of battery types FR14505 and FR10G445;<br
    />\r\nc) Addition of a new subclause 5.1 Validity of Testing;<br />\r\nd) revised
    pictogram E in Table D.1;<br />\r\ne) Addition of Annex E with requirements for
    child resistant packaging of coin cells;<br />\r\nf) Addition of Annex F with
    recommendations on the use of the KEEP OUT OF REACH OF CHILDREN safety sign.<br
    />\r\nKeywords: lithium batteries<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of
    October 2019 and April 2020 and the Interpretation sheet of May 2020 have been
    included in this copy."
