abstract:
- content: "CISPR 11:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nCISPR 11:2015 applies
    to industrial, scientific and medical electrical equipment operating in the frequency
    range 0 Hz to 400 GHz and to domestic and similar appliances designed to generate
    and/or use locally radio-frequency energy. This standard covers emission requirements
    related to radio-frequency (RF) disturbances in the frequency range of 9 kHz to
    400 GHz. Measurements need only be performed in frequency ranges where limits
    are specified in Clause 6. For ISM RF applications in the meaning of the definition
    found in the ITU Radio Regulations (see Definition 3.13), this standard covers
    emission requirements related to radio-frequency disturbances in the frequency
    range of 9 kHz to 18 GHz. Requirements for ISM RF lighting equipment and UV irradiators
    operating at frequencies within the ISM frequency bands defined by the ITU Radio
    Regulations are contained in this standard. Equipment covered by other CISPR product
    and product family emission standards are excluded from the scope of this standard.
    This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2009 and
    its Amendment 1 published in 2010. It constitutes a technical revision. It introduces
    and permits type testing on components of power electronic equipment, systems
    and installations. Its emission limits apply now to low voltage (LV) a.c. and
    d.c. power ports, irrespective of the direction of power transmission. Several
    limits were adapted to the practical test conditions found at test sites. They
    are also applicable now to power electronic ISM RF equipment used for wireless
    power transfer (WPT), for instant power supply and charging purposes. The limits
    in the range 1 GHz to 18 GHz apply now to CW-type disturbances and to fluctuating
    disturbances in a similar, uniform and technology-neutral way. For these measurements,
    two alternative methods of measurement are available, the traditional log-AV method
    and the new APD method. It has the status of a Product Family EMC standard in
    accordance with IEC Guide 107, Electromagnetic compatibility - Guide to the drafting
    of electromagnetic compatibility publications (2014)."
