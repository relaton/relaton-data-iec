abstract:
- content: "CISPR 16-1-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nCISPR 16-1-1:2015 specifies
    the characteristics and performance of equipment for the measurement of radio
    disturbance in the frequency range 9 kHz to 18 GHz. In addition, requirements
    are provided for specialized equipment for discontinuous disturbance measurements.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2010,
    Amendment 1:2010 and Amendment 2:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the Interpretation Sheet 1 of April 2018 have been included
    in this copy."
