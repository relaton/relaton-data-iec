  content: "IEC TR 62691:2016(E) which is a Technical Report, gives recommendations
    for handling and installing optical fibre cables on metropolitan communication
    networks. Installation methods covered by this document include underground ducts,
    trenchless technique, blowing in microducts, aerial installation on poles, lashed
    aerial in metropolitan networks, direct buried and use of trenches. Special installation
    situations such as tunnelling and lead-in installations, on-bridges, underwater,
    use of sanitary sewers, high pressure gas pipes and drinking water pipes are commented
    and detailed. Installation and maintenance of optical fibre cables on overhead
    power lines including the following are not covered by this document and are referred
    to in IEC TR 62263:<br />\r\n- optical ground wire (OPGW) fibre cable;<br />\r\n-
    optical phase conductor (OPPC) fibre cable;<br />\r\n- optical attached fibre
    cable (OPAC);<br />\r\n- all dielectric self-supporting (ADSS) optical fibre cable.
    IEC TR 62263 includes an extensive coverage on recommendations to ensure the safety
    of personnel and equipment when installing or maintaining these types of optical
    fibre cables on overhead power lines. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2011. It constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- more details have been added on cables for lashed
    applications (transferred from IEC 60794-3-10);<br />\r\n- more details have been
    added on cables for storm and sanitary sewer applications (transferred from IEC
    60794-3-40);<br />\r\n- more details have been added on cables for high pressure
    gas pipe applications (transferred from IEC 60794-3-50);<br />\r\n- more details
    have been added on cables for drinking water pipe applications (transferred from
    IEC 60794-3-60);<br />\r\n- a reference to IEC TR 62263 has been included, concerning
    optical cables installation on high voltage power lines;<br />\r\n- a revision,
    and an update when applicable, has been done on the referred documents. Keywords:
    metropolitan communication networks, underground ducts, trenchless technique,
    blowing in microducts, aerial installation on poles, lashed aerial in metropolitan
    networks, direct buried and use of trenches."
