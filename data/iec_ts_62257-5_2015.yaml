abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-5:2015(E) specifies the general requirements for the protection
    of persons and equipment against electrical hazards to be applied in decentralised
    rural electrification systems. Requirements dealing with protection against electric
    shock are based on basic rules from IEC 61140 and IEC 60364. Decentralized Rural
    Electrification Systems are designed to supply electric power for sites which
    are not connected to a large interconnected system, or a national grid, in order
    to meet basic needs. Examples of such sites: isolated dwellings, village houses,
    community services, economic activities, etc. The main technical changes with
    regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- redefine the maximum
    AC voltage from 500 V to 1 000 V, the maximum DC voltage from 750 V to 1 500 V;<br
    />\r\n- removal of the limitation of 100 kVA system size.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62257 series."
