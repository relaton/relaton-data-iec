abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 29167-15:2017 defines a coding suite based on an exclusive
    or (XOR) operation for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces standards for radio frequency
    identification (RFID) systems. In particular, it specifies the use of XOR as a
    basic way to hide plain data in the identity authentication and secure communication
    procedures. The coding suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TS 29167-15:2017 defines various authentication methods and methods
    of use for the XOR. A tag and an interrogator may support one, a subset, or all
    of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported."
