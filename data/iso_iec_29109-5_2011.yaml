abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29109-5:2011 supports applications using face images formatted
    according to ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005. It defines conformance test assertions that
    allow a receiving system to check the encoding requirements of ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005
    are met and are internally consistent. Formally, ISO/IEC 29109-5:2011 establishes
    requirements for a conformance test suite that assesses conformity of ISO/IEC
    19794-5:2005 records from conformant products. It is intended primarily for use
    by testing organizations, but can be applied by developers and users of test method
    specifications and test method implementations. It does not establish tests for
    checking the visual appearance requirements of an ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 face.</p>"
