abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62715-5-4:2019 (E) specifies the measuring conditions and measuring
    methods for determining the blur of objects when viewed through a flexible transparent
    display. This document mainly applies to flexible transparent display modules
    that have a constant radius curvature about a single axis. The display is measured
    in a static mechanical state.
