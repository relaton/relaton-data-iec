  content: "IEC 62108:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62108:2022
    specifies the minimum requirements for the design qualification and type approval
    of concentrator photovoltaic (CPV) modules and assemblies suitable for long-term
    operation in general open-air climates as defined in IEC 60721-2-1. The object
    of this test document is to determine the electrical, mechanical, and thermal
    characteristics of the CPV modules and assemblies and to show, as far as possible
    within reasonable constraints of cost and time, that the CPV modules and assemblies
    are capable of withstanding prolonged exposure in climates described in the scope."
