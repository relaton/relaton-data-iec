abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-1-111:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61196-1-111:2024
    provides test methods to determine the stability of phase of coaxial communication
    cables. This document is applicable to RF coaxial cables. RF coaxial cable assemblies
    can also use this document for reference. This part of IEC 61196 comprises following
    test methods:<br />\r\na) phase variation with temperature (Clause 4);<br />\r\nb)
    phase constant variation with temperature (Clause 5);<br />\r\nc) phase stability
    with bending (Clause 6);<br />\r\nd) phase stability with twisting (Clause 7);<br
    />\r\ne) phase consistency test for two or more cables (Annex A);<br />\r\nf)
    phase variation with temperature test between two cables (Annex B).<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    addition of the list of test methods in the Scope;<br />\r\nb) addition of \"the
    number of scanning points\" in every test method;<br />\r\nc) addition of Annex
    A, Phase consistency test for two or more cables;<br />\r\nd) addition of Annex
    B, Phase variation with temperature test between two cables."
