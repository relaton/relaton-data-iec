abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-46:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60793-1-46:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 60793-1-46:2001
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 86A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-46:2024 establishes uniform requirements for the monitoring
    of changes in attenuation, thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables
    for commercial purposes. This document gives two methods for monitoring the changes
    in attenuation of optical fibres and cables that occur during mechanical or environmental
    testing, or both. It provides a monitor in the change of attenuation characteristics
    arising from optical discontinuity, physical defects and modifications of the
    attenuation slope:<br />\r\n- method A: change in attenuation by transmitted power;<br
    />\r\n- method B: change in attenuation by backscattering.<br />\r\nMethods A
    and B apply to the monitoring of all categories of the following fibres:<br />\r\n-
    class A: multimode fibres;<br />\r\n- class B: single-mode fibres;<br />\r\n-
    class C: single-mode intraconnection fibres.<br />\r\nInformation common to both
    measurements is contained in Clause 1 to Clause 10, and information pertaining
    to each individual method appears in Annex A, and Annex B respectively."
