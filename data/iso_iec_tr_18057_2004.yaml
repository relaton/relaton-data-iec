    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 18057:2003 illustrates how ECMA-323 can be used in a Voice Browser environment.
    These concepts illustrated in this TR can be applied to any Voice Browser environment
    that provides an XML-based read/write messaging interface (i.e. CSTA Service Boundary)
    that supports asynchronous events from a CSTA conformant communication platform.
    SALT enabled browsers that implement a ECMA-323 interface for call control using
    the SALT smex mechanism is an example of a browser with this capability."
