abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 62541-2:2020 is available as IEC TR 62541-2:2020 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    62541-2:2020 describes the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) security model. It
    describes the security threats of the physical, hardware, and software environments
    in which OPC UA is expected to run. It describes how OPC UA relies upon other
    standards for security. It provides definition of common security terms that are
    used in this and other parts of the OPC UA specification. It gives an overview
    of the security features that are specified in other parts of the OPC UA specification.
    It references services, mappings, and Profiles that are specified normatively
    in other parts of the OPC UA Specification. It provides suggestions or best practice
    guidelines on implementing security. Any seeming ambiguity between this part and
    one of the other normative parts does not remove or reduce the requirement specified
    in the other normative part."
