  content: IEC/TR 62443-3-1:2009(E) provides a current assessment of various cybersecurity
    tools, mitigation counter-measures, and technologies that may effectively apply
    to the modern electronically based IACSs regulating and monitoring numerous industries
    and critical infrastructures. It describes several categories of control system-centric
    cybersecurity technologies, the types of products available in those categories,
    the pros and cons of using those products in the automated IACS environments,
    relative to the expected threats and known cyber vulnerabilities, and, most important,
    the preliminary recommendations and guidance for using these cybersecurity technology
    products and/or countermeasures.
