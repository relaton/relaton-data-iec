abstract:
- content: "IEC 62561-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62561-2:2025
    specifies the requirements and tests for<br />\r\n- metallic conductors (other
    than \"natural\" conductors) that form part of the air-termination and down-conductor
    systems, and<br />\r\n- metallic earth electrodes that form part of the earth-termination
    system.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) definitions of new conductor types mentioned in this document
    have been added;<br />\r\nb) the document has been updated in line with IEC 60068-2-52:2017
    on salt mist treatment;<br />\r\nc) the document has been updated in line with
    ISO 22479:2019 on humid sulphurous atmosphere treatment;<br />\r\nd) a new normative
    Annex H for material, configuration and cross-sectional area test has been introduced;<br
    />\r\ne) a new normative Annex I for applicability of previous tests has been
    introduced.<br />\r\nf) equipotential earth grid has been introduced."
