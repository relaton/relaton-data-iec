abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30134-7:2023 This document specifies the cooling efficiency ratio
    (CER) as a key performance indicator (KPI) for quantifying the efficient use of
    energy to control the temperature of spaces within a data centre (DC).<br />\r\nThis
    document:<br />\r\na) defines the CER of a DC;<br />\r\nb) describes the relationship
    of this KPI to a DCâ€™s infrastructure, information technology equipment and information
    technology operations;<br />\r\nc) defines the measurement, the calculation and
    the reporting of the parameter; and<br />\r\nd) provides information on the correct
    interpretation of the CER.<br />\r\nAnnex A describes the correlation of the CER
    and other KPIs.<br />\r\nAnnex B provides examples of the usage of the CER.<br
    />\r\nAnnex C introduces the parameters that affect the CER.<br />\r\nAnnex D
    describes requirements and recommendations for derivatives of KPIs associated
    with the CER.<br />\r\nThis document is not applicable to cooling systems that
    are not powered by electricity (e.g. heat-driven absorption chillers)."
