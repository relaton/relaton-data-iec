    and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of dimensional requirements
    for grade 1 enamelled wire in Table 4;<br />\r\n- addition of dielectric breakdown
    requirements for grade 1 enamelled wire in Table 7.<br />\r\n- addition of requirement
    for the adherence test in 8.2.1 and 8.2.2."
