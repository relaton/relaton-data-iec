abstract:
- content: "IEC 60951-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60951-3:2022 provides general
    guidance on the design principles and performance criteria for equipment for continuous
    high range area gamma monitoring in nuclear facilities for accident and post-accident
    conditions. This document categorizes accident conditions into design basis accidents
    (DBA) and design extension conditions (DEC), including severe accident (SA). The
    purpose of this document is to lay down general requirements for equipment for
    continuous high range area gamma monitoring of radiation within the facility during
    and after accident conditions in nuclear facilities. This document is applicable
    to installed dose rate meters that are used to monitor high levels of gamma radiation
    during and after an accident. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2009.The main technical changes with regard to the previous
    edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- Title modified.<br />\r\n- To be consistent
    with the categorization of the accident condition.<br />\r\n- To update the references
    to new standards published since the second edition.<br />\r\n- To update the
    terms and definitions.<br />\r\nThis standard is to be read in conjunction with
    IEC 60951-1.</p>"
