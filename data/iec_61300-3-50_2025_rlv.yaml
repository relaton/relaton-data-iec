    describes the procedure to measure the crosstalk of optical signals between the
    ports of a multiport M x N (M input ports and N output ports) fibre optic spatial
    switch. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
