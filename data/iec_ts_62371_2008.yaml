abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62371:2008(E) is a Technical Specification which applies to ceramic
    and glass hollow insulators intended for general use in electrical equipment;
    and ceramic hollow insulators intended for use with a permanent gas pressure in
    switchgear and controlgear. This specification specifies the dimensional and mechanical
    characteristics of the hollow insulator, which are essential for interchangeability
    of the hollow insulator of the same type. It is not the object of this specification
    to prescribe electrical characteristics because they are dependent on the apparatus
    of which the hollow insulator ultimately forms a part. However, standard lightning
    impulse withstand voltage which is provided in IEC 60071-1 is described only for
    reference for classification purpose. This specification applies to hollow insulators
    for use in electrical equipment in clean areas or lightly polluted areas, where
    seismic qualification is not required.
