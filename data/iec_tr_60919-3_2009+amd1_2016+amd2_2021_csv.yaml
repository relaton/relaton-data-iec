abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60919-3:2009+A1:2016+A2:2021 provides general guidance on the dynamic
    performance of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. Dynamic performance
    is meant to include those events and phenomena whose characteristic frequencies
    or time domain cover the range between transient conditions and steady state.
    Diode valves are not considered in this specification. This report (IEC 60919-3)
    which covers dynamic performance, is accompanied by publications for steady-state
    (IEC 60919-1) and transient (IEC 60919-2) performance. All three aspects should
    be considered when preparing two-terminal HVDC system specifications. This report
    should not be used directly as a specification for a specific project, but rather
    to provide the basis for an appropriate specification tailored to fit actual system
    requirements for a particular electric power transmission scheme. This report
    does not intend to discriminate between the responsibility of users and manufacturers
    for the work specified. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition,
    which was issued as a technical specification in 1999. It constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) this report concerns only line-commutated
    converters;<br />\r\nb) significant changes have been made to the control system
    technology;<br />\r\nc) some environmental constraints, for example audible noise
    limits, have been added;<br />\r\nd) the capacitor coupled converters (CCC) and
    controlled series capacitor converters (CSCC) have been included."
