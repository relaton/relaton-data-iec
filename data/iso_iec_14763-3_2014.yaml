    and requirements for cabling interface adapters and test cords have been revised;&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- enhanced three-test-cord reference method has been introduced;&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- information on optical time domain reflectometry (Annex C) has
    been revised;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- examples of calculations of channel and permanent
    link limits (Annex G) have been revised and information regarding cleaning and
