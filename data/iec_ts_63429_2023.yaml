abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63429:2023 provides a test method for measuring the microbial contamination
    reduction performance of household washing machines with textile pieces contaminated
    with test microorganisms under standardized conditions. The microbial numbers
    on the contaminated textile pieces are measured before and after the washing programme
    and the reduction is calculated. Furthermore, a potential cross contamination
    from contaminated to uncontaminated textile pieces within the washing programme
    is measured.<br />\r\nThis document does not address the microbial contamination
    reduction due to any potential or claimed antimicrobial action of detergents as
    well as of bleach systems or any additives.<br />\r\nThis document applies to
    washing machines for household use, within the meaning that the scope of TC 59
    indicates for household use, including the washing related functions of washer-dryers.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to professional washing machines nor to commercial
    laundry operations associated with food service, hospital linens or other non-residential
    applications.<br />\r\nThis document deals with measurement procedures regarding
    the reduction of microbial contamination resulting from the use of electrical
    appliances for household and similar use. This document specifies methods that
    enable reproducible measurements. These derived measurement results can only be
    used for a relative statement. Absolute statements, i.e., health-related claims
    or conclusions about prevention or treatment of a disease or health improvement,
    are reserved for explicit regulatory action after a medical assessment.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to appliances intended to be used in medical, veterinary,
    or pharmaceutical applications.<br />\r\nThis document does not address sanitization,
    disinfection, or sterilization measures."
