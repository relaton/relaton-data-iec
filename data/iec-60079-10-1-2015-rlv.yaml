  content: "IEC 60079-10-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-10-1:2015(E)
    is concerned with the classification of areas where flammable gas or vapour hazards
    may arise and may then be used as a basis to support the proper selection and
    installation of equipment for use in hazardous areas. It is intended to be applied
    where there may be an ignition hazard due to the presence of flammable gas or
    vapour, mixed with air, but it does not apply to:<br />\r\n- mines susceptible
    to firedamp;<br />\r\n- the processing and manufacture of explosives;<br />\r\n-
    catastrophic failures or rare malfunctions which are beyond the concept of abnormality
    dealt with in this standard (see 3.7.3 and 3.7.4);<br />\r\n- rooms used for medical
    purposes;<br />\r\n- commercial and industrial applications where only low pressure
    fuel gas is used for appliances e.g. for cooking, water heating and similar uses,
    where the installation is compliant with relevant gas codes;<br />\r\n- domestic
    premises;<br />\r\n- where a hazard may arise due to the presence of combustible
    dusts or combustible flyings but the principles may be used in assessment of a
    hybrid mixture (refer also IEC 60079 10-2).<br />\r\nThis second edition of IEC
    60079-10-1 cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes
    a technical revision. The significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition are identified in the Foreward of the document. Keywords: ignition hazards,
    flammable gas or vapour, risk of explosions"
