abstract:
- content: IEC 62977-2-8:2025 specifies standard measurement conditions and methods
    for determining the optical characteristics of reflective direct view displays
    that render real 2D images on a flat panel. This document applies to flat panel
    displays operated in a reflective mode with any integrated light sources turned
    off during measurement. The input signal is unbounded and encodes either monochrome
    or colour images.
