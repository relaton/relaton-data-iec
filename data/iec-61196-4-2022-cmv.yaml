  content: "IEC 61196-4:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61196-4:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61196-4:2015
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 46A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61196-4:2022 applies to radiating coaxial communication cables,
    and specifies the terms and definitions, material and construction, IEC type designation,
    standard rating and characteristics, identification, marking and labelling, requirements
    of finished cables, quality assessment, delivery and storage, etc.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2015 This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. rewrote \"1 Scope\" to be consistent with
    other blank detail specifications of coaxial cables;\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">b.
    updated different standards in \"Clause 2 Normative references\";</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">c. added the definitions of uniformly radiating type
    cable, stop frequency band and link loss;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">d.
    added different materials and constructions in 4.2 to 4.5;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">e.
    added \"Clause 5 IEC type designation\";</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">f.
    added a detailed rated temperature range of different materials in \"6.2 Rated
    temperature range\";</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">g. added detailed
    frequencies in \"6.3 Operating frequency range\";</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">h.
    added \"6.4 Stop frequency band\" and \"6.5 Radiating characteristics\";</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">i. added different detail requirements or typical
    values in 8.2.4, 8.2.7, 8.2.8, 8.4.3 to 8.4.8;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">j.
    deleted \"7.4.4 Ovality of outer conductor\";</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">k.
    added \"8.2.11 Link loss\", \"8.4.9 Adhesion of dielectric\", \"8.4.10 Shrinkage
    for insulations\", \"8.4.11 Maximum pulling force of cable\";<br />\r\ni. used
    IEC 61196-1-123 and IEC 61196-1-124 in the electrical requirements to replace
    Annex A and Annex B respectively and deleted Annex A and Annex B;</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">m. added \"Figure A.1 Example of testing coupling
    loss around circumferential orientation of radiating cable (Y-Z)\" in Annex A.</div>"
