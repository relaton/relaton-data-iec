abstract:
- content: "IEC 63171-2:2021 covers 2-way, shielded or unshielded, free and fixed
    connectors for data transmission up to 600 MHz, with current-carrying capacity,
    known as Type 2. It specifies the common dimensions, mechanical, electrical and
    transmission characteristics and environmental requirements as well as test specifications
    respectively.<br />\r\nThe form factor of these connectors allows their use for
    cable sharing with already installed TOâ€™s for structured cabling.<br />\r\nThe
    overall performance of the transmission channel in such case has to be evaluated.<br
    />\r\nIntermateable and interoperable versions for circular connector for sealed
    applications including this connector are described in IEC 63171-5.<br />\r\nThe
    shielded and unshielded connectors are interoperable for their internal transmission
    performance and can be exchanged. The shielded version has improved alien crosstalk
    and coupling attenuation properties."
