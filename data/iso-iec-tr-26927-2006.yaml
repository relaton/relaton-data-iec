    <p>ISO/IEC TR 26927:2006 identifies key mobility issues for access to IP-based enterprise information and communications services. It defines a taxonomy of mobility terms and then explores use cases and connectivity scenarios involving mobile enterprise users. From these, it derives requirements for mobility management, architecture and security.</p>
    <p>Mobility for enterprise communication is about making desktop communication and information resources available at different locations and while on the move. ISO/IEC TR 26927:2006 encompasses both wired and wireless connectivity using enterprise and public all-IP networks for voice, data and converged services. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 26927:2006 is intended as an aid to analysing gaps in standardization that prevent or hinder mobility in enterprise communications and information access. More general interworking issues of enterprise communications are covered by a companion Technical Report, ISO/IEC TR 26905.</p>
