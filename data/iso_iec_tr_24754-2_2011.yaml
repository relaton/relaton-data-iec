abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 24754-2:2011 provides guidelines in the writing of formatting
    specifications targeted for document rendering systems supporting functionality
    described by ISO/IEC 24754-1. There is no scope of conformance constraints against
    which the use of these guidelines are measured. Possible user requirements for
    publishing layouts are unbounded. It is the user's obligation to describe their
    formatting requirements to be fulfilled by a developer or a compositor using a
    document rendering system. Using incomplete formatting specifications can delay
    achieving the desired rendered result.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 24754-2:2011
    is a specification of questions for the writer of a formatting specification.
    It is assumed that the writer of a formatting specification is unaware of the
    needs of the stylesheet writer in meeting the needs of the specification writer.
    For a writer aware of such needs, ISO/IEC TR 24754-2:2011 is a useful checklist
    of the issues to be considered.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 24754-2:2011 outlines
    various considerations users should assess when analysing their rendering expectations.
    Properties described by ISO/IEC TR 24754-2:2011 should be specified in sufficient
    detail such that a developer or compositor has the information required to engage
    the necessary facilities in the document rendering system.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 24754-2:2011 does not presume any particular stylesheet language with which
    to specify layout and formatting properties. Various stylesheet languages support
    different degrees of functionality described herein. Not all languages can assume
    to offer control over the properties described by ISO/IEC TR 24754-2:2011, yet
    it behoves the user to specify as much detail as possible so as to equip the developer
    or compositor for their task. By knowing as many nuances of layout as desired,
    there are more strategies available with which to accomplish a layout as close
    as possible to the requirements.<br /><br />\r\nMany components of ISO/IEC TR
    24754-2:2011 are presented to the reader as questions in the first person, so
    as to ask the reader to reflect on their requirements when answering the question."
