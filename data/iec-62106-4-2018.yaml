  content: "IEC 62106-4:2018 provides a number of tables for use in the implementation
    of the RDS system. This document specifies the procedure for registering a new
    value in an existing table or the registration of a new table.<br />\r\nIEC 62106-4:2018
    together with IEC 62106-1, IEC 62106-2, IEC 62106-3, IEC 62106-5 and IEC 62106-6,
    cancels and replaces IEC 62106:2015, and constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to IEC 62106:2015:<br />\r\n•    Provision has been made to carry RDS on multiple
    data-streams (RDS2).<br />\r\n•    The country identification table has been updated
    by adding some countries.<br />\r\n•    Translated PTY terms for 20 languages
    have been added."
