abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-13:2023 describes cables intended to be used for transmission
    of 10 Mbit/s over a single twisted pair and distances of up to 1 km. The transmission
    characteristics of these cables are specified up to a frequency of 20 MHz and
    at a temperature of 20 Â°C. Depending on the MICE environment and the installation
    conditions, either unscreened or screened cables can be used. Furthermore, to
    consider different maximum transmission lengths, two sets of requirements are
    specified. The cable type A-1000 is a design supporting up to 1 km channel length
    while the cable type A-400 is supporting up to 400 m channel length. A blank detail
    specification can be found in Annex A.<br />\r\nThe cables covered by this document
    are intended to operate with voltages and currents normally encountered in communication
    systems. While these cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low
    impedance sources, for example the electric power supplies of public utility mains,
    they are intended to be used to support the delivery of DC low voltage remote
    powering applications."
