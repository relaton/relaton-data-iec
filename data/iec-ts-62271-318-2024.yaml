  content: IEC TS 62271-318:2024 specifies requirements for gas-insulated metal-enclosed
    switchgear in which the insulation is obtained, at least partly, by an insulating
    gas or gas mixture other than air at atmospheric pressure, for direct current
    of rated voltages including and above 100 kV, for indoor and outdoor installation.
    This document includes rules for service conditions, ratings, design, and construction
    requirements. Test requirements and criteria for proof for passing type and routine
    tests are defined in this document for development and manufacturing of DC switchgear.
    For the purpose of this document, the terms "DC GIS" and "DC switchgear" are used
    for "DC gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear". This specification is applicable
    for both Line Commutated Converter (LCC) and Voltage Sourced Converter (VSC) for
    HVDC systems. The DC gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear covered by this document
    consists of individual components intended to be directly connected together and
    able to operate only in this manner. This document completes and amends, if applicable,
    the various relevant documents applying to the individual components constituting
    DC gas-insulated metal-enclosed switchgear.
