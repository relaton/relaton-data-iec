abstract:
- content: "<p>For the purposes of this International Standard, a portable computer
    is defined as a computer with a screen and an</p><p>attached keyboard that is
    capable of running on battery power for extended periods of time and is relatively
    easy to</p><p>transport from one location to another by a single individual.</p><p>This
    International Standard gives design guidance for product designers; this International
    Standard indicates those</p><p>requirements and recommendations contained in ISO/IEC
    9995 and ISO 9241-4:1998 that are to be considered in</p><p>designing portable
    computers keyboards.</p><p>This International Standard strives to maintain consistency,
    as far as practical, between keyboards for portable</p><p>computers and desktop
    computers. To accomplish this goal, this International Standard has reviewed ISO/IEC
    9995</p><p>and ISO 9241-4:1998 to identify those design features of these two
    base standards which are to be followed, which</p><p>are exempted from this International
    Standard and which are permitted variations.</p><p>This International Standard
    is intended primarily to apply to full size portable keyboards (e.g. A4). It may
    also apply</p><p>to other keyboards outside this scope. ISO 9241-4 contains a
    proposed alternative method for conformance by a</p><p>test based on user performance
    and subjective rating scales.</p><p>This International Standard consists of two
    major categories of guidelines for portable computers:</p><p>1. Layout characteristics</p><p>2.
    Physical (ergonomic) characteristics</p>"
