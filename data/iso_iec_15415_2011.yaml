abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15415:2011    specifies two methodologies for the measurement of
    specific attributes of two-dimensional bar code symbols, one of these being applicable
    to multi-row bar code symbologies and the other to two-dimensional matrix symbologies;   defines
    methods for evaluating and grading these measurements and deriving an overall
    assessment of symbol quality;   gives information on possible causes of deviation
    from optimum grades to assist users in taking appropriate corrective action.     ISO/IEC
    15415:2011 applies to those two-dimensional symbologies for which a reference
    decode algorithm has been defined, but its methodologies can be applied partially
    or wholly to other similar symbologies.  While ISO/IEC 15415:2011 can be applied
    to direct part marks, it is possible that better correlation between measurement
    results and scanning performance will be obtained with ISO/IEC TR 29158 in combination
    with ISO/IEC 15415:2011.
