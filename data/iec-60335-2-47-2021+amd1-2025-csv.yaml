  script: Latn
  content: "IEC 60335-2-47:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of electrically
    operated commercial boiling pans, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase and neutral, and 480
    V for other appliances. These appliances are not intended for household and similar
    purposes. They are used for commercial processing of food in areas not open to
    the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens, hospitals and in
    commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries. The electrical part of
    appliances making use of other forms of energy is also within the scope of this
    standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common
    hazards presented by these types of appliances.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to
    the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on
    board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n–
    in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national water supply authorities and similar authorities;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries additional requirements are specified for pressure appliances.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances designed exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– appliances for continuous mass production of
    food;<br />\r\n– battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels
    and replaces the fourth edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment
    2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes
    have been converted to normative text, modified or deleted (Clause 1, 7.15, 11.7,
    9.101, 10.1, 11.4, 11.7, 19.101, 20.1, 22.101, 22.113, 23.3, 27.2);<br />\r\nc)
    clarifications to some test specifications have been made (15.1.1, 15.2, 20.1,
    22.101, 22.102);<br />\r\nd) exclusion of battery-operated appliances and appliances
    used in areas open to the public (Clause 1);<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
