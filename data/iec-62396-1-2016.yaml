  content: "IEC 62396-1:2016(E) provides guidance on atmospheric radiation effects
    on avionics electronics used in aircraft operating at altitudes up to 60 000 ft
    (18,3 km). It defines the radiation environment, the effects of that environment
    on electronics and provides design considerations for the accommodation of those
    effects within avionics systems. This International Standard helps aerospace equipment
    manufacturers and designers to standardise their approach to single event effects
    in avionics by providing guidance, leading to a standard methodology. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- incorporation of references to some new papers and issues
    which have appeared since 2011;<br />\r\n- addition of solar flares and extreme
    space weather reference to a proposed future Part 6;<br />\r\n- addition of reference
    to a proposed new Part 7 on incorporating atmospheric radiation effects analysis
    into the system design process;<br />\r\n- addition of a reference to a proposed
    future Part 8 on other particles including protons, pions and muons."
