    <p>This document focuses on the abstract interface between an application and the data processor and includes the specification and definition of application commands and responses. It allows data and commands to be specified in a standardised way, independent of the ISO/IEC 18000 series air interfaces.</p>
    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>—    provides guidelines on presenting data as objects;</p>
    <p>—    defines the structure of Object Identifiers, based on ISO/IEC 9834-1;</p>
    <p>—    specifies the commands that are supported for transferring data between an application and the radio frequency identification (RFID) tag;</p>
    <p>—    specifies the responses that are supported for transferring data between the tag and the application;</p>
    <p>—    does not specify any required transfer syntax with ISO/IEC 15962, but provides the non-normative information in Annex A for backward compatibility with the 2004 version of this document (ISO/IEC 15961:2004[1]).</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>[1] Withdrawn standard. Replaced by ISO/IEC 15961-1, ISO/IEC 15961-2, ISO/IEC 15961-3 and ISO/IEC 15961-4.</p>
