abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 establishes the design format and data content of
    an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to the human-readable (visual)
    features and the placement of ISO machine-readable technologies on the card. It
    creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL
    without restricting individual domestic or regional driver licensing authorities
    from incorporating their specific needs on the IDL.The intent of the ID-1 sized
    IDL is to allow one document to serve the purpose of both what is currently known
    amongst driver licensing authorities as a domestic driving permit and an international
    driving permit (IDP). Thus the IDL replaces the need for two separate documents.
    Alternatively, those countries that choose to maintain their individual domestic
    design can issue a second card (with or without ISO machine-readable technologies),
    a domestic driving licence (DDL), whilst the IDL serves to replace the current
    IDP paper document only. ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 also specifies an explanatory booklet
    with sleeve insert pocket that may optionally accompany an IDL to facilitate its
    world wide interpretation when used instead of an IDP.The IDL comprises the following:minimum
    common mandatory data element set,common layout for ease of recognition,minimum
    set of security requirements.ISO/IEC 18013-1:2005 allows domestic or regional
    driver licensing authorities to exercise their own discretion in respect of the
    following aspects of the IDL in order to meet their specific needs:including supplementary
    optional data elements (in addition to the minimum common mandatory data element
    set);incorporating ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 machine-readable technologies including magnetic
    stripe, integrated circuit with contacts, contactless integrated circuit or optical
    memory technology, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional bar codes;incorporating
    current and future technologies (including biometrics, cryptography and data compression);adding
    physical document security elements (in addition to the mandatory elements).This
    new IDL design yields a document thatis more secure from counterfeiting and alteration
    than the IDP document;allows authorities to verify the authenticity of the document;integrates
    the personal data into a secure ID-1 size medium;allows more reliable identification
    of the licence holder;allows for machine-readable technologies;facilitates information
    exchange and mutual recognition among driver licensing authorities;allows an ISO/IEC
    18013-1:2005 compliant DDL to serve simultaneously as an IDL.
