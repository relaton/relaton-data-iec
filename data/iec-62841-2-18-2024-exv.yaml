    with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7448\">IEC 62841-1:2014</a>.
    This document supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 62841-1,
    so as to convert it into the IEC Standard: Particular requirements for hand-held
    strapping tools. Where a particular subclause of IEC 62841-1 is not mentioned
    in this document, that subclause applies as far as reasonable. Where this document
    states \"addition\", \"modification\" or \"replacement\", the relevant text in

    tools.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-11) has been included in
