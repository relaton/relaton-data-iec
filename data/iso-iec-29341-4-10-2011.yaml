  content: ISO/IEC 29341-4-10:2011(E) Describes the service type which enables control
    over the transport of audio and video streams. The service type defines a common
    model for A/V transport control suitable for a generic user interface. It can
    be used to control a wide variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices
    such as CD players, VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service
    can be used to control tuners. This service definition is compliant with the UPnP
    Device Architecture version 1.0. This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC
    29341-4-10, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision.
