abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23651:2003 specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge containing a memory chip to enable physical
    interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of
    the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format - called Advanced
    Intelligent Tape No. 3 (AIT-3 format) - thereby allowing data interchange between
    drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23651:2003 specifies
    two types of cartridge depending on the thickness of the magnetic tape contained
    in the case.</p><p>Information interchange between systems also requires, at a
    minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange code(s)
    and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the
    interchanged cartridge.</p>"
