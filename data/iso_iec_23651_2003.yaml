abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    23651:2003 specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide
    magnetic tape cartridge containing a memory chip to enable physical interchange
    of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the recording method and the recorded format - called Advanced Intelligent
    Tape No. 3 (AIT-3 format) - thereby allowing data interchange between drives by
    means of such magnetic tape cartridges.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 23651:2003 specifies
    two types of cartridge depending on the thickness of the magnetic tape contained
    in the case.<br />\r\nInformation interchange between systems also requires, at
    a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange code(s)
    and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the
    interchanged cartridge."
