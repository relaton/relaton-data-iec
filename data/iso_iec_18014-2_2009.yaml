abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18014-2:2009 presents a general framework for the provision
    of time-stamping services.</p><p>Time-stamping services may generate, renew and
    verify time-stamp tokens.</p><p>Time-stamp tokens are associations between data
    and points in time, and are created in a way that aims to provide evidence that
    the data existed at the associated date and time. In addition, the evidence may
    be used by non-repudiation services.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18014-2:2004 specifies mechanisms
    that generate independent time-stamps: in order to verify an independent time-stamp
    token, verifiers do not need access to any other time-stamp tokens. That is, time-stamp
    tokens are not linked, as is the case for the token types defined in ISO/IEC 18014-3.</p>"
