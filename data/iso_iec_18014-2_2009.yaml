abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 18014-2:2009 presents a general framework for the provision of
    time-stamping services.Time-stamping services may generate, renew and verify time-stamp
    tokens.Time-stamp tokens are associations between data and points in time, and
    are created in a way that aims to provide evidence that the data existed at the
    associated date and time. In addition, the evidence may be used by non-repudiation
    services.ISO/IEC 18014-2:2004 specifies mechanisms that generate independent time-stamps:
    in order to verify an independent time-stamp token, verifiers do not need access
    to any other time-stamp tokens. That is, time-stamp tokens are not linked, as
    is the case for the token types defined in ISO/IEC 18014-3.'
