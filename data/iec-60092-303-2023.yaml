  content: "IEC 60092-303:2023 is applicable to all transformers used for power and
    lighting and, where appropriate, to static convertors, starting transformers,
    static balancers, earthing transformers, saturable reactors and transductors for
    use in ships, including single-phase transformers rated higher than 1 kVA, and
    three-phase transformers rated higher than 5 kVA, unless special requirements
    are specified. This document applies to transformers with rated voltage up to
    and including 36 kV.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 1980 and Amendment 1:1997. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    environmental conditions,<br />\r\n- load harmonic currents,<br />\r\n- Transformers
    for special applications,<br />\r\n- design and construction,<br />\r\n- transformers
    for essentials services."
