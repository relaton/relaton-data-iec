  content: "IEC 62387:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62387:2020
    applies to all kinds of passive dosimetry systems that are used for measuring:<br
    />\r\n- the personal dose equivalent Hp(10) (for individual whole body monitoring),<br
    />\r\n- the personal dose equivalent Hp(3) (for individual eye lens monitoring),<br
    />\r\n- the personal dose equivalent Hp(0,07) (for both individual whole body
    skin and local skin for extremity monitoring),<br />\r\n- the ambient dose equivalent
    H*(10) (for workplace and environmental monitoring),<br />\r\n- the directional
    dose equivalent H'(3) (for workplace and environmental monitoring), or<br />\r\n-
    the directional dose equivalent H'(0,07) (for workplace and environmental monitoring).<br
    />\r\nThis document applies to dosimetry systems that measure external photon
    and/or beta radiation in the dose range between 0,01 mSv and 10 Sv and in the
    energy ranges given in Table 1. All the energy values are mean energies with respect
    to the fluence. The dosimetry systems usually use electronic devices for the data
    evaluation and thus are often computer controlled."
