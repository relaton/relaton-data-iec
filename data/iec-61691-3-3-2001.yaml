  content: This standard supports the synthesis and verification of hardware designs,
    by defining vector types for representing signed or unsigned integer values and
    providing standard interpretations of widely used scalar VHDL values. Includes
    package bodies, as described in annex A, which are available in electronic format
    either on a diskette affixed to the back cover, or as a downloadable file from
    the IEC Web Store.
