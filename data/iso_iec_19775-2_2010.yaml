abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19775 defines a software system that integrates network-enabled
    3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based
    space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified
    through a variety of mechanisms.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 19775-2:2010 specifies
    a standard set of services that are made available by a browser so that an author
    can access the scene graph while it is running. Such access is designed to support
    interaction with, and modification of, the scene graph."
