  content: "IEC 62282-3-100:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 62282-3-100:2019
    applies to stationary packaged, self-contained fuel cell power systems or fuel
    cell power systems comprised of factory matched packages of integrated systems
    which generate electricity through electrochemical reactions. This document is
    applicable to stationary fuel cell power systems intended for indoor and outdoor
    commercial, industrial and residential use in non-hazardous areas. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) recognition that fuel carrying components qualified to leakage
    standards (soundness) need not be considered as potential flammable leak sources;<br
    />\r\nb) new annex for small power systems; and<br />\r\nc) clarifications for
    numerous requirements and tests</p>"
