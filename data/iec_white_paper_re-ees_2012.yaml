abstract:
- content: "The proportion of Renewable Energies is likely to increase in all major
    electricity markets. Their large scale incorporation into existing electricity
    grids will be complex, and their successful integration will likely depend on
    large-capacity Electrical Energy Storage.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paperâ€™s primary
    goal is to provide a global view on the state of the art and future directions
    for grid integration of large-capacity Renewable Energy sources and the application
    of large-capacity Energy Storage for that purpose. It identifies challenges for
    grid operators and producers of electricity, and provides insights into current
    and potential methods for addressing these difficulties. The White Paper aims
    to support grid integration efforts around the world by providing guidance to
    the electric utility industry, policy makers and the IEC standardization and conformity
    assessment community.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper was developed with CTOs
    (Chief Technology Officers) of major technology companies who participate in the
    \ IEC MSB  (Market Strategy Board) in cooperation with RASEI (the Renewable and
    Sustainable Energy Institute) at NIST (the US National Institute of Science and
    Technology) and the University of Colorado at Boulder, and SGCC (State Grid Corporation
    of China).<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for  free download."
