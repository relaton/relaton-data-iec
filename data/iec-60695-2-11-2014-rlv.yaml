  content: "IEC 60695-2-11:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60695-2-11:2014 specifies
    a test method on an end product. It is intended to simulate the effects of thermal
    stresses produced by an electrically heated source to represent a fire hazard.
    This test method is used to check that, under defined test conditions, an end
    product exposed to an electrically heated source has either a limited ability
    to ignite or, if it ignites, a limited ability to propagate flame. However, the
    fire hazard analysis, the flammability aspects and the flame spreading to other
    products are not covered by the present standard. This second edition of IEC 60695-2-11
    cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 60695-2-11 published in 2000. It
    constitutes a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous
    edition are:<br />\r\n- the Introduction has been added to provide background
    and how it relates to the Scope,<br />\r\n- the Scope has been modified for greater
    clarity and reference to basic safety publications,<br />\r\n- numerous terms
    and definitions relevant to this Standard have been added to Clause 3,<br />\r\n-
    the application of \"small parts\" and \"insignificant mass\" have been introduced
    and clarified,<br />\r\n- the different types of specimens, how to specify them,
    and limitations of the test method have been further clarified in Clause 4,<br
    />\r\n- clarified in Clause 5 the distance to specified layer when unknown,<br
    />\r\n- the information from Clause 6 has been moved into the test procedure in
    Clause 8,<br />\r\n- the conditioning of the specified layer and the laboratory
    ambient test conditions were clarified in Clause 7,<br />\r\n- measurement of
    the maximum flame height was removed from Clause 9,<br />\r\n- the reference to
    this test as \"GWEPT\" was introduced along with an applicable title change and<br
    />\r\n- Annex A has been revised to reflect current practice by prominent product
    committees.<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/47829\">
    IEC 60695-2-10:2013</a>."
