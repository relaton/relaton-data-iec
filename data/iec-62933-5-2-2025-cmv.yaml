  content: "IEC 62933-5-2:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62933-5-2:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62933-5-2:2020
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 120 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62933-5-2:2025 primarily describes safety aspects for people
    and, where appropriate, safety matters related to the surroundings and living
    beings for grid-connected energy storage systems where an electrochemical storage
    subsystem is used. This document is applicable to the entire life cycle of BESS
    (from design to end of service life management). This document provides further
    safety provisions that arise due to the use of an electrochemical storage subsystem
    (e.g. battery system) in EES systems that are beyond the general safety considerations
    described in IEC 62933-5-1. This document specifies the safety requirements of
    an \"electrochemical\" energy storage system as a \"system\" to reduce the risk
    of harm or damage caused by the hazards of an electrochemical energy storage system
    due to interactions between the subsystems as presently understood."
