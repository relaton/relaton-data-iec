abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13818-1:2015 specifies the system layer of the coding. It was
    developed principally to support the combination of the video and audio coding
    methods defined in Parts 2 and 3 of ISO/IEC 13818. The system layer supports six
    basic functions:</p><p>1) the synchronization of multiple compressed streams on
    decoding;</p><p>2) the interleaving of multiple compressed streams into a single
    stream;</p><p>3) the initialization of buffering for decoding start up;</p><p>4)
    continuous buffer management;</p><p>5) time identification;</p><p>6) multiplexing
    and signalling of various components in a system stream.</p><p>A Rec. ITU-T H.222.0
    | ISO/IEC 13818-1 multiplexed bit stream is either a transport stream or a program
    stream. Both streams are constructed from PES packets and packets containing other
    necessary information. Both stream types support multiplexing of video and audio
    compressed streams from one program with a common time base. The transport stream
    additionally supports the multiplexing of video and audio compressed streams from
    multiple programs with independent time bases. For almost error-free environments
    the program stream is generally more appropriate, supporting software processing
    of program information. The transport stream is more suitable for use in environments
    where errors are likely.</p><p>A Rec. ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 multiplexed
    bit stream, whether a transport stream or a program stream, is constructed in
    two layers: the outermost layer is the system layer, and the innermost is the
    compression layer. The system layer provides the functions necessary for using
    one or more compressed data streams in a system. The video and audio parts of
    this Specification define the compression coding layer for audio and video data.
    Coding of other types of data is not defined by this Specification, but is supported
    by the system layer provided that the other types of data adhere to the constraints
    defined in 2.7.</p>"
