abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23001-4:2009 defines the methods and general principles capable
    of describing codec configurations in the so-called reconfigurable video-coding
    (RVC) framework. It primarily addresses reconfigurable video aspects and will
    only focus on the description of representation for video codec configurations
    within the RVC framework.   Within the scope of RVC framework, two languages,
    namely FNL and RVC-BSDL, are specified normatively. FNL is a language that describes
    the FND, also known as “network of FUs”. RVC-BSDL is a pertinent subset of BSDL
    defined in ISO/IEC 23001-5. This RVC-BSDL also includes possibilities for further
    extensions, which are necessary to provide complete description of video bitstreams.
