    60079-18:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard and its
    Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and provides
    you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the official
    IEC Standard and its previous edition.</span><br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:#000000;
    font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif\">IEC 60079-18:2014 gives the specific
    requirements for the construction, testing and marking of electrical equipment,
    parts of electrical equipment and Ex components with the type of protection encapsulation
    \"m\" intended for use in explosive gas atmospheres or explosive dust atmospheres.
    This part applies only for encapsulated electrical equipment, encapsulated parts
    of electrical equipment and encapsulated Ex components (hereinafter always referred
    to as \"m\" equipment) where the rated voltage does not exceed 11 kV. The application
    of electrical equipment in atmospheres, which may contain explosive gas as well
    as combustible dust simultaneously, may require additional protective measures.
    This standard does not apply to dusts of explosives, which do not require atmospheric
    oxygen for combustion, or to pyrophoric substances. This standard does not take
    account of any risk due to an emission of flammable or toxic gas from the dust.
    This standard supplements and modifies the general requirements of IEC 60079-0.
    Where a requirement of this standard conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0,
    the requirement of this standard takes precedence. This International Standard
    is to be used in conjunction with IEC 60079-0, Explosive atmospheres - Part 0:
    Equipment-General requirements. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition of IEC 60079-18:2009, and constitutes a technical revision. Please refer
    to the foreword of the document for a listing of the technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition.<br />\r\nKeywords: encapsulation \"m\", explosive gas
    atmospheres, explosive dust atmospheres<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of July 2018 have been included in this copy.</span>"
