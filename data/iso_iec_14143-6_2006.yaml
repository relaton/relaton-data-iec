abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14143-6:2006 provides a summary of the FSM (Functional Size Measurement)
    related International Standards and the relationship between;    the ISO/IEC 14143
    series FSM framework International Standards that provide the definitions and
    concepts of FSM and conformance and verification of FSMMs (Functional Size Measurement
    Methods), and   the ISO/IEC standard FSMMs, i.e. ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926,
    ISO/IEC 20968 and ISO/IEC 24570.     An FSMM is a software sizing method that
    conforms to the mandatory requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1.    ISO/IEC 14143-6
    also provides a process to assist users to select an FSMM that meets their requirements.
    It also gives guidance on how to use Functional Size (FS).    FSMMs include, but
    are not limited to, ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926, ISO/IEC 20968 and ISO/IEC 24570,
    as well.    Recommending a specific FSMM is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 14143-6.
