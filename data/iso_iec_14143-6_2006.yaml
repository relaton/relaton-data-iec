    Measurement) related International Standards and the relationship between;</p><ul><li>the
    ISO/IEC 14143 series FSM framework International Standards that provide the definitions
    and concepts of FSM and conformance and verification of FSMMs (Functional Size
    Measurement Methods), and</li><li>the ISO/IEC standard FSMMs, i.e. ISO/IEC 19761,
    ISO/IEC 20926, ISO/IEC 20968 and ISO/IEC 24570.</li></ul><p>An FSMM is a software
    sizing method that conforms to the mandatory requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    14143-6 also provides a process to assist users to select an FSMM that meets their
    requirements. It also gives guidance on how to use Functional Size (FS).</p><p>FSMMs
    include, but are not limited to, ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926, ISO/IEC 20968 and
    ISO/IEC 24570, as well.</p><p>Recommending a specific FSMM is outside the scope
