abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 11017:1998 This Technical Report presents the framework and recommended model
    for internationalization and identifies the Services required for the internationalization
    of information technology.<br />\r\nThis Technical Report:<br />\r\n- discusses
    the requirements of internationalized Systems and their users,<br />\r\n- suggests
    a concerted, unified approach to internationalization,<br />\r\n- recommends Services
    to fulfil the requirements, and lists the Standards related to the Services.<br
    />\r\nThis Technical Report is intended to be a reference for future Standards
    on the internationalization of information technology, to act as a communication
    vehicle between those who provide Standards and those who request them, and also
    to function as a basis for all future ISO/IEC JTC l/SC 22NVG 20 activities.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 This Technical Report does not propose any specific solutions for
    internationalization. Future Standards are expected to provide the solutions,
    reflecting the directions in this Technical Report.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Internationalization
    Services consist of internationally generic Services and nationally specific information
    (data). This Technical Report covers only the internationally generic Portion
    of Software, so it does not discuss: - preparation of internationalized information
    technology Systems for localization by a local User. - hardware-related issues
    or requirements. - requirements related to System ergonomics.<br />\r\nNOTE 3
    The internationalization solutions and Services available in the mid-late 1980s
    are the technical basis for this Technical Report."
