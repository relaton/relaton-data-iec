abstract:
- content: "<p>This Technical Report presents the framework and recommended model
    for internationalization and identifies the Services required for the internationalization
    of information technology.</p><p>This Technical Report:</p><p>- discusses the
    requirements of internationalized Systems and their users,</p><p>- suggests a
    concerted, unified approach to internationalization,</p><p>- recommends Services
    to fulfil the requirements, and lists the Standards related to the Services.</p><p>This
    Technical Report is intended to be a reference for future Standards on the internationalization
    of information technology, to act as a communication vehicle between those who
    provide Standards and those who request them, and also to function as a basis
    for all future ISO/IEC JTC l/SC 22NVG 20 activities.</p><p>NOTE 1 This Technical
    Report does not propose any specific solutions for internationalization. Future
    Standards are expected to provide the solutions, reflecting the directions in
    this Technical Report.</p><p>NOTE 2 Internationalization Services consist of internationally
    generic Services and nationally specific information (data). This Technical Report
    covers only the internationally generic Portion of Software, so it does not discuss:
    - preparation of internationalized information technology Systems for localization
    by a local User. - hardware-related issues or requirements. - requirements related
    to System ergonomics.</p><p> NOTE 3 The internationalization solutions and Services
    available in the mid-late 1980s are the technical basis for this Technical Report.</p>"
