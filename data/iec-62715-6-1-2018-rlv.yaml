  content: "IEC 62715-6-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 62715-6-1:2018
    defines the standard test methods to evaluate the mechanical stability of flexible
    display modules, specifically mechanical stability against deformation, such as
    bending, rolling, twisting, and stretching. Display modules include displays such
    as LCD, e-paper, and OLED. This document takes into account, wherever possible,
    the mechanical test methods outlined under mechanical stress. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) changed the part title
    to differentiate it from other parts;<br />\r\nb) added new bending testing methods;<br
    />\r\nc) added detailed testing procedures.</p>"
