  content: "IEC TS 62073:2016(E) specifies the measurement of the hydrophobicity of
    the shed and housing material of composite insulators for overhead lines, substations
    and equipment or ceramic insulators covered or not covered by a coating. The obtained
    value represents the hydrophobicity at the time of the measurement. The object
    of this technical specification is to describe three methods that can be used
    to determine the hydrophobicity of insulators. The determination of the ability
    of water to wet the surface of insulators may be useful to evaluate the condition
    of the surface of insulators in service, or as part of the insulator testing in
    the laboratory. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Changed wettability to hydrophobicity throughout the document<br />\r\nb)
    Redefined the criteria for the determination of hydrophobicity class in paragraph
    3.4."
