  content: Applies to newly manufactured current transformers for use with electrical
    measuring instruments and electrical protective devices at frequencies from 15
    Hz to 100 Hz. Although the requirements relate basically to transformers with
    separate windings they are also applicable, where appropriate, to auto-transformers.
