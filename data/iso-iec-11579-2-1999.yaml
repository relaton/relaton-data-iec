    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 11579 specifies a reference configuration (RC) for high-speed private integrated services</p>
    <p>network exchanges (HS-PINX), for their interconnection to form high-speed private integrated services networks</p>
    <p>(HS-PISN). The configuration is intended to provide guidance for the specification of PINX capabilities, but does not</p>
    <p>impose any specific implementation of a HS-PINX.</p>
    <p>This RC describes a conceptual HS-PINX. By combining multiple HS-PINXs to a high-speed private integrated</p>
    <p>services network the RC becomes applicable to a HS-PISN. This is generically described in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p>
    <p>This RC satisfies the support of all HS applications, such as LAN, MAN, B-ISDN, etc.</p>
