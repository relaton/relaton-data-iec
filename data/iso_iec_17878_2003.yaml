abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 17878:2003 specifies the
    signalling protocol for the support of the Private User Mobility call handling
    additional network features (ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO) at the Q reference point between
    Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together within
    a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>ANF-PUMI is a feature that
    directs incoming calls to a PUM user within the PISN regardless of the PUM user's
    geographical location within the PISN, provided that the PUM user's location is
    known.</p><p>ANF-PUMO permits the PISN to process call requests from a PUM user
    at the home location, if required.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three stages and according
    to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. ISO/IEC 17878:2003 contains the stage
    3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified
    by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 17877.</p><p>The signalling
    protocol for ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO operates on top of the signalling protocol
    for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses
    certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services
    specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17878:2003 also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between ANF-PUMI/ANF-PUMO and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    17878:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>
