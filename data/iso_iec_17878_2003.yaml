abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17878:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Private User Mobility call handling additional network features (ANF-PUMI
    and ANF-PUMO) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN).</p><p>ANF-PUMI is a feature that directs incoming calls to a PUM user
    within the PISN regardless of the PUM user's geographical location within the
    PISN, provided that the PUM user's location is known.</p><p>ANF-PUMO permits the
    PISN to process call requests from a PUM user at the home location, if required.</p><p>The
    Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec.
    I.130. ISO/IEC 17878:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 17877.</p><p>The signalling protocol for ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO operates
    on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as
    specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures
    for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    17878:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the
    support of interactions at the Q reference point between ANF-PUMI/ANF-PUMO and
    other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17878:2003 is applicable
    to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
