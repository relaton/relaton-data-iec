abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    17878:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Private User
    Mobility call handling additional network features (ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO) at
    the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX)
    connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nANF-PUMI
    is a feature that directs incoming calls to a PUM user within the PISN regardless
    of the PUM user's geographical location within the PISN, provided that the PUM
    user's location is known.<br />\r\nANF-PUMO permits the PISN to process call requests
    from a PUM user at the home location, if required.<br />\r\nThe Q reference point
    is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced in
    three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. ISO/IEC
    17878:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    17877.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO operates on
    top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified
    in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control
    of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 17878:2003
    also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of
    interactions at the Q reference point between ANF-PUMI/ANF-PUMO and other supplementary
    services and ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 17878:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can
    interconnect to form a PISN."
