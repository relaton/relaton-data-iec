abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 23006-2:2016 specifies a set of Application Programming Interfaces
    (called for short MXM APIs) so that MPEG-M Applications running on an MPEG-M Device
    can access the standard multimedia technologies contained in its Middleware as
    MPEG-M Engines, as specified by ISO/IEC 23006‑1.</p><p>The MXM APIs belong to
    two classes:</p><p>- the MPEG-M Engine APIs, i.e. the collection of the individual
    MPEG-M Engine APIs providing access to a single MPEG technology (e.g. video coding)
    or to a group of MPEG technologies where this is convenient;</p><p>- the MPEG-M
    Orchestrator API, i.e. the API of the special MPEG-M Engine (called Orchestrator
    Engine) that is capable of creating chains of MPEG-M Engines to execute high-level
    application calls such as "Play a video", as opposed to the typically low-level
    MPEG-M Engine API calls.</p>
