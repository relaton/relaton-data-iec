abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 14543-5-102:2020(E) specifies the system architecture and
    communication protocols of remote universal management profile to achieve intelligent
    grouping, resource sharing and service collaboration among different devices and
    controllers. The protocol features are:\r\na) remote universal device discovery
    and management framework that includes connection methods and network architecture,
    device configuration interfaces, management message formats and message exchange
    flows;\r\nb) request&#x2F;response message formats for four remote universal management
    profile device types: water heater, refrigerator, air conditioner, microwave.\r\nThis
    document is applicable to remote access of water heaters, refrigerators, air conditioners,
    microwave ovens at home, office or other remote environments, to achieve universal
    management and interactions among these controllers and devices"
