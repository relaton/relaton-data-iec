abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62786-100:2026 gives guidance for the drafting of IEC publications
    which relate, wholly or partly, to connection of distributed energy resources
    (DER) with the grid. Technical committees relevant to the connection of DER with
    grid are advised to follow the guidance given in this document when they prepare
    new publications and clauses relevant to the connection of DER with the grid,
    as well as when they revise existing publications so that consistent and harmonized
    standards can be delivered. Annex A, Annex B, Annex C, and Annex D list documents
    relevant to grid connection of DER in order to ensure that other IEC publications
    are consistent with these documents and to avoid overlapping each other.<br />\r\nTable
    E.1 lists national and regional standards and regulations relevant to connecting
    DER with the grid."
