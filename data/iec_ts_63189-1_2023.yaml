abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63189-1:2023 covers the terms and definitions, system composition
    and control modes of virtual power plant (VPP). It defines the functional requirements
    for VPPs, including power generation forecasting, load forecasting, generation
    and consumption scheduling, control and management of energy storage devices and
    loads, coordinated optimization of distributed energy resources, status monitoring
    and communication, data collection and analysis, and market transactions.<br />\r\nSince
    a virtual power plant is a cluster of dispersed energy converting installations,
    which are aggregated, it uses additional systems to achieve its objectives (e.g.
    regional energy meteorology forecasting, site specific energy management systems,
    SCADA and other communication systems).<br />\r\nLocal regulations, the electricity
    market model and the corresponding manner of organising the market related to
    the utilisation of controllable DER affect the management, control and operation
    of VPPs."
