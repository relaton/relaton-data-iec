abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 establishes specifications for tagging software to
    optimize its identification and management.It applies to:Platform providers: These
    are the entities which are responsible for the computer or hardware device and/or
    associated operating system, or virtual environment, on which software can be
    installed or run. Platform providers which support ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 additionally
    provide tag management capabilities at the level of the platform or operating
    system.Software providers: These are the entities that create (“software creators”),
    package (“software packagers”) or license (“software licensors”) software for
    distribution or installation. These include software manufacturers, independent
    software developers, consultants, and repackagers of previously manufactured software.
    They may also be in-house software developers.Tag providers: These are the entities
    that create (“tag creators”) or modify (“tag modifiers”) software identification
    tags. A tag provider may be part of the software provider organization, or may
    be a 3rd party organization or the software consumer.Tag tool providers: These
    are the entities that may provide any number of tools that create, modify or use
    software identification tags. These tools include development environments that
    provide automatically generated software identification tags, installation tools
    that may create and/or modify tags on behalf of the installation process as well
    as desktop management tools that may create tags for software that does not have
    a tag and/or modify tags with release details throughout the software lifecycle.Software
    consumers: These are the entities that purchase, install and/or otherwise consume
    software, and who are intended as the one of the major beneficiaries of the improved
    information provided by the software identification tag as specified in ISO/IEC
    19770-2:2009.ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009 does not detail SAM processes required for reconciliation
    of software entitlements with software identification tags.It does not specify
    product activation or launch controls.It is not intended to conflict either with
    any organization''s policies, procedures and standards or with any national laws
    and regulations. Any such conflict should be resolved before using ISO/IEC 19770-2:2009.'
