abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62829-1:2019, which is a Technical Report, covers<br />\r\n• a
    study into the pre-requisites of chemometric (exploratory) data analysis,<br />\r\n•
    an overview of common data analysis procedures for univariate, bivariate and multivariate
    data analysis,<br />\r\n• explanations of the basic principles and major application
    areas of the different methods),<br />\r\n• some recommendations on the selection
    of an appropriate data analysis strategy.<br />\r\nThese recommendations not covered
    earlier by other guidance documents on the topic are complemented by some advice
    on the validation of commercial (at the site of installation) and tailored software
    for process analytical purposes. Recommendations are given on available reference
    data sets (Annex B) for benchmarking of software implementing the data analysis
    methods covered (if available)."
