  content: "IEC 61850-5:2013+AMD1:2022 applies to power utility automation systems
    with the core part of substation automation systems (SAS); it standardizes the
    communication between intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) and defines the related
    system requirements to be supported. The major technical changes with regard to
    the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- extension from substation automation
    systems to utility automation systems;<br />\r\n- inclusion of interfaces for
    communication between substations;<br />\r\n- requirements from communication
    beyond the boundary of the substation."
