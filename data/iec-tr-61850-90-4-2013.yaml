  content: IEC/TR 61850-90-4:2013(E) is intended for an audience familiar with network
    communication and/or IEC 61850-based systems and particularly for substation protection
    and control equipment vendors, network equipment vendors and system integrators.
    This Technical Report focuses on engineering a local area network limited to the
    requirements of IEC 61850-based substation automation. It outlines the advantages
    and disadvantages of different approaches to network topology, redundancy, clock
    synchronization, etc. so that the network designer can make educated decisions.
    In addition, this report outlines possible improvements to both substation automation
    and networking equipment. This Technical Report addresses the most critical aspects
    of IEC 61850, such as protection related to tripping over the network. This Technical
    Report addresses in particular the multicast data transfer of large volumes of
    sampled values from merging units. It also considers the high precision clock
    synchronization and "seamless" guaranteed transport of data across the network
    under failure conditions that is central to the process bus concept.
