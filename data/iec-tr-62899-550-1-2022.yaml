  content: "IEC TR 62899-550-1:2022(E), which is a Technical Report, provides a framework
    for evaluating the mechanical and thermal durability of printed and/or flexible
    electronics components and products. This includes the bending test, torsion test,
    stretching test, steady heat test as well as the thermal cycle test. These are
    typical conditions that are easily encountered in daily life for printed and/or
    flexible electronics components and products.<br />\r\nThis document gives guidance
    for use for technical committees in the preparation of consistent standards relating
    to the quality assessment of printed and/or flexible electronics components and
    products. Consistent standards for durability testing will help users, including
    businesses, developers, vendors, and end users to select suitable methods for
    durability testing and make consistent test procedures for printed electronics."
