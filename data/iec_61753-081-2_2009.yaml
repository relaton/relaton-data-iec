abstract:
- content: IEC 61753-081-2:2009(E) contains the minimum initial test and measurement
    requirements and severities which a fibre optic middle-scale 1 x N (16 ≤ N ≤ 64)
    DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing) device with channel spacing of 50
    GHz, 100 GHz and 200 GHz needs to satisfy in order to be categorized as meeting
    the requirements of category C-controlled environments. The requirements cover
    devices with single-mode non-connectorized pigtails and no circuit board. There
    is also a distinction between small-scale (N< 16) and large-scale (N > 64) 1 x
    N DWDM devices for the purpose of this standard.
