abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62926:2019 provides guidelines for safe integration and operation
    of an adaptive external-beam RADIOTHERAPY system (AEBRS) for intra-fractionally
    moving rigid TARGET VOLUMEs, where required equipment can be sourced from one
    or several MANUFACTURERs. In particular it addresses guidelines to help ensure
    safe integration and operation for the PATIENT, OPERATOR, other persons and sensitive
    devices in the vicinity. In this document, the word “system” is hereafter used
    to refer to an AEBRS.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the safety guidelines for
    a MANUFACTURER or RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION who integrates the AEBRS for intra-fractionally
    moving rigid TARGET VOLUMEs. If a RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION integrates an AEBRS,
    then it takes the role of MANUFACTURER and will be referred to as a MANUFACTURER
    throughout this document.<br />\r\nThis document includes reference models of
    the AEBRS for intra-fractionally moving rigid TARGET VOLUMEs and HAZARDs which,
    at a minimum, are considered during the RISK ANALYSIS.<br />\r\nAlthough TARGET
    VOLUMES and OARs can deform during motion, adaptations in response to deformations
    of the TARGET VOLUME are out of the scope of this document. The scope is limited
    to rigid TARGET VOLUMEs exhibiting intra-fractional movements, both translational
    and rotational. While technical HAZARDs are discussed in this document, the RESPONSIBLE
    ORGANIZATION is reminded that clinical judgement is always employed when determining
    clinical usability and reviewing TREATMENT PARAMETER changes.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not specifically address HAZARD mitigations for each of the HAZARDs mentioned
    in the document; however, some mitigations are given as examples in Clauses 4
    and 5. All guidelines in this document are intended to be implemented in accordance
    with the general standard IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012, with
    special attention to 4.2 of IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012."
