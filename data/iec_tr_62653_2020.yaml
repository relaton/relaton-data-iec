abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 62653:2020 is available as IEC TR 62653:2020 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    TR 62653:2020 describes the technical recommendations for use of medical equipment
    in chronic Haemodialysis, Haemofiltration and Haemodiafiltration. These principles
    are important to be complied with to ensure safe, permissible and appropriate
    application. The term Haemodialysis is used in this document as synonym for all
    therapy modalities.<br />\r\nThe scope can be applicable to the use of the medical
    equipment in home, acute and pediatrics environment. The scope may also be applicable
    to Sorbent Dialysis Systems.<br />\r\nThe physician is responsible for the treatment
    prescription. However, the Organization administering the treatment is responsible
    for all resources, structures and processes used in connection with the treatment.
    These responsibilities will not be described here. The requirements of IEC 60601-2-16
    ensure that medical electrical equipment used for extracorporeal renal replacement
    therapy operates with a high level of safety. Despite that high level of safety,
    however, some residual risk remains, related to medical-biological, physical-chemical
    and technical Hazards. The Organization administering the treatment is responsible
    for managing the residual risk. This document is not intended to be used as the
    basis of regulatory inspection or certification assessment activities. IEC TR
    62653:2020 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update the
    relevant references to the new numbering scheme of the ISO 23500 family;<br />\r\nb)
    alignment with IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012, IEC 62353:2014
    and 60601-2-16:2018;<br />\r\nc) technical additions in several sections."
