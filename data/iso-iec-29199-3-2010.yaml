    <p>ISO/IEC 29199-3:2010 specifies the use of JPEG XR coding for timed sequences of images (motion sequences) within files based on the ISO base media file format (ISO/IEC 15444-12).</p>
    <p>The Motion JPEG XR file format is designed to contain one or more motion sequences of JPEG XR images, with their timing. It is intended as a ‘building block', specifying only the video format. An application would be expected to combine Motion JPEG XR with suitable audio, metadata, etc. for a complete application specification; that specification would normally select profiles and levels of Motion JPEG XR, and could also specify application profiles and levels that apply to the integration. </p>
    <p>Motion JPEG XR is expected to be used in a variety of applications, particularly where JPEG XR coding technology is already available for other reasons, or where the high-quality frame-based approach, with no inter-frame coding, is appropriate. </p>
    <p>Motion JPEG XR is a flexible format, permitting a wide variety of usages, such as editing, display, interchange, and streaming.</p>
