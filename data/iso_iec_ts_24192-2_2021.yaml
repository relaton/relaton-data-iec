abstract:
- content: "This document lists all the test conditions to be performed on a PT reader
    or a PT object in order to ensure that all the requirements specified in ISO/IEC
    TS 24192-1 are met for the PT device under test.<br />\r\nThis document applies
    to PT devices only:<br />\r\n- PT readers which are contactless fare management
    system terminals acting as a PCD contactless reader based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all
    parts);<br />\r\n- PT objects which are contactless fare media acting as a PICC
    contactless object based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts).<br />\r\nThis document
    applies solely to the contactless communication layers described in ISO/IEC 14443
    (all parts). Application-to-application exchanges executed once contactless communication
    has been established at RF level fall outside the scope of this document. However,
    a test application is used to make end-to-end transactions during tests on the
    RF communication layer.<br />\r\nThis document does not duplicate the contents
    of ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts) or ISO/IEC 10373-\x80\x916. It makes reference to
    the ISO/IEC 10373-\x80\x916 applicable test methods, specifies the test conditions
    to be used and describes the additional specific test conditions that can be run."
