abstract:
- content: The SCSI command set is designed to provide efficient peer-to-peer operation
    of input&#x2F;output devices (disks, tapes, printers, etc.) by an operating system.
    The SCSI command set assumes a command-response protocol. Action on SCSI commands
    shall not be deemed completed until a response is received. The response shall
    include a status that indicates the final disposition of the command. The SCSI
    command set provides multiple operating systems concurrent control over one or
    more input&#x2F;output devices. However, the multiple operating systems must properly
    coordinate their actions or data corruption will result. This standard specifies
    functional requirements for SCSI-3 Stream commands (SSC). SSC permits SCSI streaming
    devices such as tape and printer devices to attach to computers and provides the
    definitions for their use. This standard specifies the external behavior of a
    device server that defines itself as either a Sequential-access device or a Printer
    device; together, these device types are known as Stream Devices. The SSC standard
    conforms to SCSI-3 Architectural Model (ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-411:1999) standard.
