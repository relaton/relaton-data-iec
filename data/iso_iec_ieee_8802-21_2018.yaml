abstract:
- content: "<p>Abstract: An extensible IEEE 802Â® media access independent services
    framework (i.e., function and protocol) is defined that enables the optimization
    of services including handover and other services when performed between heterogeneous
    IEEE 802 networks. These services are facilitated by this standard when networking
    between IEEE 802 networks and cellular networks.</p>"
