abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 22237-5:2018 addresses the physical security of data centres
    based upon the criteria and classifications for \"availability\", \"security\"
    and \"energy efficiency enablement\" within ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 22237-5:2018 provides designations for the data centre spaces defined in ISO/IEC
    TS 22237‑1.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 22237-5:2018 specifies requirements and recommendations
    for those data centre spaces, and the systems employed within those spaces, in
    relation to protection against:<br />\r\na) unauthorized access addressing constructional,
    organizational and technological solutions;<br />\r\nb) fire events igniting within
    data centre spaces;<br />\r\nc) other events within or outside the data centre
    spaces, which would affect the defined level of protection.<br />\r\nSafety and
    electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this
    document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information
    given in this document may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations."
