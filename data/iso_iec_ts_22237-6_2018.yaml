- content: <p>This document addresses the physical security of data centres based
    upon the criteria and classifications for "availability", "security" and "energy
    efficiency enablement" within ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1.</p><p>This document provides
    designations for the data centre spaces defined in ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1.</p><p>This
    document specifies requirements and recommendations for those data centre spaces,
    and the systems employed within those spaces, in relation to protection against:</p><p>a)
    unauthorized access addressing constructional, organizational and technological
    solutions;</p><p>b) fire events igniting within data centre spaces;</p><p>c) other
    events within or outside the data centre spaces, which would affect the defined
    level of protection.</p><p>Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements
    are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and
