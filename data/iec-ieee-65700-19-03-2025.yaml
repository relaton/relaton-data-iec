  content: "<p>IEC/IEEE 65700-19-03:2025 applies to outdoor and indoor bushings of
    any voltage used on DC systems, of capacitance graded or gas insulated types for
    use as components of liquid-filled converter transformers and smoothing reactors,
    as well as air-to-air DC bushings. It applies to both line commutated converter
    (LCC), as well as voltage source converter (VSC) technologies. This document does
    not apply to the following:<br />\r\n- cable terminations (potheads);<br />\r\n-
    bushings for instrument transformers;<br />\r\n- bushings for test power supplies;<br
    />\r\n- bushings applied with gaseous insulation (other than air at atmospheric
    pressure) external to the bushing;<br />\r\n- bushings for industrial application;<br
    />\r\n- bushings for traction application;<br />\r\n- bushings for distribution
    class transformers.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision and includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- service experiences as well as established market requirements have been
    harmonized with existing IEC and IEEE standards, primarily IEC 60137, Insulated
    bushings for alternating voltages above 1 000 V, and IEEE Std C57.19.00™, IEEE
    Standard General Requirements and Test Procedures for Outdoor Power Apparatus
    Bushings;<br />\r\n- inclusion of voltage source converter (VSC) technologies.</p>"
