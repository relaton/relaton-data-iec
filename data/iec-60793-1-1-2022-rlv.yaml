  content: "IEC 60793-1-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-1:2022
    lists and gives guidance on the use of documents giving uniform requirements for
    measuring and testing optical fibres, thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres
    and cables for commercial (mostly telecommunications) purposes. The individual
    measurement and test methods are contained in the different parts of the IEC 60793
    series. They are identified as IEC 60793-1-X, where \"X\" is an assigned sub-part
    number, indicating its affiliation to the IEC 60793-1 series. In general, measurements
    and tests methods apply to all class A multimode fibres and class B and class
    C single-mode optical fibres covered by the IEC 60793-2 series relating to product
    specifications, although there can be exceptions. Clause 1 of each part of the
    IEC 60793 series contains the scope for each particular attribute. This fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- changes in
    normative references;<br />\r\n- renamed Clause 10 and added documentation-related
    requirements in a new subclause 10.2."
