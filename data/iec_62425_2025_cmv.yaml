abstract:
- content: "IEC 62425:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62425:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62425:2007
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 9 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62425:2025 is applicable to safety-related electronic systems
    (including subsystems and equipment) for railway signalling applications. This
    document applies to generic systems (i.e. generic products or systems defining
    a class of applications), as well as to systems for specific applications. The
    scope of this document, and its relationship with other IEC and CENELEC standards,
    are shown in Figure 1. This document is applicable only to the functional safety
    of systems. It does not deal with other aspects of safety such as the occupational
    health and safety of personnel. While functional safety of systems clearly can
    have an impact on the safety of personnel, there are other aspects of system design
    which can also affect occupational health and safety and which are not covered
    by this document. Cybersecurity aspects of functional safety are addressed only
    to a limited extent. This document applies to all the phases of the life cycle
    of a safety-related electronic system, focusing in particular on phases 5 (architecture
    and apportionment of system requirements) to 10 (system acceptance) as defined
    in IEC 62278-1:-. Requirements for systems which are not related to safety are
    outside the scope of this document. This document is not applicable to existing
    systems, subsystems or equipment which had already been accepted prior to the
    development of this document. However, so far as reasonably practicable, it is
    applicable to modifications and extensions to existing systems, subsystems and
    equipment. This document is primarily applicable to systems, subsystems or equipment
    which have been specifically designed and manufactured for railway signalling
    applications. It is also applicable, so far as reasonably practicable, to general-purpose
    or industrial equipment (e.g. power supplies, display screens or other commercial
    off the shelf items), which is procured for use as part of a safety-related electronic
    system. This document is aimed at railway duty holders, railway suppliers, and
    assessors as well as at safety authorities, although it does not define an approval
    process to be applied by the safety authorities.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) a better alignment
    with the life cycle phases defined in IEC 62278-1 has been made;<br />\r\nb) Clause
    5 describes the requirements that apply to the development of safety-related electronic
    systems (until phase 9 of the life cycle);<br />\r\nc) Clause 8 focuses on the
    requirements for safety acceptance and approval of safety-related electronic systems
    and subsequent phases;<br />\r\nd) requirements and guidance have been added in
    Clause 6 on the following topics:<br />\r\n- reuse of pre-existing systems,<br
    />\r\n- safety-related tools,<br />\r\n- impact of cybersecurity threats on functional
    safety,<br />\r\n- specific application safety cases;<br />\r\ne) requirements
    for the structure and content of the safety case are now defined in a dedicated
    Clause 7;<br />\r\nf) Annex A has been updated for the specification and allocation
    of safety integrity requirements;<br />\r\ng) the content of former Annex D has
    been merged with Annex B, and the content has been changed from informative to
    normative;<br />\r\nh) the status of Annex E has been changed from informative
    to normative;<br />\r\ni) an Annex F has been added as an informative annex on
    User Programmable Integrated Circuits.<br />\r\nA more detailed comparison of
    changes between IEC 62425:2007 and this document can be found in Annex G."
