abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance on the application of processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 to systems of systems (SoS). The scope of this document is the same as ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288, which addresses more than systems engineering activities.<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 Throughout the document, there is mixed use of \"system of systems\" and \"systems
    of systems\". \"SoS\" could refer to a system of systems or systems of systems.
    Similarly, \"CS\" could refer to a constituent system or constituent systems.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides general guidance for each ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 process
    and process outcome in the context of SoS, but it does not address specific activities,
    tasks, methods, or procedures. Additional processes and process outcomes unique
    to SoS can still be needed and are not covered by this document.<br />\r\nThis
    document explores the similarities and differences between systems and SoS and,
    by extension, the similarities and differences between engineering of systems
    and SoS. The guidance contained in this document is expected to evolve as the
    discipline matures.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 In many cases, this document notes that ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 processes or process outcomes \"applies as stated to SoS.\" Some interpretation
    within the context of SoS can still be needed."
