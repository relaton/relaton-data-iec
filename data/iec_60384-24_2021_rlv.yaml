abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-24:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60384-24:2021 applies to
    fixed tantalum electrolytic surface mount capacitors with conductive polymer solid
    electrolyte, which are primarily intended for DC applications for use in electronic
    equipment. The object of this document is to prescribe preferred ratings and characteristics
    and to select from IEC 60384-1:2016 the appropriate quality assessment procedures,
    tests and measuring methods and to give general performance requirements for this
    type of capacitor. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Revision of the structure in
    accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2018, to the extent practicable, and
    harmonization between other similar kinds of documents.<br />\r\n- In addition,
    Clause 5 and all the tables have been reviewed in order to prevent duplications
    and contradictions.</p>"
