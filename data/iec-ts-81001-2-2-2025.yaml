  content: "IEC TS 81001-2-2:2025 presents an informative set of common, high-level
    security-related capabilities and additional considerations to be used across
    the life cycle of health software and health IT systems, for the information exchange
    between the health software manufacturers (including medical device manufacturers),
    healthcare delivery organizations (HDOs) and other stakeholders. It is applicable
    to health software running on any platform and in any environment such as cloud,
    on premise or hybrid.<br />\r\nWhile important security topics, the following
    are outside the scope of this document:<br />\r\na) the security policies of the
    HDO,<br />\r\nb) the product and services security policies of the manufacturer,<br
    />\r\nc) determinations of risk tolerance by the HDO or manufacturer, and<br />\r\nd)
    clinical studies where there is a need to secure personal data.<br />\r\nAs security
    risks can be caused by any product on health IT systems and health IT Infrastructure,
    considerations in this document can be applied for other products that are not
    health software.<br />\r\nIEC TS 81001-2-2:2025 withdraws and replaces:<br />\r\n–
    IEC TR 80001-2-2, Application of risk management for IT-networks incorporating
    medical devices – Part 2-2: Guidance for the communication of medical device security
    needs, risks and controls<br />\r\n– IEC TR 80001-2-8, Application of risk management
    for IT-networks incorporating medical devices – Part 2-8: Application guidance
    – Guidance on standards for establishing the security capabilities identified
    in IEC TR 80001-2-2<br />\r\nThis document includes the following significant
    changes:<br />\r\na) Combines and updates the contents of IEC TR 80001-2-2 and
    IEC TR 80001-2-8;<br />\r\nb) Extends the scope to health software instead to
    only medical device software;<br />\r\nc) Aligns contents and definitions to ISO
    81001-1:2021 and the updated IEC 80001-1;<br />\r\nd) Removed the Configuration
    of Security Features (CNFS) capability, as any configurable security capability
    shall be clearly communicated.<br />\r\ne) Provide security control mappings to
    several new standards, e.g. IEC TR 60601-4-5, IEC 62443-4-2, ISO/IEEE 11073-40102
    and the recent versions of previous standards, e.g. ISO/IEC 27002 and NIST 800-53
    version 5."
