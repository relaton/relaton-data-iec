  content: "IEC TS 62786:2017(E) provides principles and technical requirements for
    distributed energy resources (DERs) connected to the distribution network. It
    applies to the planning, design, operation and connection of DERs to distribution
    networks. It includes general requirements, connection scheme, choice of switchgear,
    normal operating range, immunity to disturbances, active power response to frequency
    deviation, reactive power response to voltage variations and voltage changes,
    EMC and power quality, interface protection, connection and start to generate
    electrical power, active power management, monitoring, control and communication,
    and conformance tests.<br />\r\nThis document specifies interface requirements
    for connection of generating plants with the distribution network operating at
    a nominal frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nDERs include distributed generation
    and permanently connected electrical energy storage in the form of synchronous
    generators, asynchronous generators, converters, etc., connected to the medium
    voltage (MV) or low voltage (LV) distribution network."
