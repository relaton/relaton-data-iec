  content: "IEC 61850-4:2011+A1:2020 applies to projects associated with process near
    automation systems of power utilities (UAS, utility automation system), like e.g.
    substation automation systems (SAS). It defines the system and project management
    for UAS systems with communication between intelligent electronic devices (IEDs)
    in the substation respective plant and the related system requirements. This second
    edition constitutes a technical revision to align the document more closely with
    the other parts of the IEC 61850 series, in addition to enlarging the scope from
    substation automation systems to all utility automation systems.<strong> This
    consolidated version consists of the second edition (2011) and its amendment 1
    (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong><br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid."
