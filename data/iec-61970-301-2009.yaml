    IEC 61970-301:2009(E) defines the Common Information Model (CIM) base set of packages which provide a logical view of the physical aspects of an energy management system including SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition). Whilst there are multiple IEC standards dealing with different parts of the CIM, there is a single, unified normalized information model comprising the CIM behind all these individual standards documents. This second edition contains the following main changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    - change of the naming hierarchy,<br />
    - replacement of several classes,<br />
    - addition of several new classes,<br />
    - many editorial corrections to resolve issues included in the first edition.
    <br /><br />This publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid</a>.
