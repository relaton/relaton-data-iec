    <p>This document, within the context of tools and methods of detailed design and implementation for software and system product lines<b>:</b></p>
    <p>—          provides the terms and definitions specific to realization for software and systems product lines;</p>
    <p>—          defines processes performed during product line realization (those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes);</p>
    <p>—          defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process; and</p>
    <p>—          defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.</p>
    <p>This document concerns processes and capabilities of realization tools and methods for a family of products, not for a single system.</p>
