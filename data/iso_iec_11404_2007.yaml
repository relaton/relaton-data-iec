abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11404:2007 specifies the nomenclature and shared semantics for a collection of
    datatypes commonly occurring in programming languages and software interfaces,
    referred to as the General-Purpose Datatypes (GPD). It specifies both primitive
    datatypes, in the sense of being defined<em>ab initio</em> without reference to
    other datatypes, and non-primitive datatypes, in the sense of being wholly or
    partly defined in terms of other datatypes. The specification of datatypes in
    ISO/IEC 11404:2007 is \"general-purpose\" in the sense that the datatypes specified
    are classes of datatype of which the actual datatypes used in programming languages
    and other entities requiring the concept \"datatype\" are particular instances.
    These datatypes are general in nature; thus, they serve a wide variety of information
    processing applications.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 11404:2007 expressly distinguishes three
    notions of datatype:\r\n\r\n\tthe conceptual, or abstract, notion of a datatype,
    which characterizes the datatype by its nominal values and properties;\r\n\tthe
    structural notion of a datatype, which characterizes the datatype as a conceptual
    organization of specific component datatypes with specific functionalities; and\r\n\tthe
    implementation notion of a datatype, which characterizes the datatype by defining
    the rules for representation of the datatype in a given environment.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC
    11404:2007 defines the abstract notions of many commonly used primitive and non-primitive
    datatypes which possess the structural notion of atomicity. ISO/IEC 11404:2007
    does not define all atomic datatypes; it defines only those which are common in
    programming languages and software interfaces. ISO/IEC 11404:2007 defines structural
    notions for the specification of other non-primitive datatypes, and provides a
    means by which datatypes not defined herein can be defined structurally in terms
    of the GPDs defined herein.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 11404:2007 defines a partial terminology
    for implementation notions of datatypes and provides for the use of this terminology
    in the definition of datatypes. The primary purpose of this terminology is to
    identify common implementation notions associated with datatypes and to distinguish
    them from conceptual notions.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 11404:2007 specifies the required
    elements of mappings between the GPDs and the datatypes of some other language.
    ISO/IEC 11404:2007 does not specify the precise form of a mapping, but rather
    the required information content of a mapping."
