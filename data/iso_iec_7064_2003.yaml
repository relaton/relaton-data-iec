abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 7064:2002 specifies a set of check character systems capable of
    protecting strings against errors which occur when people copy or key data. The
    strings may be of fixed or variable length and may have character sets which arenumeric
    (10 digits: 0 to 9);alphabetic (26 letters: A to Z);alphanumeric (letters and
    digits).Embedded spaces and special characters are ignored.ISO/IEC 7064:2002 specifies
    conformance requirements for products described as generating check characters
    or checking strings using the systems given in this International Standard.ISO/IEC
    7064:2002 is for use in information interchange between organizations; it is also
    strongly recommended as good practice for internal information systems.The check
    character systems specified in ISO/IEC 7064:2002 can detect:all single substitution
    errors (the substitution of a single character for another, for example 4234 for
    1234);all or nearly all single (local) transposition errors (the transposition
    of two single characters, either adjacent or with one character between them,
    for example 12354 or 12543 for 12345);all or nearly all shift errors (shifts of
    the whole string to the left or right);a high proportion of double substitution
    errors (two separate single substitution errors in the same string, for example
    7234587 for 1234567);a high proportion of all other errors.ISO/IEC 7064:2002 excludes
    systems designed specifically to:permit both error detection and automatic correction;detect
    deliberate falsification;check strings interchanged solely between machines.ISO/IEC
    7064:2002 specifies two types of systems:pure systems;hybrid systems.The pure
    systems use a single modulus for all stages of the calculation.'
