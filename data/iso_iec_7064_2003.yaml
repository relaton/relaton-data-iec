abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7064:2002 specifies a set of check character systems capable
    of protecting strings against errors which occur when people copy or key data.
    The strings may be of fixed or variable length and may have character sets which
    are</p><ul><li>numeric (10 digits: 0 to 9);</li><li>alphabetic (26 letters: A
    to Z);</li><li>alphanumeric (letters and digits).</li></ul><p>Embedded spaces
    and special characters are ignored.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7064:2002 specifies conformance
    requirements for products described as generating check characters or checking
    strings using the systems given in this International Standard.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    7064:2002 is for use in information interchange between organizations; it is also
    strongly recommended as good practice for internal information systems.</p><p>The
    check character systems specified in ISO/IEC 7064:2002 can detect:</p><ul><li>all
    single substitution errors (the substitution of a single character for another,
    for example 4234 for 1234);</li><li>all or nearly all single (local) transposition
    errors (the transposition of two single characters, either adjacent or with one
    character between them, for example 12354 or 12543 for 12345);</li><li>all or
    nearly all shift errors (shifts of the whole string to the left or right);</li><li>a
    high proportion of double substitution errors (two separate single substitution
    errors in the same string, for example 7234587 for 1234567);</li><li>a high proportion
    of all other errors.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 7064:2002 excludes systems designed specifically
    to:</p><ul><li>permit both error detection and automatic correction;</li><li>detect
    deliberate falsification;</li><li>check strings interchanged solely between machines.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    7064:2002 specifies two types of systems:</p><ul><li>pure systems;</li><li>hybrid
    systems.</li></ul><p>The pure systems use a single modulus for all stages of the
    calculation.</p>"
