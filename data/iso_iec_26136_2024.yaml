abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple
    identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It enables Clients to verify
    the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization
    Server, as well as to obtain basic profile information about the End-User in an
    interoperable and REST-like manner.</p><p>This document defines a logout mechanism
    that uses front-channel communication via the User Agent between the OP and RPs
    being logged out that does not need an OpenID Provider iframe on Relying Party
    pages. Other protocols have used HTTP GETs to RP URLs that clear login state to
    achieve this. This document does the same thing.</p>
