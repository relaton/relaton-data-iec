abstract:
- content: "<p>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
    protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the
    authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic
    profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.</p><p>This
    document defines a logout mechanism that uses front-channel communication via
    the User Agent between the OP and RPs being logged out that does not need an OpenID
    Provider iframe on Relying Party pages. Other protocols have used HTTP GETs to
    RP URLs that clear login state to achieve this. This document does the same thing.</p>"
