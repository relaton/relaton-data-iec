abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-2-22:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-22:2019
    applies to the Basic Safety and Essential Performance of laser equipment for surgical,
    therapeutic, medical diagnostic, cosmetic or veterinary applications, intended
    for use on humans or animals, classified as Laser Product of Class 1C where the
    Enclosed Laser is of Class 3B or 4, or Class 3B, or Class 4. Medical Electrical
    Equipment or Medical Electrical Systems which incorporate lasers as sources of
    energy being transferred to the Patient or animal and where the lasers are specified
    as above, are referred to as “laser equipment” in this document. Laser Products
    for these applications classified as a Class 1, Class 1M, Class 2, Class 2M or
    Class 3R Laser Product, are covered by IEC 60825-1:2014 and by the general standard.
    If a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable to ME Equipment
    only, or to ME Systems only, the title and content of that clause or subclause
    will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies to ME Equipment
    and to ME Systems, as relevant. Hazards inherent in the intended physiological
    function of laser equipment within the scope of this document are not covered
    by specific requirements in this document except in 7.2.13, Physiological effects,
    of the general standard. If the laser equipment is Class 1C according to IEC 60825-1:2014
    and is used as a laser appliance in a household, it is covered by IEC 60335-2-113:2016.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2007 and
    Amendment 1:2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) it takes account of IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60825-1:2014,
    which have been published since publication of the third edition;<br />\r\nb)
    it addresses technical and safety issues which have arisen since publication of
    the third edition;<br />\r\nc) the scope of this fourth edition differs from the
    scope of the third edition. It now includes Class 1C laser equipment, as defined
    in IEC 60825-1:2014, when the Enclosed Laser is Class 3B or 4;<br />\r\nd) LED
    (light emitting diode) products are now excluded from this document as medical
    LED products may be covered by IEC 60601-2-57."
