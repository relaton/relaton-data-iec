abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 30193:2013 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 100,0 Gbytes. It specifies
    the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and
    the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of
    such disks. User data can be written, read and overwritten many times using a
    reversible method. This disk is identified as a BD Rewritable disk.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    30193:2013 specifies</p><ul><li>one disk Type,</li><li>the conditions for conformance,</li><li>the
    environments in which the disk is to be operated and stored,</li><li>the mechanical
    and physical characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    between data processing systems,</li><li>the format of the information on the
    disk, including the physical disposition of the Tracks and Sectors,</li><li>the
    error-correcting codes and the coding method used,</li><li>the characteristics
    of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read
    data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 30193:2013 provides for interchange of
    disks between disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
