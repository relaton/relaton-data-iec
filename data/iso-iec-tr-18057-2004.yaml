  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 18057:2003 illustrates how ECMA-323 can be used in a Voice
    Browser environment. These concepts illustrated in this TR can be applied to any
    Voice Browser environment that provides an XML-based read/write messaging interface
    (i.e. CSTA Service Boundary) that supports asynchronous events from a CSTA conformant
    communication platform. SALT enabled browsers that implement a ECMA-323 interface
    for call control using the SALT smex mechanism is an example of a browser with
    this capability.</p>"
