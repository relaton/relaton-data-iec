  content: "IEC 62282-4-102:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62282-4-102:2022
    specifies the performance test methods of fuel cell power systems for propulsion
    and auxiliary power units (APU). This document covers fuel cell power systems
    for propulsion other than those for road vehicles. This document applies to gaseous
    hydrogen-fuelled fuel cell power systems and direct methanol fuel cell power systems
    for electrically powered industrial trucks. The following fuels are considered
    within the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- gaseous hydrogen, and<br />\r\n-
    methanol.<br />\r\nThis document covers the fuel cell power system as defined
    in 3.7 and Figure 1. This document applies to DC type fuel cell power systems,
    with a rated output voltage not exceeding DC 150 V for indoor and outdoor use.
    This document covers fuel cell power systems whose fuel source container is permanently
    attached to either the industrial truck or the fuel cell power system.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2017. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na. alignment of the Scope with the second edition of
    IEC 62282-4-101:2022;<br />\r\nb. deletion of terms and definitions (previous
    entries 3.5, 3.10, and 3.15);<br />\r\nc. addition of new terms in Clause 3: \"delivered
    power\" (3.13) and \"regenerated power\" (3.14);<br />\r\nd. revision of symbols
    and their meanings in alignment with those of IEC 62282-3-201;<br />\r\ne. replacement
    of \"reference conditions\" with \"standard conditions\" as seen in Clause 5;<br
    />\r\nf. revision of the test method for the accessory load voltage spike test
    (13.3.2);<br />\r\ng. addition of clarifications in Clause 14 (Power stability
    under operation);<br />\r\nh. addition of a checklist for performance criteria
    dealt with in this document (Annex C).</p>"
