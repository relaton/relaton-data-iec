    for development of biometric solutions for verification and identification processes
    for secure access without physical contact with any device at any time. The solution
    acquires the biometric characteristics that are captured while the data subjects
    are in motion to verify or identify the individuals requiring access, and thus
    controlling access using contactless biometrics.</span></p>
