abstract:
- content: "IEC 60086-5:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60086-5:2016 specifies
    tests and requirements for primary batteries with aqueous electrolyte to ensure
    their safe operation under intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse. This
    fourth<br />\r\nedition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2011.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    The definition of explosion was changed to suitable sentence in order to harmonize
    in IEC 60086 series;<br />\r\n- To prevent removal of hydrogen gas, we revised
    it to the suitable sentence;<br />\r\n- To prevent misuse, the battery compartments
    with parallel connections were revised to the suitable sentence;<br />\r\n- To
    clarify the method to determine the insulation resistance.<br />\r\nKeywords:
    tests and requirements for primary batteries"
