  content: IEC TS 61375-2-4:2017(E) applies to the applications in trains, i.e. it
    covers the application profile for functions belonging to the Train Control and
    Monitoring System (TCMS). The application profile is based on the TCN communication
    system for the data communication between consists of the said trains. This document
    provides for a data interface with parameters and addressing of TCMS functions
    based on the communication profile laid out in IEC 61375-2-3. This document is
    applicable in rolling stock requiring interoperable coupling and uncoupling. This
    part of IEC 61375 may be additionally applicable to closed trains and multiple
    unit trains when so agreed between purchaser and supplier.
