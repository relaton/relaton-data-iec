  content: "IEC 61300-2-18:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-18:2023
    details a procedure to determine the suitability of a fibre optic interconnecting
    device, passive component, splices or closure to withstand the environmental condition
    of extended high temperature that occur during operation, storage and/or transport.
    The test is intended to indicate the performance of such devices when exposed
    to heat of constant temperature over a given period. In general terms, this test
    provides a high temperature to induce potential failures due to softening and
    expansions. This procedure does not assess the ability of a device to operate
    during temperature variations; in this case, IEC 61300-2-22 is used. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2005. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- terms and definitions
    updated according to IEC 61753-1:2018;<br />\r\n- test severities updated according
    to IEC 61753-1:2018;<br />\r\n- simplification of the combination of temperature
    and exposure time."
