abstract:
- content: Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has broad applicability
    to the automatic identification and data capture (AIDC) industry in item management.
    As a wireless communication technique based on radio frequency technology, the
    applications cover multiple levels of the industrial, commercial and retail supply
    chains. These can includefreight containers,returnable transport items (RTI),transport
    units,product packaging, andproduct tagging.Performance tests define test methods
    that deliver results that allow the comparison of different RFID systems, interrogator
    and tags in order to select among them for use in a particular application.The
    performance characteristics of devices (tags and interrogation equipment) can
    vary drastically due to application factors as well as the particular RFID air
    interface (frequency, modulation, protocol, etc.) being supported. Of key concern
    is the matching of the various performance characteristics to the user application.
    Additionally, in an open environment users of such technology demand multiple
    sources for these devices from technology providers. A key challenge is a method
    of evaluating the differences between various technology providers' products in
    a consistent and equitable manner.ISO/IEC 18046-2:2011 provides a framework for
    meeting the above noted concern and challenges. To this end, clear definitions
    of performance as related to user application of RFID technology in the supply
    chain are provided. Based on such application-based definitions, test methods
    are defined with attention to the test parameters required for a consistent evaluation
    of RFID devices.Of particular significance, these tests are defined for RFID devices
    having one antenna. It is common practice to have products with both single and
    multiple antennas to define an RFID transaction zone sufficient for the application.
    The defined test methods used are for a single antenna, but can equivalently be
    extended to equipment with multiple antennas, in order to evaluate performance
    under conditions more closely matching those of a particular application. However
    care must be exercised in multiple-antenna measurement since multiple antennas
    can cause antenna-to-antenna interactions, physical packaging limitations, mutual
    coupling issues, shadowing issues, directivity issues and other impacts, even
    with respect to interrogators since these can be limited in size, shape, and mounting
    method for many RFID applications.ISO/IEC 18046-2:2011 defines test methods for
    performance characteristics of RFID interrogators for item management, and specifies
    the general requirements and test requirements for interrogators which are applicable
    to the selection of the devices for an application. The summary of the test reports
    form a unified tag datasheet. It does not apply to testing in relation to regulatory
    or similar requirements.
