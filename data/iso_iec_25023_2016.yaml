abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 25023:2016 defines quality measures for quantitatively evaluating
    system and software product quality in terms of characteristics and subcharacteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC 25010 and is intended to be used together with ISO/IEC 25010.
    It can be used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 2503n and the ISO/IEC 2504n standards
    or to more generally meet user needs with regard to software product or system
    quality.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 25023:2016 contains the following:<br />\r\n- a basic
    set of quality measures for each characteristic and subcharacteristics;<br />\r\n-
    an explanation of how to apply software product and system quality measures.<br
    />\r\nIt includes, as informative annexes, considerations for the use of quality
    measures (Annex A), QMEs used to define product or system quality measures (Annex
    B), and detailed explanation of measurement types (Annex C).<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    25023:2016 does not assign ranges of values of the measures to rated levels or
    to grades of compliance because these values are defined based on the nature of
    the system, product or a part of the product, and depending on factors such as
    category of the software, integrity level, and users' needs. Some attributes could
    have a desirable range of values, which does not depend on specific user needs
    but depends on generic factors; for example, human cognitive factors.<br />\r\nThe
    proposed quality measures are primarily intended to be used for quality assurance
    and improvement of system and software products during or post the development
    life cycle process.<br />\r\nThe main users of ISO/IEC 25023:2016 are people carrying
    out quality requirement specification and evaluation activities as part of the
    following:<br />\r\n- development: including requirements analysis, design specification,
    coding and testing through acceptance during the life cycle process;<br />\r\n-
    quality management: systematic examination of the software product or computer
    system, for example, when evaluating system or software product quality as part
    of quality assurance, quality control and quality certification;<br />\r\n- supply:
    a contract with the acquirer for the supply of a system, software product or software
    service under the terms of a contract, for example, when validating quality at
    qualification test;<br />\r\n- acquisition: including product selection and acceptance
    testing, when acquiring or procuring a system, software product or software service
    from a supplier;<br />\r\n- maintenance: improvement of the software product or
    system based on quality measurement."
