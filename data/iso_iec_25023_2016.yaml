abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25023:2016 defines quality measures for quantitatively evaluating
    system and software product quality in terms of characteristics and subcharacteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC 25010 and is intended to be used together with ISO/IEC 25010.
    It can be used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 2503n and the ISO/IEC 2504n standards
    or to more generally meet user needs with regard to software product or system
    quality.</p><p>ISO/IEC 25023:2016 contains the following:</p><p>- a basic set
    of quality measures for each characteristic and subcharacteristics;</p><p>- an
    explanation of how to apply software product and system quality measures.</p><p>It
    includes, as informative annexes, considerations for the use of quality measures
    (Annex A), QMEs used to define product or system quality measures (Annex B), and
    detailed explanation of measurement types (Annex C).</p><p>ISO/IEC 25023:2016
    does not assign ranges of values of the measures to rated levels or to grades
    of compliance because these values are defined based on the nature of the system,
    product or a part of the product, and depending on factors such as category of
    the software, integrity level, and users' needs. Some attributes could have a
    desirable range of values, which does not depend on specific user needs but depends
    on generic factors; for example, human cognitive factors.</p><p>The proposed quality
    measures are primarily intended to be used for quality assurance and improvement
    of system and software products during or post the development life cycle process.</p><p>The
    main users of ISO/IEC 25023:2016 are people carrying out quality requirement specification
    and evaluation activities as part of the following:</p><p>- development: including
    requirements analysis, design specification, coding and testing through acceptance
    during the life cycle process;</p><p>- quality management: systematic examination
    of the software product or computer system, for example, when evaluating system
    or software product quality as part of quality assurance, quality control and
    quality certification;</p><p>- supply: a contract with the acquirer for the supply
    of a system, software product or software service under the terms of a contract,
    for example, when validating quality at qualification test;</p><p>- acquisition:
    including product selection and acceptance testing, when acquiring or procuring
    a system, software product or software service from a supplier;</p><p>- maintenance:
    improvement of the software product or system based on quality measurement.</p>"
