abstract:
- content: "IEC 61158-5-26:2023 provides common elements for basic time-critical and
    non-time-critical messaging communications between application programs in an
    automation environment and material specific to Type 26 fieldbus. The term \"time-critical\"
    is used to represent the presence of a time-window, within which one or more specified
    actions are required to be completed with some defined level of certainty. Failure
    to complete specified actions within the time window risks failure of the applications
    requesting the actions, with attendant risk to equipment, plant and possibly human
    life.<br />\r\nThis document defines in an abstract way the externally visible
    service provided by the Type26 fieldbus application layer in terms of:<br />\r\nan
    abstract model for defining application resources (objects) capable of being manipulated
    by users via the use of the FAL service;<br />\r\nthe primitive actions and events
    of the service;<br />\r\nthe parameters associated with each primitive action
    and event, and the form which they take; and<br />\r\nthe interrelationship between
    these actions and events, and their valid sequences."
