abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63227:2020 deals with the protection of PV power supply systems
    against detrimental effects of lightning strikes and surge voltages of atmospheric
    origin. In the event that a lightning and/or surge voltage protection is required
    to be erected, this document describes requirements and measures for maintaining
    the safety, functionality, and availability of the PV power supply systems.
