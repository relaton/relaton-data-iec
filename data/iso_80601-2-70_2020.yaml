abstract:
- content: "This document is applicable to the basic safety and essential performance
    of sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment, hereafter referred to as ME equipment,
    intended to alleviate the symptoms of patients who suffer from obstructive sleep
    apnoea by delivering a therapeutic breathing pressure to the respiratory tract
    of the patient. Sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment is intended for use in
    the home healthcare environment by lay operators as well as in professional healthcare
    institutions.\r\n* Sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment is not considered
    to utilize a physiologic closed-loop-control system unless it uses a physiological
    patient variable to adjust the therapy settings.\r\nThis document excludes sleep
    apnoea breathing therapy equipment intended for use with neonates.\r\nThis document
    is applicable to ME equipment or an ME system intended for those patients who
    are not dependent on mechanical ventilation.\r\nThis document is not applicable
    to ME equipment or an ME system intended for those patients who are dependent
    on mechanical ventilation such as patients with central sleep apnoea.\r\nThis
    document is also applicable to those accessories intended by their manufacturer
    to be connected to sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment, where the characteristics
    of those accessories can affect the basic safety or essential performance of the
    sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment.\r\nMasks and application accessories
    intended for use during sleep apnoea breathing therapy are additionally addressed
    by ISO 17510. Refer to Figure AA.1 for items covered further under this document.\r\nIf
    a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable to ME equipment
    only, or to ME systems only, the title and content of that clause or subclause
    will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to
    ME equipment and to ME systems, as relevant.\r\nHazards inherent in the intended
    physiological function of ME equipment or ME systems within the scope of this
    document are not covered by specific requirements in this document except in 7.2.13
    and 8.4.1 of the general standard.\r\nNOTE See also 4.2 of the general standard.\r\nThis
    document is not applicable to high-frequency jet ventilators (HFJVs) or high-frequency
    oscillatory ventilators (HFOVs), which are given in ISO 80601-2-87[13].\r\nThis
    document does not specify the requirements for ventilators or accessories intended
    for critical care ventilators for ventilator-dependent patients, which are given
    in ISO 80601‑2‑12.\r\nThis document does not specify the requirements for ventilators
    or accessories intended for anaesthetic applications, which are given in ISO 80601-2-13[8].\r\nThis
    document does not specify the requirements for ventilators or accessories intended
    for home care ventilators for ventilator-dependent patients, which are given in
    ISO 80601-2-72[9].\r\nThis document does not specify the requirements for ventilators
    or accessories intended for emergency and transport, which are given in ISO 80601-2-84[12].\r\nThis
    document does not specify the requirements for ventilators or accessories intended
    for home-care ventilatory support, which are given in ISO 80601-2-79[10] and ISO
    80601‑2‑80[11]."
