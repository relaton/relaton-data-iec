abstract:
- content: "Society as a whole is relying increasingly on automation, a trend which
    will not cease but rather will likely intensify in the near future. This reliance
    on automation, which began in the domain of industrial applications, is now being
    replicated in many other areas: in homes, cities, transportation, supply chains,
    etc. For example, it is expected that by 2025, half of the homes in North America
    will rely on some sort of automation. Alongside this trend, the technology for
    virtual sensors, which are less costly than their physical counterparts, has improved
    tremendously, enabling them to be used not only in industrial applications but
    also in consumers goods, such as autonomous vehicles.<br /><br />\r\nThis report
    provides an overview of the technology, some of its common applications, and potential
    gaps in standards covering this area.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology
    trend report was developed by the Virtual Sensor Sub-Working Group (VS-SWG) of
    the Societal and Technology Trend Working Group (STTWG) in the IEC Market Strategy
    Board (MSB).<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available for free download."
