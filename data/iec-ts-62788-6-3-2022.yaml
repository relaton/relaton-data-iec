  content: "IEC TS 62788-6-3:2022 describes the single cantilevered beam (SCB) test,
    useful for characterizing adhesion in photovoltaic (PV) modules. This document
    offers a generalized method for performing the test, with the expectation that
    best practices for utilizing this test method will be developed for specific applications.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides a method for measuring the adhesion energy of most
    interfaces within the photovoltaic (PV) module laminate. This method provides
    a measure of adhesive energy, via the critical energy release rate, and so is
    more useful for comparing adhesion of different specimen types; e.g. different
    materials, module or coupon samples, or materials before and after stress exposure."
