abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document describes the desired joint behaviour
    of MPEG-4 Systems (MPEG-4 File Format) and MPEG-4 Audio codecs. It is desired
    that MPEG-4 Audio encoders and decoders permit finite length signals to be encoded
    to a file (particularly MPEG-4 files) and decoded again to obtain the identical
    signal, subject to codec distortions. This enables the use of audio in systems
    implementations (particularly MPEG-4 Systems), perhaps with other media such as
    video, in a deterministic fashion. Most importantly, the decoded signal has nothing
    “extra” at the beginning or “missing” at the end.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    permits:</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->a)<!--[endif]-->an
    exact "round trip" from raw audio to encoded file back to raw audio (excepting
    encoding artefacts);</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!--
    [if!supportLists]-->b)<!--[endif]-->predictable synchronization between audio
    and other media such as video;</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l1 level1
    lfo2;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->c)<!--[endif]-->correct behaviour when performing
    random access as well as when starting at the beginning of a stream;</p><p class="ListNumber1"
    style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->d)<!--[endif]-->identical
    behaviour when edits are applied in the raw domain and the encoded domain (excepting
    encoding artefacts).</p><p class="MsoBodyText">It is also expected that there
    be predictable interoperability between encoders (as represented by files) and
    decoders. There are two kinds of audio "offsets" (or "delay" in the context of
    transmission): those that are result from the encoding process, and those that
    are result from the decoding process. This document is primarily concerned with
    the latter.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">These issues are resolved by the following:</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->The
    handling of composition time stamps for audio composition units is specified.
    Special care is taken in the case of compressed data, like HE-AAC coded audio,
    that can be decoded in a backward compatible fashion as well as in an enhanced
    fashion.</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->Examples
    are given that show how a finite length signals can be encoded to an MPEG-4 file
    and decoded again to obtain the identical signal, excepting codec distortions.
    Most importantly, the decoded signal has nothing “extra” at the beginning or “missing”
    at the end.</p>'
