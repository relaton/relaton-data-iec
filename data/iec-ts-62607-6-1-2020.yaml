  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-1:2020 establishes a standardized method to determine the
    electrical key control characteristic<br />\r\n– volume resistivity<br />\r\nfor
    powder consisting of graphene-based material like flakes of graphene, few layer
    graphene and/or reduced graphene oxide after preparation of a sample in pellet
    form by<br />\r\n– four probe method<br />\r\nusing powder resistivity measurement
    system.<br />\r\nThe volume resistivity is a measure of the quality of powder-type
    graphene products in terms of electrical property and reflects the density-dependency
    shown in a pellet of powder-type graphene.<br />\r\nThe volume conductivity can
    directly be derived from the volume resistivity.<br />\r\nTypical application
    areas are industries that use powder-type graphene products for graphene manufacture,
    potential developers, and users who produce graphene-based products. As the volume
    resistivity measured according to this document requires the preparation of a
    sample in the form of a pellet, this document describes in detail<br />\r\n– an
    apparatus to prepare consistently a test sample, the pellet,<br />\r\n– the preparation
    of the pellet starting from powder-type graphene,<br />\r\n– the measurement procedure
    to measure the volume resistivity (or volume conductivity) of the pellet, and<br
    />\r\n– the data analysis, the interpretation and reporting of the results."
