    <p>ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003(E) provides guidelines for the preparation of Programming Language Standards.</p>
    <p>Standards for programming languages are developed by many committees from many countries, with many different editors supporting the effort. ISO thus considered it necessary to develop guidelines so that these standards cover at least the following subjects:</p>
    <p>Consistent terminology</p>
    <p>Consistent structure</p>
    <p>Syntax and semantics</p>
    <p>Error and exception handling</p>
    <p>Provisions of options</p>
    <p>Presentation of source programs</p>
    <p>Processor dependences</p>
    <p>Binding strategies to functional standards</p>
    <p>Conformance definition</p>
    <p>Internationalization and support of multiple languages</p>
    <p>Cultural convention related functionality</p>
    <p>Use of expanded character repertoire for identifiers</p>
    <p>User documentation</p>
    <p>The constant additions to ISO/IEC 10646, the Universal character set, necessitate timely updates of ISO/IEC TR 10176 to allow the use of local scripts and characters in programming languages. Annex A of ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 provides such an expanded collection of characters, recommended for use in programming languages.</p>
