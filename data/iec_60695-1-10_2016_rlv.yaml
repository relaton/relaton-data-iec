abstract:
- content: "IEC 60695-1-10:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60695-1-10:2016 provides
    general guidance with respect to fire hazard testing on how to reduce to a tolerable
    level the risk of fire and the potential effects of fires involving electrotechnical
    products. It also serves as a signpost standard to the other guidance publications
    in the IEC 60695 series. It does not give guidance on the use of fire-resistant
    compartment boundaries or on the use of detection and suppression systems for
    the mitigation of fire risk. It describes the relationship between fire risk and
    the potential effects of fire, and provides guidance to IEC product committees
    on<br />\r\nthe applicability of qualitative and quantitative fire tests to the
    fire hazard assessment of electrotechnical products. Details of the calculation
    of fire risk are not included in the scope of this document. It emphasises the
    importance of the scenario approach to fire hazard and risk assessment and discusses
    criteria intended to ensure the development of technically sound hazard-based
    fire test methods. It discusses the different types of fire tests, in particular
    the nature of qualitative and quantitative fire tests. It also describes the circumstances
    under which it is appropriate for IEC product committees to maintain or develop
    qualitative fire tests. This standard is intended as guidance to IEC committees,
    and is to be used with respect to their individual applications. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- reference to IEC 60695-1-12;<br
    />\r\n- modified Introduction and Scope;<br />\r\n- updated normative references;<br
    />\r\n- updated terms and definitions;<br />\r\n- modified Table 1; addition of
    Table 2;<br />\r\n- new text in Subclauses 5.2, 5.3 and 5.4;<br />\r\n- mandatory
    text in Clause 8;<br />\r\n- Annex B changed to Annex A, and modified;<br />\r\n-
    new Annex B concerning common ignition sources.<br />\r\nThis publication is to
    be read in conjunction with IEC 60695-1-11:2014 and IEC 60695-1-12:2015.<br />\r\nKey
    words: Fire Hazard, Fire Risk, Fire Safety Engineering"
