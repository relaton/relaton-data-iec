abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61328:2017(E) provides recommendations for the selection and testing
    where necessary of conductor stringing equipment and accessory items used for
    the installation of bare and insulated overhead distribution conductors, bare
    overhead transmission conductors and overhead earth wires. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2003 and IEC TR 61911:2003.
    It incorporates some technical changes to update equipment work methods and procedures,
    bringing them in line with the state of the art.
