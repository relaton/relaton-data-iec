abstract:
- content: "IEC 61326-3-2:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61326-3-2:2017
    covers all equipment within the scope of IEC 61326-1, but is limited to systems
    and equipment for industrial applications within a specified electromagnetic environment
    and intended to perform safety functions as defined in IEC 61508 with SIL 1-3.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- extension of the frequency range up to 6 GHz for the radio-frequency electromagnetic
    field test according to IEC 61000-4-3,<br />\r\n- replacement of the performance
    criterion FS with DS according to the generic standard IEC 61000-6-7,<br />\r\n-
    adding Table 1 - Aspects to be considered during application of performance criterion
    DS,<br />\r\n- including immunity tests for devices with current consumption >
    16 A according to IEC 61000-4-34,<br />\r\n- updating Figure A.1 and Figure 1
    for better readability,<br />\r\n- adding tests according to IEC 61000-4-16 to
    replace the tests according to IEC 61000-4-6 in the frequency range between 10
    kHz and 150 kHz."
