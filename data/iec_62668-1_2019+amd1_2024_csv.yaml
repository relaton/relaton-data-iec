abstract:
- content: "IEC 62668-1:2019+AMD1:2024 CSV defines requirements for avoiding the use
    of counterfeit, recycled and fraudulent components used in the aerospace, defence
    and high performance (ADHP) industries. It also defines requirements for ADHP
    industries to maintain their intellectual property (IP) for all of their products
    and services. The risks associated with purchasing components outside of franchised
    distributor networks are considered in IEC 62668-2. Although developed for the
    avionics industry, this document can be applied by other high performance and
    high reliability industries at their discretion. This first edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition of IEC TS 62668-1 published in 2016.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) added a reference to AS/EN/JISQ 9100 and AS/EN/JISQ
    9110 which contain anti-counterfeit requirements<br />\r\nb) added reference to
    USA DFAR rule 252.246.7008 and to UK Defence Standard 05-135;<br />\r\nc) added
    reference to more GAO, OECD and ICC reports<br />\r\nd) updated weblinks and other
    references;<br />\r\ne) added new Annex E with figures describing how anti-counterfeit
    documents can be used in supply chains;<br />\r\nf) added a reference to the new
    IECQ OD 3702 traceability audit;<br />\r\ng) added new definition for re-manufactured
    components with a warning that these are not recommended."
