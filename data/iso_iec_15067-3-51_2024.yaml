abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15067-3-51:2024 specifies a Narrow AI Engine Framework including
    requirements for the Energy Management Agent (EMA) specified in ISO/IEC 15067-3.
    This standard includes specifications for an AI infrastructure to be embedded
    in an EMA serving a single structure (home or building) or community housing such
    as an apartment complex. The Narrow AI Engine specified in this standard for EMAs
    enables demand response functionality to be located in each EMA instead of an
    external energy management system. Thus, energy management can be adapted to local
    and customer needs. The Narrow AI Engine includes operational principles such
    as prediction, decision–making, and control.<br />\r\nThis standard builds upon
    the EMA functions of ISO/IEC 15067-3 and ISO/IEC 15067-3-3. The AI functions specified
    in this standard support complex decisions about energy management for devices
    attached to home and buildings networks. These AI specifications enable the EMA
    to allocate power from public sources (including conventional and nonconventional
    sources) and local sources (wind, solar, and storage) according to price, availability,
    appliance and electric vehicle demands, customer preferences, and the customer’s
    budget."
