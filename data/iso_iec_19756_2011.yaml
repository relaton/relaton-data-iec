abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19756:2011 (TMCL) is a constraint language for Topic Maps,
    allowing definitions of Topic Maps schemas to be written in a precise and machine-readable
    form. This makes it possible to validate a topic map against a TMCL schema to
    see if it conforms to the constraints in the schema, and also enables other uses,
    such as schema-driven editors and object mappings.</p><p>TMCL is defined as a
    Topic Maps vocabulary consisting of a number of topic, association, occurrence,
    and role types, identified by Published Subject Identifiers (PSIs), and defined
    using English prose. It defines the concept of validation, by which a given topic
    map is valid according to a schema if it conforms to all the constraints in that
    schema and a number of global validation rules which apply to all topic maps independent
    of schema.</p><p>TMCL does not have any syntax of its own, since it is defined
    simply as a Topic Maps vocabulary. However, a number of CTM templates are defined
    in ISO/IEC 19756:2011 in order to facilitate authoring of TMCL schemas using CTM.</p>"
