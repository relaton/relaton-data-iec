abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 62596:2009(E) is a Publicly Available Specification which provides
    general sampling guidelines and strategies of sampling for electrotechnical products,
    electronic assemblies, electronic components. In order to obtain samples that
    can be used for analytical testing to determine the levels of restricted substances
    as described in the test methods of IEC 62321. Restrictions for substances will
    vary between geographic regions and from time to time. This document describes
    a generic process for the sampling of any substance which could be restricted.
