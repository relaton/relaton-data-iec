abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62898-3-4:2023 provides technical requirements for the monitoring
    and control of microgrids. This document applies to non-isolated or isolated microgrids
    integrated with distributed energy resources. This document describes the specific
    recommendations for low-voltage (LV) and medium-voltage (MV) microgrids.<br />\r\nThis
    document focuses on standardization of the architecture, functions, and operation
    of microgrid monitoring and control systems (MMCS). It teases out the general
    functions of MMCS and provides technical requirements for MMCS. This document
    includes the following aspects of MMCS:<br />\r\n• system architecture,<br />\r\n•
    information exchange with other devices/functions in microgrid,<br />\r\n• performance
    requirement,<br />\r\n• main function descriptions."
