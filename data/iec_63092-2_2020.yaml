abstract:
- content: "IEC 63092-2:2020 specifies BIPV system requirements and applies to photovoltaic
    systems that are integrated into buildings with the photovoltaic modules used
    as building products. It focuses on the properties of these photovoltaic systems
    relevant to basic building requirements and the applicable electrotechnical requirements.<br
    />\r\nThis document addresses requirements on the BIPV systems in the specific
    ways they are intended to be mounted and the mounting structure, but not the BIPV
    module itself, which is within the scope of IEC 63092-1."
