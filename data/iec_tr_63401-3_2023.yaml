abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63401-3:2023, which is a Technical Report, provides an insight
    into the various forms of fast frequency response and frequency ride-through techniques
    that involve inverter-based generation sources (mainly wind and PV) in a bulk
    electrical system.<br />\r\nThis document first focuses on extracting the clear
    definition of FFR from different references around the world, while studying the
    mechanism of FFR acting on system frequency and the unique features of FFR. It
    then compares various kinds of frequency response and demonstrates the relationship
    among synchronous inertia response, fast frequency response, and primary frequency
    response. Several system needs and conditions where FFR is suitable are identified.
    This document also focuses on the performance objectives, practicality and capabilities
    of various non-synchronous resources, and discusses the test methods for verifying
    FFR capability at different levels. Finally, it focuses on the ROCOF issues and
    on the robust performances of FFR.."
