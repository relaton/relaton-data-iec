abstract:
- content: Specifies a method of exchanging time-critical and non-time-critical data
    through local-area networks by mapping ACSI to MMS and ISO/IEC 8802-3 frames.
    MMS services and protocol are specified to operate over full OSI and TCP compliant
    communications profiles. The use of MMS allows provisions for supporting both
    centralized and distributed architectures. This standard includes the exchange
    of real-time data indications, control operations, report notification.<br /><br
    />This publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid.
