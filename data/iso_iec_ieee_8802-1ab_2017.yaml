abstract:
- content: "<p>The scope of ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-1AB:2017 is to define a protocol and
    management elements, suitable for advertising information to stations attached
    to the same IEEE 802 LAN, for the purpose of populating physical topology and
    device discovery management information databases. The protocol facilitates the
    identification of stations connected by IEEE 802 LANs/MANs, their points of interconnection,
    and access points for management protocols.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-1AB:2017 defines
    a protocol that</p><p>a) Advertises connectivity and management information about
    the local station to adjacent stations on the same IEEE 802 LAN.</p><p>b) Receives
    network management information from adjacent stations on the same IEEE 802 LAN.</p><p>c)
    Operates with all IEEE 802 access protocols and network media.</p><p>d) Establishes
    a network management information schema and object definitions that are suitable
    for storing connection information about adjacent stations.</p><p>e) Provides
    compatibility with the IETF PTOPO MIB (IETF RFC 2922 [B9]).1</p>"
