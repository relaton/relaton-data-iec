  content: IEC TR 62343-6-12:2023 which is a Technical Report, reports the results
    of a recently conducted survey on performance specifications for 1 × <em>N</em>
    wavelength selective switches. This information is intended to provide a framework
    for the preparation of performance specification standards for wavelength selective
    switches. The purpose of this document is to provide guidelines for performance
    values of the specification items listed in IEC 62343-3-3.
