  content: "IEC/IEEE 63253-5713-8:2024 describes electrical and mechanical requirements
    of single-phase station service voltage transformers with system voltages of 46
    kV or higher and with the maximum rated voltage of the power winding of 1 000
    V.<br />\r\nThis document is a basis for the establishment of performance and
    limited electrical and mechanical interchangeability requirements of the equipment
    are described. It is also a basis for assistance in the proper selection of such
    equipment.<br />\r\nA station service voltage transformer (SSVT) is a single-phase
    transformer to be connected line-to-earth on an effectively earthed system. It
    can be used either as an individual unit for supplying single-phase loads, or
    in a three-phase bank to support three-phase loads. A typical application is to
    supply substation power such as lighting, pump and motor loads. The SSVT can be
    provided with a measuring winding when requested by the user."
