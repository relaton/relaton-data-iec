    <p>ISO/IEC 24759:2017 specifies the methods to be used by testing laboratories to test whether the cryptographic module conforms to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012. The methods are developed to provide a high degree of objectivity during the testing process and to ensure consistency across the testing laboratories.</p>
    <p>This document also specifies the requirements for information that vendors provide to testing laboratories as supporting evidence to demonstrate their cryptographic modules' conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012.</p>
    <p>Vendors can use this document as guidance in trying to verify whether their cryptographic modules satisfy the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 before they apply to the testing laboratory for testing.</p>
