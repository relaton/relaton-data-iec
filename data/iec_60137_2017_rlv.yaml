abstract:
- content: "IEC 60137:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60137:2017
    specifies the characteristics and tests for insulated bushings.<br />\r\nThis
    standard is applicable to bushings, as defined in Clause 3, intended for use in
    electrical apparatus, machinery, transformers, switchgear and installations for
    three-phase alternating current systems, having highest voltage for equipment
    above 1 000 V and power frequencies of 15 Hz up to and including 60 Hz.<br />\r\nSubject
    to special agreement between purchaser and supplier, this standard may be applied,
    in part or as a whole, to the following:<br />\r\n- bushings used in other than
    three-phase systems;<br />\r\n- bushings for high-voltage direct current systems;<br
    />\r\n- bushings for testing transformers;<br />\r\n- bushings for capacitors.<br
    />\r\nSpecial requirements and tests for transformer bushings in this standard
    apply also to reactor bushings.<br />\r\nThis standard is applicable to bushings
    made and sold separately. Bushings which are a part of an apparatus and which
    cannot be tested according to this standard should be tested with the apparatus
    of which they form part. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Resin-impregnated synthetic
    (RIS) bushings has been introduced.<br />\r\n- Bushings with Um â‰¤ 1,1 kV, Um =
    1100 kV and Um = 1200 kV have been introduced.<br />\r\n- Temperature rise testing
    has been included for liquid-insulated bushings according to clause to 3.4.<br
    />\r\n- Introducing dry lightning impulse testing as a routine test for all transformer
    bushings with Um > 72,5 kV.<br />\r\n- The altitude correction procedure has been
    revised ( > 1 000 m).<br />\r\n- An explanation about Very Fast Transient (VFT)
    phenomenon and its impact on bushings has been included.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of May 2018 have been included in this copy."
