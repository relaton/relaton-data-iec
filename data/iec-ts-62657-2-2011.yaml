  content: 'IEC/TS 62657-2:2011(E) specifies the fundamental assumptions, concepts,
    parameters, and procedure for wireless communication coexistence. It provides
    guidelines, requirements, and best practices for wireless communications'' availability
    and performance, covering the life cycle of wireless communication coexistence
    to help the work of all persons involved with the relevant responsibilities to
    cope with the critical aspects in each phase of wireless communication coexistence
    management in an automation plant. Additionally it provides a common point of
    reference for wireless communication coexistence for industrial automation sites
    as a homogeneous guideline to help the users assess and gauge their plant efforts.
    Life cycle aspects include: planning, designing, installation, implementation,
    operation, maintenance, administration and training.'
