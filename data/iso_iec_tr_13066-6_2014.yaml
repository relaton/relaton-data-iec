    - Further introductory explanations regarding the content and use of the API beyond those found in Annex A of ISO/IEC 13066-1;<br />
    - An overview of the main properties, including of:<br />
    - user interface elements;<br />
    - how to get and set focus;<br />
    - of communication mechanisms in the API;<br />
    - a discussion of design considerations for the API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility guidance related to using the API);<br />
    - information on extending the API (and where this is appropriate);<br />
    - an introduction to the programming interface of the API (including pointers to external sources of information);<br />
    - an introduction to the Java Access Bridge for Windows and the Java Access Bridge for GNOME.

    It will provide this information as an introduction to the Java API to assist:<br />
    - IT system level developers who create custom controls and/or interface to them;<br />
    - AT developers involved in programming "hardware to software" and "software to software" interactions.
