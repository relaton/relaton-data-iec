abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-6:2014 provides an overview to the structure and terminology
    of the Java accessibility application programming interface (API) It will provide:</p><ul><li>A
    description of the overall architecture and terminology of the API;</li><li>Further
    introductory explanations regarding the content and use of the API beyond those
    found in Annex A of ISO/IEC 13066-1;</li><li>An overview of the main properties,
    including of:<ul><li>user interface elements;</li><li>how to get and set focus;</li><li>of
    communication mechanisms in the API;</li><li>a discussion of design considerations
    for the API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility
    guidance related to using the API);</li><li>information on extending the API (and
    where this is appropriate);</li><li>an introduction to the programming interface
    of the API (including pointers to external sources of information);</li><li>an
    introduction to the Java Access Bridge for Windows and the Java Access Bridge
    for GNOME.</li></ul></li></ul><p>It will provide this information as an introduction
    to the Java API to assist:</p><ul><li>IT system level developers who create custom
    controls and/or interface to them;</li><li>AT developers involved in programming
    "hardware to software" and "software to software" interactions.</li></ul>
