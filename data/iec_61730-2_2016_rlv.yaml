abstract:
- content: "IEC 61730-2:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61730-2:2016 provides
    the testing sequence intended to verify the safety of PV modules whose construction
    has been assessed by IEC 61730-1. The test sequence and pass criteria are designed
    to detect the potential breakdown of internal and external components of PV modules
    that would result in fire, electric shock, and/or personal injury. The standard
    defines the basic safety test requirements and additional tests that are a function
    of the PV module end-use applications. Test categories include general inspection,
    electrical shock hazard, fire hazard, mechanical stress, and environmental stress.
    This new edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the test sequences have been rearranged;<br
    />\r\n- various tests have been detailed or added."
