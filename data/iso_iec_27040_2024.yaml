abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document provides detailed technical requirements and guidance on
    how organizations can achieve an appropriate level of risk mitigation by employing
    a well-proven and consistent approach to the planning, design, documentation,
    and implementation of data storage security. Storage security applies to the protection
    of data both while stored in information and communications technology (ICT) systems
    and while in transit across the communication links associated with storage. Storage
    security includes the security of devices and media, management activities related
    to the devices and media, applications and services, and controlling or monitoring
    user activities during the lifetime of devices and media, and after end of use
    or end of life.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none;
    text-autospace: none;">Storage security is relevant to anyone involved in owning,
    operating, or using data storage devices, media, and networks. This includes senior
    managers, acquirers of storage products and services, and other non-technical
    managers or users, in addition to managers and administrators who have specific
    responsibilities for information or storage security, storage operation, or who
    are responsible for an organizationâ€™s overall security programme and security
    policy development. It is also relevant to anyone involved in the planning, design,
    and implementation of the architectural aspects of storage network security.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This
    document provides an overview of storage security concepts and related definitions.
    It includes requirements and guidance on the threats, design, and control aspects
    associated with typical storage scenarios and storage technology areas. In addition,
    it provides references to other international standards and technical reports
    that address existing practices and techniques that can be applied to storage
    security.</p>'
