abstract:
- content: 'This document defines Ethernet local area, access and metropolitan area
    networks. Ethernet is specified at selected speeds of operation; and uses a common
    media access control (MAC) specification and management information base (MIB).
    The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol
    specifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation.
    Speed specific Media Independent Interfaces (MIIs) provide an architectural and
    optional implementation interface to selected Physical Layer entities (PHY). The
    Physical Layer encodes frames for transmission and decodes received frames with
    the modulation specified for the speed of operation, transmission medium and supported
    link length. Other specified capabilities include: control and management protocols,
    and the provision of power over selected twisted pair PHY types.'
