  content: "IEC TR 62660-4:2017(E) provides the test data on the candidate alternative
    test methods for the internal short circuit test according to 6.4.4.2.2 of IEC
    62660-3:2016. The internal short circuit test in this document is intended to
    simulate an internal short circuit of a cell caused by the contamination of conductive
    particle, and to verify the safety performance of the cell under such conditions.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to the secondary lithium-ion cells and cell
    blocks used for propulsion of electric vehicles (EV) including battery electric
    vehicles (BEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).<br />\r\nThis document does
    not cover cylindrical cells."
