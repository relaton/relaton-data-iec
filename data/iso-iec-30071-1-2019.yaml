    <p>This document takes a holistic approach to the accessibility of information and communications technology (ICT) by combining guidance on implementing the accessibility of ICT systems (ICT accessibility) both at organizational and system development levels.</p>
    <p>This document gives guidelines for building and maintaining ICT systems (including products and services) that are accessible to diverse users (including users with disabilities and older people).</p>
    <p>This document is applicable to all types of organizations. This document applies to the breadth of ICT systems and the results of convergent and emerging technologies within an organization including, but not limited to: information systems; intranet systems; websites; mobile and wearable applications; social media; and Internet of Things (IoT) systems.</p>
    <p>It gives requirements and recommendations for organizations:</p>
    <p>a)    ensuring accessibility is considered in their policies or strategy by creating an organizational ICT accessibility policy;</p>
    <p>b)    embedding the consideration of accessibility decisions through the entire process of developing procuring, installing, operating and maintaining ICT systems, and documenting these choices;</p>
    <p>c)    justifying decisions on accessibility;</p>
    <p>d)    communicating the ICT system's accessibility decisions to its users at launch, through creating and publishing its accessibility statement.</p>
