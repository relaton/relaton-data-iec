abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Supplementary Service (SS)
    Single Step Call Transfer (SSCT), which is applicable to</p><p>various basic services
    supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified
    in ISO/IEC</p><p>11574.</p><p>SS-SSCT is a supplementary service that enables
    an SSCT user, user A, to transform an existing call between user A and user</p><p>B
    into a new call between user B and a user C whereby user A does not have a call
    established with user C prior to call</p><p>transfer.</p><p>Supplementary service
    specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. This</p><p>International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage
    2 specifications of SS-SSCT. The stage 1 specification (clause 6)</p><p>specifies
    the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause
    7) identifies the Functional Entities</p><p>involved in the supplementary service
    and the information flows between them.</p>"
