abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO/IEC 10373 series defines test methods for characteristics of
    identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test
    method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC
    7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information
    storage technologies employed in identification card applications.</p><p>NOTE
    1 Criteria for acceptability do not form part of the ISO/IEC 10373 series, but
    can be found in the International Standards mentioned above.</p><p>NOTE 2 Test
    methods defined in the ISO/IEC 10373 series are intended to be performed separately.
    A given card is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.</p><p>This
    document deals with test methods, which are specific to contactless integrated
    circuit card (vicinity card) technology. ISO/IEC 10373-1 deals with test methods
    which are common to one or more ICC technologies and other parts in the ISO/IEC
    10373 series deal with other technology‑specific tests.</p><p>Unless otherwise
    specified, the tests in this document apply exclusively to vicinity cards defined
    in ISO/IEC 15693‑1, ISO/IEC 15693-2 and ISO/IEC 15693-3.</p>"
