abstract:
- content: "IEC 60086-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60086-1:2015 is intended
    to standardize primary batteries with respect to dimensions, nomenclature, terminal
    configurations, markings, test methods, typical performance, safety and environmental
    aspects. As a primary battery classification tool, electrochemical systems are
    also standardized with respect to system letter, electrodes, electrolyte, nominal
    and maximum open circuit voltage. The object of this part of IEC 60086 is to benefit
    primary battery users, device designers and battery manufacturers by ensuring
    that batteries from different manufacturers are interchangeable according to standard
    form, fit and function. Furthermore, to ensure compliance with the above, this
    part specifies standard test methods for testing primary cells and batteries.
    This twelfth edition cancels and replaces the eleventh edition (2011) and constitutes
    a technical revision. The major technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition are:<br />\r\n- the order of the Annexes was changed to the order in which
    they appear in the document and a caption was added to indicate where the Annex
    information first appears in the document;<br />\r\n- the humidity conditions
    for non P-system batteries in Table 3 was modified;<br />\r\n- the standard discharge
    voltage for the Y and W chemistries was determined to be at 3,5 V and 2,8 V respectively;<br
    />\r\n- details on capacity measurement were moved from Annex E to Subclause 5.1.<br
    />\r\n- the coin/button cell and battery definition was clarified in order to
    better address issues with the swallowing of coin cells.<br />\r\nKeywords: fundamental
    requirements and information on primary cells and batteries"
