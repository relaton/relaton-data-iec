  content: "IEC 61196-1-105:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61196-1-105:2024
    applies to coaxial communication cables. It specifies test methods for determining
    the withstand voltage of the dielectric of coaxial cables. It is intended to detect
    the flaws in the dielectric of finished coaxial cables. The test procedures for
    the cables with special structure are specified in Annex A."
