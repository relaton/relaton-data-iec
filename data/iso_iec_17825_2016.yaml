abstract:
- content: '<p>ISO/IEC 17825:2016 specifies the non-invasive attack mitigation test
    metrics for determining conformance to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790
    for Security Levels 3 and 4. The test metrics are associated with the security
    functions specified in ISO/IEC 19790. Testing will be conducted at the defined
    boundary of the cryptographic module and I/O available at its defined boundary.</p><p>The
    test methods used by testing laboratories to test whether the cryptographic module
    conforms to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790 and the test metrics specified
    in this International Standard for each of the associated security functions specified
    in ISO/IEC 19790 are specified in ISO/IEC 24759. The test approach employed in
    this International Standard is an efficient "push-button" approach: the tests
    are technically sound, repeatable and have moderate costs.</p>'
