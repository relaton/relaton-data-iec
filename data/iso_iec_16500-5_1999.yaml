abstract:
- content: <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 covers the high and mid layer protocols for
    DAVIC systems. It defines a set of</p><p>protocol components ("tools") which are
    referenced by ISO/IEC 16500-2 ("System Dynamics, Scenarios, and</p><p>Protocol
    Requirements").</p><p>In particular this part of ISO/IEC 16500 describes the protocol
    stacks required for the support of the DAVIC</p><p>flows, i.e., S1 through S5.
    The specific DAVIC options for each of the protocols are specified as well as
    the</p><p>different optional protocols stacks applicable. Requirements on protocols
    at specific interfaces are also considered</p><p>and included in the specification.</p>
