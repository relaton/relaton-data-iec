  content: "IEC TS 62257-1:2015(E) introduces a methodology for implementing rural
    electrification using autonomous hybrid renewable energy systems. It also provides
    a guide for facilitating the reading and the use of the IEC 62257 series for setting
    up decentralized rural electrification in developing countries or in developed
    countries. The IEC 62257 series is designed as follows:<br />\r\n- Parts 2 to
    6 are methodological supports for the management and implementation of projects;<br
    />\r\n- Parts 7 to 12 are technical specifications for individual or collective
    systems and associated components.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be
    read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/searchform&amp;q=62257\">IEC
    62257 series</a>."
