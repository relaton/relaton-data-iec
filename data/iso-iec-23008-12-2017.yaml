    <p>The formats defined in ISO/IEC 23008-12:2017 enable the interchange, editing, and display of images, as well as the carriage of metadata associated with those images.</p>
    <p>The Image File Format builds on tools defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 to define an interoperable storage format for a single image, a collection of images, and sequences of images.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23008-12:2017 specifies brands for the storage of images and image sequences conforming to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC).</p>
    <p>NOTE       The storage of HEVC video sequences is out of scope and is handled by ISO/IEC 14496‑15.</p>
    <p>This format defines normative structures used to contain metadata, how to link that metadata to the images, and defines how metadata of certain forms is carried.</p>
