abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19794-15:2017 specifies an image interchange format for biometric
    person identification or verification technologies that utilize human palm crease
    biometric images and can be used for the exchange and comparison of palm crease
    image data. It specifies a data record interchange format for storing, recording,
    and transmitting palm crease biometric information from palm crease imaging. It
    defines the contents, format, and units of measurement for the image exchange.
    The format consists of mandatory and optional items, including scanning parameters,
    compressed or uncompressed image specifications and vendor-specific information.
    Information compiled and formatted in accordance with this document can be recorded
    on machine-readable media or may be transmitted by data communication facilities.
