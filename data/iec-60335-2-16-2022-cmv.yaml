  content: "IEC 60335-2-16:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-16:2022 edition 6.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-16:2002+AMD1:2008+AMD2:2011
    CSV edition 5.2. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-16:2022
    deals with the safety of electric food waste disposers for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless possibly pose a source
    of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national
    water supply authorities and similar authorities, leading to restriction of or
    prohibition of the installation of food waste disposers.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n– portable food waste disposers;<br />\r\n– food waste
    disposers of the incinerator type;<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial or commercial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used
    in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels
    and replaces the fifth edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment
    2:2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been converted
    to normative text (Clause 1, 22.104);<br />\r\nc) addition of temperature rise
    limits for accessible surface (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
