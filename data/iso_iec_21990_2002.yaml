abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21990:2002 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Short Message
    Service (SMS) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN).<br />\r\nThis service is based on GSM 03.40. The Service Centre functionality
    described in ISO/IEC 21990:2002 is equal to the functionality of a Service Centre
    in GSM 03.40. Thus, for interoperability with a GSM network, it is only necessary
    to implement a QSIG interface.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The interworking with other air
    interfaces is not precluded, but is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 21990:2002.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 The Short Message Service is a special type of basic service but
    is described in the present document as a supplementary service.<br />\r\nThe
    Short Message Service is a service which permits a served user to send a message
    of limited size to another user in the same PISN or another network.<br />\r\nThe
    Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300
    387. ISO/IEC 21990:2002 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 21989.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SMS operates on top of
    the signalling protocol for the connection oriented call independent APDU transport
    mechanism and uses certain further aspects of the generic procedures for the control
    of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 21990:2002
    also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of
    interactions at the Q reference point between SMS and supplementary services and
    ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 21990:2002 is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected
    to form a PISN."
