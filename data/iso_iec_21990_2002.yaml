abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 21990:2002 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Short Message Service (SMS) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated
    services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN).</p><p>This service is based on GSM 03.40. The Service
    Centre functionality described in ISO/IEC 21990:2002 is equal to the functionality
    of a Service Centre in GSM 03.40. Thus, for interoperability with a GSM network,
    it is only necessary to implement a QSIG interface.</p><p>NOTE 1 The interworking
    with other air interfaces is not precluded, but is outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    21990:2002.</p><p>NOTE 2 The Short Message Service is a special type of basic
    service but is described in the present document as a supplementary service.</p><p>The
    Short Message Service is a service which permits a served user to send a message
    of limited size to another user in the same PISN or another network.</p><p>The
    Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300
    387. ISO/IEC 21990:2002 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 21989.</p><p>The signalling protocol for SMS operates on top of the
    signalling protocol for the connection oriented call independent APDU transport
    mechanism and uses certain further aspects of the generic procedures for the control
    of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 21990:2002
    also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of
    interactions at the Q reference point between SMS and supplementary services and
    ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 21990:2002 is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected
    to form a PISN.</p>"
