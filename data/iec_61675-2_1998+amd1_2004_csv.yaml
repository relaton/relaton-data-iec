abstract:
- content: Specifies terminology and test methods for describing the characteristics
    of Anger type rotational gamma camera single photon emission computed tomographs
    (SPECT), equipped with parallel hole collimators. As these systems are based on
    Anger type gamma cameras this part of IEC 61675 shall be used in conjunction with
    IEC 60789. These systems consist of a gantry system, single or multiple detector
    heads and a computer system together with acquisition, recording, and display
    devices. This part of IEC 61675-2 also specifies test conditions for declaring
    the characteristics of single photon computer tomographs operated in coincidence
    mode as well as in single photon mode. The test methods specified for coincidence
    mode are based on the test methods for dedicated PET tomographs as described in
    IEC 61675-1 to reflect as well as possible the clinical use of coincidence detection.
    Tests have been modified to reflect the limited sensitivity and count rate characteristics
    of the single photon computer tomographs operated in coincidence detection mode
    only when needed. The test methods specified in this part of IEC 61675 have been
    selected to reflect as much as possible the clinical use of Anger type rotational
    gamma camera single photon emission computed tomographs (SPECT). It is intended
    that the test methods be carried out by manufacturers thereby enabling them to
    describe the characteristics of SPECT systems on a common basis. This consolidated
    version consists of the first edition (1998) and its amendment 1 (2004). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.
