abstract:
- content: This document defines a technical solution for encrypting resources of
    EPUB publications, effectively registering a device certificate to providers and
    securely delivering decryption keys to reading systems included in licenses tailored
    to specific devices. This technical solution uses the passphrase-based authentication
    method defined in ISO/IEC TS 23078-2 for reading systems to receive the license
    and access the encrypted resources of such digital publications.
