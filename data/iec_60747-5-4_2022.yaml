abstract:
- content: "IEC 60747-5-4:2022(E) specifies the terminology, the essential ratings
    and characteristics as well as the measuring methods of semiconductor lasers.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tReferences for the terms and definitions related
    to the lighting area, IEC 60050-845, are revised based on IEC 60050-845:2020;\r\n\tEmission
    angle is changed to radiation angle in 3.3.2;\r\n\tDefinitions of rise time and
    fall time in 3.4.1 are revised based on the publication IEC 60050-521:2002;\r\n\tSpectral
    linewidth is added to Table 1 in Clause 4;\r\n\tConditions for carrier-to-noise
    ratio of Table 1 in Clause 4 is amended.\r\n\tError in the equation for carrier-to-noise
    ratio in 5.2.2 is corrected;\r\n\tPrecaution against the equipment used for carrier-to-noise
    ratio measurement is added in 5.2.2;\r\n\tExplanation for the measurement method
    of the small signal cut-off frequency in 5.3.2 of the first edition is deleted
    because it has been defined in the latest version of ISO 11554;\r\n\tReference
    document for the lifetime in 5.4 is amended;\r\n\tPrecaution against the measuring
    arrangement used for<em>the</em>half-intensity width and 1/<em>e</em>2-intensity
    is added in 5.5.3;\r\n\tReference tables in Annex A, Annex B and Annex C are revised
    by following the latest version of ISO publications."
