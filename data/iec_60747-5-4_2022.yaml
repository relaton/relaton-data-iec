abstract:
- content: "IEC 60747-5-4:2022(E) specifies the terminology, the essential ratings
    and characteristics as well as the measuring methods of semiconductor lasers.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"><li style=\"text-align:justify\">References
    for the terms and definitions related to the lighting area, IEC 60050-845, are
    revised based on IEC 60050-845:2020;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Emission
    angle is changed to radiation angle in 3.3.2;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Definitions
    of rise time and fall time in 3.4.1 are revised based on the publication IEC 60050-521:2002;</li><li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">Spectral linewidth is added to Table 1 in Clause
    4;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Conditions for carrier-to-noise ratio
    of Table 1 in Clause 4 is amended.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Error
    in the equation for carrier-to-noise ratio in 5.2.2 is corrected;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Precaution
    against the equipment used for carrier-to-noise ratio measurement is added in
    5.2.2;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Explanation for the measurement method
    of the small signal cut-off frequency in 5.3.2 of the first edition is deleted
    because it has been defined in the latest version of ISO 11554;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\"
    value=\"1\">Reference document for the lifetime in 5.4 is amended;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\"
    value=\"10\">Precaution against the measuring arrangement used for<em>the</em>half-intensity
    width and 1/<em>e</em>2-intensity is added in 5.5.3;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Reference
    tables in Annex A, Annex B and Annex C are revised by following the latest version
    of ISO publications.</li></ol>"
