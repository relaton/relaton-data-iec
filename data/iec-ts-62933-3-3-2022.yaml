  content: IEC TS 62933-3-3:2022 provides requirements, guidelines and references
    when EES systems are designed, controlled and operated for energy intensive, islanded
    grid and backup power supply applications. In energy intensive applications, the
    EES system provides long charge and discharge phases at variable powers to the
    supported grid or user equipment. In islanded operation, the EES system provides
    energy to the islanded grid and coordinates other power generation systems in
    the islanded grid. In backup power supply and emergency support, the EES system
    provides energy to the internal grid or a set of emergency loads when the main
    grid power supply is not available.
