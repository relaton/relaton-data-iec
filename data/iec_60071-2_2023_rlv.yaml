abstract:
- content: "IEC 60071-2:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60071-2:2023
    constitutes application guidelines and deals with the selection of insulation
    levels of equipment or installations for three-phase AC systems. Its aim is to
    give guidance for the determination of the rated withstand voltages for ranges
    I and II of IEC 60071â€‘1 and to justify the association of these rated values with
    the standardized highest voltages for equipment. This association is for insulation
    co-ordination purposes only. The requirements for human safety are not covered
    by this document. This document covers three-phase AC systems with nominal voltages
    above 1 kV, phase-to-earth, phase-to-phase and longitudinal insulation. It has
    the status of a horizontal standard in accordance with IEC Guide 108. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 4 Concepts governing the insulation co-ordination
    has been added.<br />\r\nb) Subclause 5.3 has been revised, and Subclause 5.4
    Detailed simulation has been added because it is widely applied in the recent
    practices of insulation coordination.<br />\r\nc) Special considerations for cable
    line and GIL/GIB have been added in Clause 9.<br />\r\nd) Annex K (informative)
    Application of line shunt reactor to limitation of TOV and SFO in high voltage
    overhead transmission lines has been added.<br />\r\ne) Annex L (informative)
    Calculation of lightning stroke rate and lightning outage rate has been added."
