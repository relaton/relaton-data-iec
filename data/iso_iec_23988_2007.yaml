abstract:
- content: 'Growth in the power and capabilities of information technology (IT) has
    led to the increasing use of IT to deliver, score and record responses of tests
    and assessments in a wide range of educational and other contexts. Suitably used,
    IT delivery offers advantages of speed and efficiency, better feedback and improvements
    in validity and reliability, but its increased use has raised issues about the
    security and fairness of IT-delivered assessments, as well as resulting in a wide
    range of different practices.   ISO/IEC 23988:2007 provides a means of    showing
    that the delivery and scoring of the assessment are fair and do not disadvantage
    some groups of candidates, for example those who are not IT literate;  showing
    that a summative assessment has been conducted under secure conditions and is
    the authentic work of the candidate;  showing that the validity of the assessment
    is not compromised by IT delivery;  providing evidence of the security of the
    assessment, which can be presented to regulatory and funding organizations (including
    regulatory bodies in education and training, in industry or in financial services);  establishing
    a consistent approach to the regulations for delivery, which should be of benefit
    to assessment centres who deal with more than one assessment distributer;  giving
    an assurance of quality to purchasers of "off-the-shelf" assessment software.     ISO/IEC
    23988:2007 gives recommendations on the use of IT to deliver assessments to candidates
    and to record and score their responses. Its scope is defined in terms of three
    dimensions: the types of assessment to which it applies, the stages of the assessment
    "life cycle" to which it applies and its focus on specifically IT aspects.'
