    <p class="MsoNormal">The set of AT Attachment standards consists of this document and the ATA implementation standards described in AT Attachment - 8 ATA/ATAPI Architecture Model (ATA8-AAM). This document specifies the command set that host systems use to access storage devices that implement the Host Aware Zones feature set (see 4.3), the Host Managed Zones feature set (see 4.4), the Zone Domains feature set (see 4.5), and the Zone Realms feature set (see 4.6). This document provides a common command set for systems manufacturers, system integrators, software suppliers, and suppliers of storage devices that provide one or more of the zones feature sets. Figure 1 shows the relationship of This document to other ATA standards as well as related device and host standards and specifications (e.g., SCSI standards and SATA-I0 specifications).</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">This document maintains compatibility with the ACS-5 standard, INCITS 558-202x, while providing additional functions.</p>
