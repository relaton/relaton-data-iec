abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23004-6:2008 specifies the interfaces of the support application
    programming interface (API) and the realization technology used for Fault Management
    in MPEG Multimedia Middleware (M3W). Fault Management is an optional framework
    for M3W Platforms. The goal is to have a dependable/reliable system in the context
    of faults. These faults can be introduced due to upgrades and extensions out of
    control of the device vendor. The faults can also exist because it is impossible
    to test all traces and configurations in the complex software systems we are building
    nowadays. ISO/IEC 23004-6:2008 specifies an approach of adding fault tolerance
    mechanism through the use of a Middleman (wrapper), an approach for transparent
    instantation of these Middlemans (wrappers), interfaces for coordination of fault
    handling between Middlemans (wrappers).
