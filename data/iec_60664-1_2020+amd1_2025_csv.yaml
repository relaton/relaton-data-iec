abstract:
- content: "IEC 60664-1:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with insulation coordination for
    equipment having a rated voltage up to AC 1 000 V or DC 1 500 V connected to low-voltage
    supply systems. This document applies to frequencies up to 30 kHz. It applies
    to equipment for use up to 2 000 m above sea level and provides guidance for use
    at higher altitudes. It provides requirements for technical committees to determine
    clearances, creepage distances and criteria for solid insulation. It includes
    methods of electrical testing with respect to insulation coordination. The minimum
    clearances specified in this document do not apply where ionized gases are present.
    Special requirements for such situations can be specified at the discretion of
    the relevant technical committee. This document does not deal with distances:<br
    />\r\n– through liquid insulation;<br />\r\n– through gases other than air;<br
    />\r\n– through compressed air.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\nupdate of the
    Scope, Clauses 2 and 3,<br />\r\naddition of 1 500 V DC into tables,<br />\r\nnew
    structure for Clauses 4 and 5,<br />\r\naddition of Annex G with a flowchart for
    clearances,<br />\r\naddition of Annex H with a flowchart for creepage distances,<br
    />\r\nupdate of distances altitude correction in a new Table F.10.<br />\r\nIt
    has the status of a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
