  content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165, FC-100-DF-EL-S, specifies a Media Dependent Interface
    for duplex Ethernet transmission of 100 MB&#x2F;s--a physical layer interface
    for a signalling rate of 1 062,5 Mbit&#x2F;s over two pairs--for operation over
    Class F balanced cabling channels, for up to 100 m of Category 7 balanced (twisted
    pair) cabling. It includes a functional description of an Ethernet physical layer
    for 100 MB&#x2F;s transmission of low complexity that can easily be implemented
    by many vendors. Taking advantage of the improved transmission characteristics
    provided by balanced cabling channels Class F as specified in ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801
    (2002), it eliminates the need for implementation of the complex functions specified
    in ISO&#x2F;IEC 8802-3 that cancel the effects of crosstalk and return loss. This
    provides a solution that can operate at a much lower power level, and that can
    be implemented at a lower cost than products that use Clause 40 of ISO&#x2F;IEC
    8802-3. Therefore it also has the potential for multiple ports per chip.
