abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 21823-3:2021 provides the basic concepts for IoT systems
    semantic interoperability, as described in the facet model of ISO&#x2F;IEC 21823-1,
    including:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n– requirements of the core ontologies for semantic
    interoperability;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n– best practices and guidance on how to
    use ontologies and to develop domain-specific applications, including the need
    to allow for extensibility and connection to external ontologies;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n–
    cross-domain specification and formalization of ontologies to provide harmonized
    utilization of existing ontologies;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n– relevant IoT ontologies
    along with comparative study of the characteristics and approaches in terms of
    modularity, extensibility, reusability, scalability, interoperability with upper
    ontologies, and so on, and;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n– use cases and service scenarios
    that exhibit necessities and requirements of semantic interoperability."
