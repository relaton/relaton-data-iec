abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-2:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC/IEEE 62582-2:2022 contains
    methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation
    and control systems using the indenter measurement technique in the detail necessary
    to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes the requirements
    for the selection of samples, the measurement system and measurement conditions,
    and the reporting of the measurement results. This document is intended for application
    to non-energised equipment. This document is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo
    standard. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2011, and its Amendment 1:2016. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Modification
    of the title;<br />\r\n- Consideration of publication of IEC/IEEE 60780-323.</p>"
