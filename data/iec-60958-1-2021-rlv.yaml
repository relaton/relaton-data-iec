  content: "IEC 60958-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60958-1:2021
    describes a serial, uni-directional, self-clocking interface for the interconnection
    of digital audio equipment for consumer and professional applications. It provides
    the basic structure of the interface. Separate documents define items specific
    to particular applications. The interface is primarily intended to carry monophonic
    or stereophonic programmes, encoded using linear PCM and with a resolution of
    up to 24 bits per sample. When used for other purposes, the interface is able
    to carry audio data coded other than as linear PCM coded audio samples. Provision
    is also made to allow the interface to carry data related to computer software,
    multimedia technologies, or signals coded using non linear PCM. The format specification
    for these applications is not part of this document. The interface is intended
    for operation at audio sampling frequencies of 32 kHz and above. Auxiliary information
    is transmitted along with the programme. IEC 60958-1:2021c ancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2008, and Amendment 1:2014. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The relevant part of
    IEC 60958-5 is supported."
