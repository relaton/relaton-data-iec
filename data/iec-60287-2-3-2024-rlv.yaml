  content: "IEC 60287-2-3:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60287-2-3:2024
    describes a method for calculating the continuous current rating factor for cables
    of all voltages installed in ventilated tunnels. The method is applicable to any
    type of cable. The method applies to natural as well as forced ventilation. Longitudinal
    heat transfer within the cables and the surroundings of the tunnel is assumed
    to be negligible. All cables are assumed to be identical within the tunnel and
    it is assumed that the tunnel cross-section does not change with distance along
    the tunnel."
