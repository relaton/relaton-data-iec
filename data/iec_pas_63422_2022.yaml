abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63422:2022(E) Book 20 defines a smart interface between an indoor
    LED luminaire and a sensing/communication module. The module connects to the LED
    driver and control system, and typically can provide sensory inputs or enable
    communication between network components. Modules can be installed and replaced
    in the field. Book 1 defines the common concepts that underlie the Zhaga interface
    specifications. In addition, this Book 1 specifies general requirements for Zhaga
    compliant components of LED Luminaires.
