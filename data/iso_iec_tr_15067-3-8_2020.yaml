abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC TR 15067-3-8:2020 (E), which is a Technical Report, provides
    a conceptual framework for developing architectures and designing solutions related
    to transactive energy (TE). Transactive energy allows electricity generated locally
    by consumers using wind, solar, storage, etc., at homes or buildings to be sold
    into a competitive market. This document provides guidance for enhancing interoperability
    among distributed energy resources involved in energy management systems at homes
    and buildings. It addresses gaps identified as problematic for the industry by
    providing definitions of terms, architectural principles and guidelines, and other
    descriptive elements that present a common ground for all interested parties to
    discuss and advance TE.\r\nThis document builds upon ISO&#x2F;IEC 15067-3, with
    technology to accommodate a market for buying and selling electricity generated
    centrally or locally by consumers. The energy management agent (EMA) specified
    in ISO&#x2F;IEC 15067-3 can represent the customer as a participant in TE. Transactive
    energy is important for achieving electric grid stability as power from renewable
    sources such as wind and solar fluctuates with time and weather."
