abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61496-4-3:2015(E) specifies requirements for the design, construction
    and testing of electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed specifically
    to detect persons or parts of persons as part of a safety-related system, employing
    vision-based protective devices (VBPDs) using stereo vision techniques (VBPDST)
    for the sensing function. Special attention is directed to features which ensure
    that an appropriate safety-related performance is achieved.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 61496-1:2012."
