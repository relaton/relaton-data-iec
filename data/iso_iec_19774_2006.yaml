abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19774:2006, specifies a systematic method for representing humanoids
    in a network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia environment. Conceptually, each
    humanoid is an articulated character that can be embedded in different representation
    systems and animated using the facilities provided by the representation system.
    ISO/IEC 19774:2006 specifies the abstract form and structure of humanoids.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 19774:2006 is intended for a wide variety of presentation
    systems and application, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation
    of the functionality."
