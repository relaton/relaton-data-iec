    /><br />\r\nIEC 60704-2-9:2024 applies to electric hand-held hairdryers for household
    and similar use supplied from mains, which operate with a flow of air. These particular
    requirements can also be applied to analogous electrically operated devices such
    as hairstyling appliances, which produce the airflow by a fan. Helmet-type hairdryers
    are excluded from this document. This document does not apply to hair care appliances
    with radiant heating. For determining and verifying noise emission values declared
    in product specifications, see IEC 60704-3. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Alignment with IEC 60704-1:2021.<br />\r\nThis
    part 2-9 is intended to be used in conjunction with the fourth edition of IEC
    60704-1:2021: Household and similar electrical appliances - Test code for the
    determination of airborne acoustical noise - Part 1: General requirements."
