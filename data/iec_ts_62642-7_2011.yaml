abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62642-7:2011(E) provides guidance on the design, planning, operation,
    installation, commissioning and maintenance of intrusion and hold-up alarm system
    (I&HAS) installed in buildings. Requirements for I&HAS are specified in IEC 62642-1:2010.
    It also applies to intruder alarm system and hold-up alarm system when these systems
    are installed independently. These application guidelines are intended to assist
    those responsible for establishing an I&HAS to ascertain the appropriate design
    of I&HAS both in terms of the extent of the supervision required and in determining
    the grade of system performance necessary to provide the degree of supervision
    considered appropriate.
