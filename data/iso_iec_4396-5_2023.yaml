abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines the procedure executed by
    a Member of a distributed inter-process communication (IPC) facility (DIF) or
    distributed application facility (DAF) to initialize a new Member as a fully functioning
    Member. This document defines the procedure for a new Member to enrol when the
    new Member was recently a Member of the DIF or DAF. This document is defined for
    use with DIFs, but it can be used equally well by a DAF that wants to assign synonyms
    with a scope limited to the DAF.</p>
