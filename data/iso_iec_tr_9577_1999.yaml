abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    Recommendation | Technical Report provides:<br />\r\na) the description of a means
    to permit a protocol to be identified;<br />\r\nb) a record of the structure and
    allowable ranges of protocol identifier(s) which can be assigned by ITU-T, ISO/IEC
    and other authorities;<br />\r\nc) a record of the values of protocol identifiers
    used by OSI Network layer protocols and non-OSI protocols occupying a similar
    position: in particular, protocols with protocol control information commencing
    in octet 1 of the protocol data unit (header-oriented protocols), and protocols
    with protocol control information commencing in the final octet of the protocol
    data unit (trailer-oriented protocols), are covered; and<br />\r\nd) a record
    of the values that are in use as protocol control information in non-Network layer
    protocols where they impact on Network layer protocol identification.<br />\r\nThe
    application of this Recommendation | Technical Report is:<br />\r\na) in the identification
    of internationally standardized Network layer protocols operating directly above
    the Data Link service;<br />\r\nb) in the identification of protocols used in
    conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer protocols that operate
    directly above the Data Link service; and<br />\r\nc) to distinguish between Internationally
    standardized Network layer protocols, and other internationally standardized protocols
    used in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer protocols.<br
    />\r\nThis Recommendation | Technical Report is for use by ITU-T Study Groups,
    ISO/IEC Technical Committees and other authorities in applying the principles
    contained in clause 4, and in selecting an unused value or values from the range
    of values permitted in clauses 5 or 6, as appropriate. When a new value is selected,
    that value and its usage should be brought to the attention of ITU-T Study Group
    7 or ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC6 so that this Recommendation | Technical Report can be amended."
