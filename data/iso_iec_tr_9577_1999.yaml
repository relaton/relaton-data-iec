abstract:
- content: "<p>This Recommendation | Technical Report provides:</p><p>a) the description
    of a means to permit a protocol to be identified;</p><p>b) a record of the structure
    and allowable ranges of protocol identifier(s) which can be assigned by ITU-T,</p><p>ISO/IEC
    and other authorities;</p><p>c) a record of the values of protocol identifiers
    used by OSI Network layer protocols and non-OSI protocols</p><p>occupying a similar
    position: in particular, protocols with protocol control information commencing
    in</p><p>octet 1 of the protocol data unit (header-oriented protocols), and protocols
    with protocol control</p><p>information commencing in the final octet of the protocol
    data unit (trailer-oriented protocols), are</p><p>covered; and</p><p>d) a record
    of the values that are in use as protocol control information in non-Network layer
    protocols</p><p>where they impact on Network layer protocol identification.</p><p>The
    application of this Recommendation | Technical Report is:</p><p>a) in the identification
    of internationally standardized Network layer protocols operating directly above
    the</p><p>Data Link service;</p><p>b) in the identification of protocols used
    in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer</p><p>protocols
    that operate directly above the Data Link service; and</p><p>c) to distinguish
    between Internationally standardized Network layer protocols, and other internationally</p><p>standardized
    protocols used in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer
    protocols.</p><p>This Recommendation | Technical Report is for use by ITU-T Study
    Groups, ISO/IEC Technical Committees and other</p><p>authorities in applying the
    principles contained in clause 4, and in selecting an unused value or values from
    the range of</p><p>values permitted in clauses 5 or 6, as appropriate. When a
    new value is selected, that value and its usage should be</p><p>brought to the
    attention of ITU-T Study Group 7 or ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC6 so that this Recommendation
    | Technical Report</p><p>can be amended.</p>"
