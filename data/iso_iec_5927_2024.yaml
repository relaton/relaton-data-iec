abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies how augmented reality (AR)
    and virtual reality (VR) devices are to be set up and used in the enterprise workplace
    in a manner that ensures health and safety (H&amp;S) is maintained, H&amp;S consequences
    are understood, and additional risks are not introduced. Within this concept of
    safe usage, there is particular focus on guidance around safe immersion (time)
    and safety in the workplace.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines the
    concepts of AR, VR, the virtuality continuum and other associated terms such as
    augmented virtuality and mixed reality. This document provides guidance on:</p><p

    class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->d)<!--[endif]-->safe
    usage and immersion in VR systems both in the consumer and enterprise domains.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document focuses on visual aspects of AR and VR. Other
    modes such as haptics and olfactory are not addressed within this document.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document covers both the hardware (the physical AR/VR
    head mounted displays) and areas of visual stimulus (the environments and graphics
    displayed in those headsets). This document does not cover all possible visual
    stimulus scenarios; focus is directed toward those areas that are known to have
    implications on safe use. This specifically includes the source vection (visual
    illusion of self-motion in physically stationary AR/VR users) and/or motion (physical
    movement of AR/VR users) and associated safe use considerations.</p><p class="Note">NOTE
    AR/VR have some shared safety concerns, but many are distinct to AR or VR and
    a consumer or enterprise environment. As such all of these are in scope, and this
    document is structured to account for these differences.</p>'
