abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-2-14:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-14:2021
    describes a procedure for determining the suitability of a fibre optic interconnecting
    device or a passive component to withstand exposure to the optical power which
    occurs during its operation. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- harmonizing IEC 61300-1:2016 and IEC 61300-3-4:2012;<br
    />\r\n- addition of abbreviated terms;<br />\r\n- addition of Clause A.2 regarding
    input optical power from both ends."
