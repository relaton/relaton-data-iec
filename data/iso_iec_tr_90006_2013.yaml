abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 provides guidelines for the application of ISO 9001:2008
    to service management for IT services. Examples provided in the guidelines are
    for service management of IT services. Additionally, ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 provides
    guidelines for the alignment and integration of a QMS and SMS in organizations
    where services are being delivered to internal or external customers. The guidelines
    about integration provided can be applicable to a scope including IT services
    and other non-IT services as required. ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 provides a comparison
    of the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 and ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. It highlights those
    areas where there is the greatest similarity between the two management systems,
    and where there are differences between the two. ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 cites and
    explains the requirements of ISO 9001:2008 in its application to service management
    and its integration with ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011, but does not add to or otherwise
    change the requirements of ISO 9001 or ISO/IEC 20000-1. The guidelines provided
    in ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 are not intended to be used as criteria for conformity
    assessments or audits. ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 can apply to organizations of all
    sizes, sectors, and types with different organizational forms or business models.
    ISO/IEC/TR 90006:2013 can be used by:<br />\r\n- auditors and assessors looking
    for guidelines on audits for ISO 9001:2008 with a scope that includes services
    and service management;<br />\r\n- auditors and assessors looking for guidelines
