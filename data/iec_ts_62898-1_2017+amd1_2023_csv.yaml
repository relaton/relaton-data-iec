abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62898-1:2017+AMD1:2023 provides guidelines for microgrid projects
    planning and specification. Microgrids considered in this document are alternating
    current (AC) electrical systems with loads and distributed energy resources (DER)
    at low or medium voltage level. This document does not cover direct current (DC)
    microgrids. Microgrids are classified into isolated microgrids and non-isolated
    microgrids. Isolated microgrids have no electrical connection to a wider electric
    power system. Non-isolated microgrids can act as controllable units to the electric
    power system and can operate in the following two modes:<br />\r\n- grid-connected
    mode;<br />\r\n- island mode.<br />\r\nThis document will cover the following
    areas:<br />\r\n- microgrid application, resource analysis, generation forecast,
    and load forecast;<br />\r\n- DER planning and microgrid power system planning;<br
    />\r\n- high level technical requirements for DER in microgrids, for microgrid
    connection to the distribution system, and for control, protection and communication
    systems;<br />\r\n- evaluation of microgrid projects."
