  content: "IEC TR 60068-3-12:2022(E) which is a Technical Report, describes the creation
    of temperature-time profiles (in specific envelope profiles) for reflow soldering
    of electronic assemblies, considering tolerances resulting from the accuracy of
    the measuring equipment, preparation method and specifications of the manufacturers
    of components, circuit boards, solder paste, etc.).<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">a) Extended purpose</div>\r\nGuidance is added on
    how to create a reflow profile considering the tolerances resulting from the accuracy
    of the measuring equipment, preparation method and specifications of the component
    manufacturers (components, PCB, solder paste, etc.).\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">b)
    Distinction from existing standards</div>\r\nThe envelope profile given in this
    document does not represent a temperature-time profile for the qualification of
    materials but defines the reflow process limits for the soldering of electronic
    assemblies.<br />\r\nThe schematic temperature-time-limit curves of the envelope
    profile are derived from generally valid findings (literature data). Additionally,
    tolerance considerations are given for all envelope points of the envelope profile.<br
    />\r\nIn contrast to IEC TR 60068-3-12:2014, the creation of the envelope profile
    is not primarily linked to a concrete example.\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">c)
    Subclause 8.2 presents an approach for establishing a possible temperature profile
    for a lead-free reflow soldering process using SnAgCu solder paste that is taken
    from IEC TR 60068-3-12:2014.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">d)
    Synergies with existing standards</div>\r\nLimit values and tolerances from standards
    and guidelines for the qualification of materials are included in this document
    and are listed as examples in the references."
