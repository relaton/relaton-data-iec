  content: "IEC 61133:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61133:2016 specifies
    general criteria to demonstrate by testing that newly constructed complete railway
    vehicles conform with standards or other normative documents. This International
    Standard, as a whole or in part, applies to all railway vehicles except special
    purpose vehicles such as track-laying machines, ballast cleaners and personnel
    carriers. The extent of application of the standard for particular vehicles will
    be specifically mentioned in the contract, to take account, where necessary, of
    any legislative requirements. The main technical changes with regard to the previous
    edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- references to standards other than international
    have been removed from the main text so the notes refer solely to Annex B;<br
    />\r\n- Annex B has been updated with the latest European information,<br />\r\n-
    and cross-references between the TSIs and ENs and the clauses of IEC 61133 have
    been added."
