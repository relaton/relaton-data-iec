  content: "IEC 63055:2016(E) defines a common interoperable format that will be used
    for the design of<br />\r\na) large-scale integration (LSI),<br />\r\nb) packages
    for such LSI, and<br />\r\nc) printed circuit boards on which the packaged LSI
    are interconnected. Collectively, such designs are referred to as \"LSI-Package-Board\"
    (LPB) designs. The format provides a common way to specify information/data about
    the project management, netlists, components, design rules, and geometries used
    in LPB designs. This standard is published as a double logo IEC-IEEE standard."
