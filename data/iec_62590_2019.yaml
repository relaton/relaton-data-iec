abstract:
- content: "IEC 62590:2019 specifies the requirements for the performance of all fixed
    installations electronic power converters, using controllable and/or non-controllable
    electronic valves, intended for traction power supply. The devices can be controlled
    by means of current, voltage or light. Non-bistable devices are assumed to be
    operated in the switched mode.<br />\r\nThis document applies to fixed installations
    of the following electric traction systems:<br />\r\n- railways,<br />\r\n- guided
    mass transport systems such as: tramways, light rail systems, elevated and underground
    railways, mountain railways, trolleybuses.<br />\r\nThis standard is based on
    EN 50328. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2010. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Incorporation of DC converters.<br
    />\r\nb) Correction of the clearances and withstand voltages due to erroneous
    use of PD in former edition.<br />\r\nc) adaption of structure, adaption of vocabulary,
    removal of unused term and abbreviations."
