abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 61850-80-3:2015(E) describes the requirements and gives an overview
    of the technical solution for using web protocols as a new communication mapping
    (SCSM) for the IEC 61850 standard. The structure of this part of IEC 61850 illustrates
    a two-step approach: Collection of the use cases and requirements based upon emerging
    Smart Grid architectural considerations, taking into account the new extended
    scope of IEC 61850. Evaluation and selection of technologies in order to build
    a consistent SCSM.'
