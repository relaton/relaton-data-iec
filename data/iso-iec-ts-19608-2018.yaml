    <p>This document provides guidance for:</p>
    <p>—          selecting and specifying security functional requirements (SFRs) from ISO/IEC 15408-2 to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII);</p>
    <p>—          the procedure to define both privacy and security functional requirements in a coordinated manner; and</p>
    <p>—          developing privacy functional requirements as extended components based on the privacy principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100 through the paradigm described in ISO/IEC 15408-2.</p>
    <p>The intended audience for this document are:</p>
    <p>—          developers who implement products or systems that deal with PII and want to undergo a security evaluation of those products using ISO/IEC 15408. They will get guidance how to select security functional requirements for the Security Target of their product or system that map to the privacy principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100;</p>
    <p>—          authors of Protection Profiles that address the protection of PII; and</p>
    <p>—          evaluators that use ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC 18045 for a security evaluation.</p>
    <p>This document is intended to be fully consistent with ISO/IEC 15408; however, in the event of any inconsistency between this document and ISO/IEC 15408, the latter, as a normative standard, takes precedence.</p>
