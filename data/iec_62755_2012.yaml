abstract:
- content: IEC 62755:2012(E) provides a uniform format for data to be output from
    radiation measurement instruments for use in detection of illicit trafficking
    of radioactive materials. This enables interpretation of data without reference
    to manufacturer's documentation. This standard specifies the data format used
    for both required and optional data available at the output of radiation measurement
    instruments that are used for the detection of illicit trafficking of radioactive
    materials. The performance requirements for these types of radiation measurement
    instruments are described in other standards such as IEC 62401, IEC 62533, IEC
    62694, IEC 62244, IEC 62327, IEC 62484, and IEC 62618.
