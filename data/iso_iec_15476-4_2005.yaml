abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 15476-4:2005 explains the Data models subject area. The CDIF semantic
    metamodel is used to ensure that the information held by tools communicating using
    CDIF is transferred with an agreed meaning. It covers the information required
    to express Entity-Relationship-Attribute Modelling and Logical Database Design
    concepts.   ISO/IEC 15476-4:2005 is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand
    and/or use CDIF. It provides a definition of a single subject area of the CDIF
    semantic metamodel. It is suitable for:    Those evaluating CDIF,  Those who wish
    to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and  Those developing
    importers and exporters.'
