    <p>ISO/IEC 15414:2015 provides:</p>
    <p>a)    a language (the enterprise language) comprising concepts, structures, and rules for developing, representing and reasoning about a specification of an ODP system from the enterprise viewpoint (as defined in Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3); </p>
    <p>b)    rules which establish correspondences between the enterprise language and the other viewpoint languages (defined in Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3) to ensure the overall consistency of a specification.</p>
    <p>The language is specified to a level of detail sufficient to enable the determination of the compliance of any modelling language to this Recommendation | International Standard and to establish requirements for new specification techniques.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15414:2015 is intended for use in preparing enterprise viewpoint specifications of ODP systems, and in developing notations and tools to support such specifications.</p>
    <p>As specified in clause 5 of Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746‑3, an enterprise viewpoint specification defines the purpose, scope and policies of an ODP system.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15414:2015 is a refinement and extension of Rec. ITU‑T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746‑3, clauses 5 and 10, but does not replace them.</p>
