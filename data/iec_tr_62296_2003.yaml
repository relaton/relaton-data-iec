    This Technical Report contains a series of recommendations developed by an expert working group of IEC subcommittee 62A in response to questions of interpretation of the second edition of IEC 60601-1.

    This Technical Report is primarily intended to be used by:

    - manufacturers of medical electrical equippment;

    - test houses and others responsible for assessment of compliance with IEC 60601-1, and

    - those developing subsequent editions of IEC 60601-1.

    The recommendations in the first edition of IEC/TR 62296 have been considered in preparing the third edition of IEC 60601-1. If and when additional recommendations are developed by IEC/SC 62A/WG 14 and published as amendments to this technical report, these will also be considered for incorporation into the third edition through the amendment/revision process.
