abstract:
- content: "IEC 62002-1:2008(E) is a radio access specification for mobile, portable
    and hand-held portable devices capable of receiving DVB-T/H services. It includes
    informative system aspects as well as specifications for minimum RF-performance.
    It covers terminals in three main classes, namely integrated car terminals, portable
    digital TV sets and hand-held portable convergence terminals. Interoperability
    with integrated cellular radios is also considered. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition, published in 2005 and constitutes a technical
    revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n-
    DVB-H has been included as a part of the main specification;<br />\r\n- All the
    performance figures have bee revised as new simulation results have been made
    available as well as new reference receivers for DVB-H have been developed;<br
    />\r\n- DVB-H now includes all the different MPE-FEC code rates;<br />\r\n- New
    portable indoor and portable outdoor channel models have been included as well
    as performance figures for those;<br />\r\n- A new 2x TU-6 mobile SFN test channel
    has been included;<br />\r\n- A new L4 linearity pattern has been added;<br />\r\n-
    Dedicated performance figures for DVB-H for S1, S2, L1 to L4 interference patterns
    have been included;<br />\r\n- A new GSM-interference measurement method has been
    added. The contents of the corrigendum of July 2008 have been included in this
