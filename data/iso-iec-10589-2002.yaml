    <p>This International Standard specifies a protocol which is used by Network Layer entities operating the protocol specified in</p>
    <p>ISO 8473 in Intermediate Systems to maintain routeing information for the purpose of routeing within a single routeing</p>
    <p>domain. The protocol specified in this International Standard relies upon the provision of a connectionless-mode underlying</p>
    <p>service.1)</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies:</p>
    <p>a) procedures for the transmission of configuration and routeing information between network entities residing in</p>
    <p>Intermediate Systems within a single routeing domain;</p>
    <p>b) the encoding of the protocol data units used for the transmission of the configuration and routeing information;</p>
    <p>c) procedures for the correct interpretation of protocol control information; and</p>
    <p>d) the functional requirements for implementations claiming conformance to this International Standard.</p>
    <p>The procedures are defined in terms of</p>
    <p>a) the interactions between Intermediate system Network entities through the exchange of protocol data units;</p>
    <p>b) the interactions between a Network entity and an underlying service provider through the exchange of subnetwork service</p>
    <p>primitives; and</p>
    <p>c) the constraints on route determination which must be observed by each Intermediate system when each has a routeing</p>
    <p>information base which is consistent with the others.</p>
