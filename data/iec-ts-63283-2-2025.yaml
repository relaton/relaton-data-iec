  content: "IEC TS 63283-2: 2025 has the goal of analyzing the impact of smart manufacturing
    on the daily operation of an industrial facility. It focusses on the perspective
    of automation and control of the production system, but also on the supporting
    processes of ordering, supply chain management, design, engineering and commissioning,
    operational technology, life cycle management, maintenance management, and resource
    management.<br />\r\nThese recommendations are accomplished on the basis of several
    carefully selected use cases that are familiar to manufacturing industry. Therefore,
    each use case is described, followed by an analysis of the possible influence
    of smart manufacturing and the assessment of the impact on existing and future
    standardization.<br />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    of IEC TR 63283-2 published in 2022. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) additional use cases (Clause 6);<br />\r\nb)
    clustering of the requirements for standardization (Clause 7);<br />\r\nc) consolidation
    of the use cases contributing to the cluster “Computing infrastructure” (Clause
    8 and Annex D);<br />\r\nd) consolidation of the business context of the use cases
    (Annex C)."
