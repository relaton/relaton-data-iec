abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-20-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60749-20-1:2019 applies
    to all devices subjected to bulk solder reflow processes during PCB assembly,
    including plastic encapsulated packages, process sensitive devices, and other
    moisture-sensitive devices made with moisture-permeable materials (epoxies, silicones,
    etc.) that are exposed to the ambient air.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this document
    is to provide SMD manufacturers and users with standardized methods for handling,
    packing, shipping, and use of moisture/reflow sensitive SMDs that have been classified
    to the levels defined in IEC 60749-20. These methods are provided to avoid damage
    from moisture absorption and exposure to solder reflow temperatures that can result
    in yield and reliability degradation. By using these procedures, safe and damage-free
    reflow can be achieved, with the dry packing process, providing a minimum shelf
    life capability in sealed dry-bags from the seal date. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- updates to subclauses to better align the test method with IPC/JEDEC J-STD-033C,
    including new sections on aqueous cleaning and dry pack precautions;<br />\r\n-
    addition of two annexes on colorimetric testing of HIC (humidity indicator card)
    and derivation of bake tables.</p>"
