abstract:
- content: "IEC 62783-1:2019(E) specifies definitions and requirements of twinax cables
    used in digital communication systems. These cables are intended to be used in
    indoor applications. This generic specification details the requirements and transmission
    characteristics for single twinax elements as well as multiple twinax elements
    within the same sheath, i.e. “twinax cable”.<br />\r\nThis generic specification
    is supplemented with family specifications that give additional requirements based
    on the specific application, e.g. the maximum specified frequency of the cables."
