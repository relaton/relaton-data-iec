abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the combination of base standards, together with
    the selection of appropriate options and<br />\r\nparameter values, necessary
    to specify how QSIG / PSS1 can be used to provide digital signalling capabilities
    at interfaces at the C reference point between a Private Integrated services Network
    eXchange (PINX) and an Interconnecting Network (ICN) to permit interoperability
    between equipment from different vendors and different public or private service
    providers.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 - PINX in the sense of this International Standard
    is used in the meaning of a PINX directly attached to the ICN.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard is applicable to attached PINXs and Interconnecting Networks (ICN).<br
    />\r\nThis International Standard identifies the necessary or optional employment
    of particular functions, procedures and services when provided:<br />\r\n- physical
    and electrical characteristics (physical layer) of the interfaces to the transmission
    systems to be employed;<br />\r\n- data link layer procedures;<br />\r\n- network
    layer procedures; and<br />\r\n- supplementary services and additional network
    features to meet specific corporate network user requirements.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard states requirements upon attached PINXs and Interconnecting Network (ICN)
    implementations in order to achieve interoperability between equipment in PISNs
    serving as Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs).<br />\r\nNOTE 2 - Implementation
    of this International Standard does not preclude a manufacturer from offering
    other means of interconnection. It also does not preclude a VPN service provider
    to offer basic call communications between a PINX and other networks like PSTN
    or ISDN.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 14475 specifies various access arrangements between
    a PINX and a public network where reference points C and T reside either at a
    single or at separate interfaces. The scope of this International Standard is
    limited to cover the C reference point aspects at a separate interface.<br />\r\nThe
    current version of this International Standard does not intend to specify any
    gateway or end PINX requirements for the ICN side of the interface. Therefore
    it typically uses the term \"virtual transit PINX\" instead of Interconnecting
    Network (ICN)."
