abstract:
- content: <p>This International Standard specifies the combination of base standards,
    together with the selection of appropriate options and</p><p>parameter values,
    necessary to specify how QSIG / PSS1 can be used to provide digital signalling
    capabilities at interfaces at</p><p>the C reference point between a Private Integrated
    services Network eXchange (PINX) and an Interconnecting Network (ICN)</p><p>to
    permit interoperability between equipment from different vendors and different
    public or private service providers.</p><p>NOTE 1 - PINX in the sense of this
    International Standard is used in the meaning of a PINX directly attached to the
    ICN.</p><p>This International Standard is applicable to attached PINXs and Interconnecting
    Networks (ICN).</p><p>This International Standard identifies the necessary or
    optional employment of particular functions, procedures and services</p><p>when
    provided:</p><p>- physical and electrical characteristics (physical layer) of
    the interfaces to the transmission systems to be employed;</p><p>- data link layer
    procedures;</p><p>- network layer procedures; and</p><p>- supplementary services
    and additional network features to meet specific corporate network user requirements.</p><p>This
    International Standard states requirements upon attached PINXs and Interconnecting
    Network (ICN) implementations in</p><p>order to achieve interoperability between
    equipment in PISNs serving as Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs).</p><p>NOTE
    2 - Implementation of this International Standard does not preclude a manufacturer
    from offering other means of interconnection. It</p><p>also does not preclude
    a VPN service provider to offer basic call communications between a PINX and other
    networks like PSTN or ISDN.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 14475 specifies various access arrangements
    between a PINX and a public network where reference points C and</p><p>T reside
    either at a single or at separate interfaces. The scope of this International
    Standard is limited to cover the C reference</p><p>point aspects at a separate
    interface.</p><p>The current version of this International Standard does not intend
    to specify any gateway or end PINX requirements for the ICN</p><p>side of the
    interface. Therefore it typically uses the term "virtual transit PINX" instead
    of Interconnecting Network (ICN).</p>
