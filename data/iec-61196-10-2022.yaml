  content: "IEC 61196-10:2022 specifies the materials and cable construction for semi-rigid
    coaxial communication cables with fluoropolymer dielectric, IEC type designation,
    identification, marking and labelling, standard rating and characteristics, requirements
    of finished cables, quality assessment, delivery and storage, etc. This part of
    IEC 61196 applies to semi-rigid coaxial communication cables with fluoropolymer
    dielectric and tubular outer conductor. Semi-rigid coaxial communication cables
    with fluoropolymer dielectric are widely used in mobile communication systems,
    microwave test equipment, radar, aerospace and other fields.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na. Title was changed to: Sectional specification for semi-rigid
    cables with fluoropolymer dielectric\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">b. Dielectric:
    other fluoropolymer materials (such as FEP, PFA) were added</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">c. Table 1 – Distinguishing number was added</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">d. Table 2 – Rated temperature was added</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">e. 7.4.8, Thermal cycling was deleted</div>\r\n\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">f. Annex A: Performance requirements of typical cables
    was added</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">g. Annex B: Requirements
    for thermal shock was added</div>"
