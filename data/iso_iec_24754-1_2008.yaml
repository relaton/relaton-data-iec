abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24754:2008 provides the minimum requirements for specifying
    document rendering systems.</p><p>It can apply to the document processing environment,
    where a document is given in a logically structured format which is expressed
    by a structure markup language, and the visual representation of the document
    is described by means of the external style and layout specifications which a
    style and layout specifications language provides. The visual representation of
    the given document is generated when the style and layout specifications are applied
    to the logical structure by a document rendering system.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24754:2008
    provides an abstract list of the features that a rendering system for an authored
    document may have. The list provides a frame of reference, against which the user
    and implementor can compare the features of document rendering systems. However,
    ISO/IEC 24754:2008 does not specify a concrete interchange syntax or direct how
    each document rendering system shall behave.</p><p>It provides the minimum requirements
    to specify the features that a document rendering system which transforms formatting
    objects to rendering output. It may be used as a frame of reference, against which
    the user, implementer, or software agent may compare the features of a document
    rendering system. According to these requirements, the user may express what they
    expect of a document rendering system, the implementer may describe the functionality
    and capability of the document rendering system that they implement, and the software
    agent may negotiate a minimum set of functionality and capability that are shared
    across different document rendering system implementations.</p>"
