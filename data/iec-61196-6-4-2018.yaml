  content: "IEC 61196-6-4:2018(E) applies to coaxial communication cables described
    in IEC 61196-6. It specifies the requirements for 75-7 type CATV drop cables.
    These cables are used in CATV distribution systems, surveillance and control systems,
    satellite television receiving systems and as bidirectional hybrid fibre coax
    (HFC). The operating frequency is from 5 MHz to 3 000 MHz.<br />\r\nThis part
    of IEC 61196 is to be used in conjunction with IEC 61196-1:2005 and IEC 61196
    6:2009. It determines the layout and style with respect to the model and type."
