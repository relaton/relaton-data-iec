  content: "IEC/TS 62600-100:2012(E) provides a method for assessing the electrical
    power production performance of a Wave Energy Converter (WEC), based on the performance
    at a testing site. Provides a systematic method which includes:<br />\r\n- measurement
    of WEC power output in a range of sea states;<br />\r\n- WEC power matrix development;<br
    />\r\n- an agreed framework for reporting the results of power and wave measurements.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of April 2017 have been included in this
    copy."
