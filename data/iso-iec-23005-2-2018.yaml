    <p>The technologies of this document specified are:</p>
    <p>—          description languages and vocabularies to characterize devices and users;</p>
    <p>—          control information to fine tune the sensed information and the actuator command for the control of virtual/real worlds, i.e., user's actuation preference information, user's sensor preference information, actuator capability description, and sensor capability description</p>
    <p>The adaptation engine is not within the scope of this document.</p>
    <p>This document specifies syntax and semantics of the tools required to provide interoperability in controlling devices (actuators and sensors) in real as well as virtual worlds: </p>
    <p>—          Control Information Description Language (CIDL) as an XML schema-based language which enables one to describe a basic structure of control information. </p>
    <p>—          Device Capability Description Vocabulary (DCDV), an XML representation for describing capabilities of actuators such as lamps, fans, vibrators, motion chairs, scent generators, etc. </p>
    <p>—          Sensor Capability Description Vocabulary (SCDV), interfaces for describing capabilities of sensors such as a light sensor, a temperature sensor, a velocity sensor, a global position sensor, an intelligent camera sensor, etc. </p>
    <p>—          Sensory Effect Preference Vocabulary (SEPV), interfaces for describing preferences of individual user on specific sensorial effects such as light, wind, scent, vibration, etc. </p>
    <p>—          Sensor Adaptation Preference Vocabulary (SAPV), interfaces for describing preferences on a sensor of an individual user on each type of sensed information.</p>
