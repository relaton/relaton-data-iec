abstract:
- content: "IEC GUIDE 121:2023 specifies principles, requirements, and guidance for
    standard writers to identify whether an assessment method in their standard can
    be used to obtain an indication of the environmental performance of a product
    and to ensure that such assessment is credible.<br />\r\nThis Guide applies to
    standards covering environmental performance of new products and as appropriate
    to standards covering environmental performance of second life products (e.g.,
    refurbished or remanufactured).<br />\r\nThis Guide is therefore intended to ensure
    that assessment methods developed by standard writers are credible. The credibility
    of an environmentally relevant performance assessment method is determined by
    taking into account all the related principles, namely representativeness, measurement
    repeatability, measurement reproducibility, measurement accuracy, cost of testing,
    as well as circumvention.<br />\r\nEnvironmentally relevant performance assessment
    methods can be present in many IEC standards (e.g., standards covering performance
    aspects of products), and not only those focused on the environment. This Guide
    will be applicable to those as well.<br />\r\nThis Guide is not applicable to
    standards containing environmentally relevant performance assessment methods that
    are not assessed by test (e.g., assessment by inspection or simulation). Nor is
    it applicable to other aspects not linked to environment, such as EMC and EMF."
