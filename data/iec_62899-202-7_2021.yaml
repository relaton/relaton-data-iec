abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-202-7:2021(E) provides a test method to measure the peel strength
    of a printed layer on a flexible substrate. This method calls for peeling the
    flexible substrate instead of an additional metal electroplating on the printed
    layer. The method described in this document can be used to compare the peel strengths
    of the printed layers on the same flexible substrate and thickness conditions.
    It can be used when the adhesion between the printed layer and flexible substrate
    is weaker than any other interface between the printed layer and the adhesive,
    the adhesive and the panel.
