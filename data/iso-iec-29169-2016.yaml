    <p>ISO/IEC 29169:2016 aims to define the application of a conformity assessment methodology, based on the existing published ISO/IEC standards and guides, to the process assessment of process quality characteristics and organizational process maturity, performed in accordance with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of process assessment standards,</p>
    <p>Conformity assessment, also known as compliance assessment, is any activity to determine, directly or indirectly, that a process, product, or service meets relevant standards and fulfils relevant requirements. The subject of conformity assessment activities may include testing, inspection or certification.</p>
    <p>Conformity assessment in this International Standard can be performed by various types of bodies that meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17020.</p>
    <p>The term "inspection" as used in ISO/IEC 17020 is synonymous with the term "process assessment" as defined in ISO/IEC 33001 and used throughout the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of standards.</p>
    <p>While a process assessment may be performed solely according to the ISO/IEC 33002 requirements for performing an assessment, performing a process assessment in the context of conformity assessment according to a conformity assessment scheme brings with it additional requirements. Conformity assessment involves a functional approach consisting of a number of stages: selection?determination?review and attestation, plus surveillance when there is a need to provide continuing assurance of conformity.</p>
