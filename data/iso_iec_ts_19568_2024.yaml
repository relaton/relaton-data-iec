abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoNormal">This document describes extensions to the C++ Standard
    Library (2). These extensions are classes and functions that are likely to be
    used widely within a program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries
    written by different organizations.</p><p class="MsoNormal">It is intended that
    some of the library components be considered for standardization in a future version
    of C++. At present, they are not part of any C++ standard.</p><p class="MsoNormal">The
    goal of this document is to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded
    C++ standard library. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish
    to provide them.</p>
