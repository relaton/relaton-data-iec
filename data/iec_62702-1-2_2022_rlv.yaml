abstract:
- content: "IEC 62702-1-2:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62702-1-2:2022
    specifies a method of data-quality assurance for writable BD disks (hereafter
    referred to as \"disks\") which are specified for long-term data storage, and
    a data migration method which can sustain the recorded data on disks for long-term
    audio data preservation. The writable disks include BD recordable disk and BD
    rewritable disk. IEC 62702-1-2:2022 cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. In order to reflect the
    updates to ISO/IEC 29121:2021, this edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) ISO/IEC 16963
    has been identified as the referee test method for the estimation of lifetime;<br
    />\r\nb) the ambient conditions for the measurement of maximum data error have
    been added;<br />\r\nc) the requirements for test drives have been changed considering
    the use condition of users;<br />\r\nd) the requirements for the estimated lifetime
    have been defined more clearly;<br />\r\ne) the requirements for the periodic
    performance test have been defined more clearly."
