abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61980-3:2019 applies to the equipment for the magnetic field wireless
    power transfer (MF-WPT) of electric power from the supply network to electric
    road vehicles for purposes of supplying electric energy to the RESS (rechargeable
    energy storage system) and/or other on-board electrical systems. The MF-WPT system
    operates at standard supply voltages ratings per IEC 60038 up to 1 000 V AC and
    up to 1 500 V DC The power transfer takes place while the electric vehicle (EV)
    is stationary.<br />\r\nThis document also applies to MF-WPT equipment supplied
    from on-site storage systems (e.g. buffer batteries) at standard supply voltages
    ratings per IEC 60038 up to 1 000 V AC and up to 1 500 V DC.<br />\r\nThe aspects
    covered in this document include<br />\r\n– the characteristics and operating
    conditions,<br />\r\n– the required level of electrical safety,<br />\r\n– requirements
    for basic communication for safety and process matters if required by a MF-WPT
    system,<br />\r\n– requirements for positioning to assure efficient and safe MF-WPT
    power transfer, and<br />\r\n– specific EMC requirements for MF-WPT systems.<br
    />\r\nThe following aspects are under consideration for future documents:<br />\r\n–
    requirements for two- and three-wheel vehicles,<br />\r\n– requirements for MF-WPT
    systems supplying power to EVs in motion, and<br />\r\n– requirements for bidirectional
    power transfer.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– safety aspects
    related to maintenance, and<br />\r\n– trolley buses, rail vehicles and vehicles
    designed primarily for use off-road."
