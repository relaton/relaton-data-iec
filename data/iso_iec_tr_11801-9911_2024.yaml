abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 11801-9911:2024, which is a Technical Report,<br />\r\na) describes
    the rules of implementation of balanced single pair as described by ISO/IEC 11801-6:2017/AMD1:202x
    within a balanced 4- pair cabling system with a current carrying capacity of 0,75
    A per conductor;<br />\r\nb) describes the use of components and cabling to implement
    and configure according to ISO/IEC 11801-6:2017/AMD1:202x<br />\r\nc) describes
    links and components for generic single pair channels according to ISO/IEC 11801-1:2017/AMD1:202x.
    Particular areas of interest are:<br />\r\n• remote powering according to IEEE
    Std 802.3, Clause 104<br />\r\n• loop resistance, max. current<br />\r\n• insertion
    loss<br />\r\n• return loss<br />\r\n• noise considerations<br />\r\n• frequency
    range requirements (low and high)<br />\r\n• length calculation of the SCP-Link-4-pair-cable<br
    />\r\n• number of channels<br />\r\nd) describes the use of application specific
    single pair channels in addition to ISO/IEC 11801:2017/AMD1:202x, 6.6.4<br />\r\ne)
    describes guidance on single pair remote powering applications when using 4-pair
    cabling with current carrying capacity specified<br />\r\nf) describes guidelines
    for planning, administration and installation"
