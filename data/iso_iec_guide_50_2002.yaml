abstract:
- content: This Guide provides a framework for addressing potential sources of unintentional
    physical harm (hazards) to children from products, processes or services that
    they use or with which they may come into contact, even if they are not specifically
    intended for children. The framework aims at minimizing risk of injury to children.It
    is primarily intended for those involved in the preparation and revision of standards.
    However, it has important information that can be useful to, amongst others, designers,
    architects, manufacturers, service providers, communicators and policy makers.For
    children with special needs, additional requirements may be appropriate. This
    Guide does not claim to address those additional requirements in full. ISO/IEC
    Guide 71 addresses the needs of persons with disabilities.A product may include
    goods, structures, buildings, installations or a combination of these.No specific
    guidance is given in this Guide for the prevention or reduction of psychological
    or moral harm or of intentional injuries.
