  content: "Service businesses exist to supply their customers with intangible benefits
    such as providing amenities, facilities, or advice. Perhaps to an even greater
    extent than physical goods, success in the service sector means understanding
    and meeting your customers’ expectations. But, in a fast-paced, digital world,
    these expecta-tions constantly change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nISO has created a practical
    guide on how to manage services in today’s dynamic service environment using ISO/IEC
    20000-1:2018. Additionally, it also describes how to incorporate popular management
    methods (such as Agile, Lean or DevOps), service management frameworks and methodologies
    (ITIL®, COBIT®, CMMI-SVC®), and additional standards (ISO 9001, ISO/IEC 27001,
    ISO 31000) into the IT service management system."
