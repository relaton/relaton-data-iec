    <p>ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008 prescribes methods for technology and scenario evaluations of multi-supplier biometric systems that use biometric data conforming to biometric data interchange format standards.</p>
    <p>It specifies requirements needed to assess</p>
    <ul>
    <li>performance available from samples formatted according to a standard interchange format (SIF),</li>
    <li>performance available when samples formatted according to a SIF are exchanged,</li>
    <li>performance available from samples formatted according to a SIF, relative to proprietary data formats,</li>
    <li>SIF interoperability by quantifying cross-product performance relative to single-product performance,</li>
    <li>performance available from multi-sample and multimodal data formatted according to one or more SIFs, and</li>
    <li>performance interoperability of biometric capture devices.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition, ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008</p>
    <ul>
    <li>includes procedures for establishing an interoperable set of implementations,</li>
    <li>defines procedures for testing interoperability with previously established sets of implementations, and</li>
    <li>gives testing procedures for the measurement of interoperable performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It does not</p>
    <ul>
    <li>establish a conformance test for biometric data interchange formats, or</li>
    <li>provide test procedures for online data collection.</li>
    </ul>
