abstract:
- content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314, is intended
    for use in a high-performance general purpose multi-node network and is designed
    for efficient operation with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token
    Ring architecture with optical fibre as the transmission medium. FDDI provides
    for hundreds of nodes operating over an extent of tens of kilometres. The Media
    Access Control (MAC) specifies the lower sublayer of the Data Link Layer for the
    FDDI. As such, it presents the specifications and services provided for conforming
    FDDI attachment devices. MAC specifies the access to the medium, including addressing,
    data checking, and data framing. MAC also specifies the receiver and transmitter
    state machines. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314 for MAC-2 is an enhancement to
    the original FDDI standard on MAC (ISO 9314-2).
