abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 10373-3:2010 defines test methods for characteristics of integrated
    circuit cards with contacts and related interface devices according to the definition
    given in ISO/IEC 7816. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base
    standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary International
    Standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification
    card applications.ISO/IEC 10373-3:2010 defines test methods which are specific
    to integrated circuit technology with contacts. ISO/IEC 10373-1 defines test methods
    which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts define other
    technology‑specific tests.Test methods defined in ISO/IEC 10373-3:2010 are intended
    to be performed separately and independently. A given card is not required to
    pass through all the tests sequentially. The test methods defined in ISO/IEC 10373-3:2010
    are based on ISO/IEC 7816-3.Conformance of cards and IFDs determined using the
    test methods defined in ISO/IEC 10373-3:2010 does not preclude failures in the
    field. Reliability testing is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 10373-3:2010.ISO/IEC
    10373-3:2010 does not define any test to establish the complete functioning of
    integrated circuit cards. The test methods require only that the minimum functionality
    be verified. Minimum functionality is defined as follows.Any integrated circuit
    present in the card continues to show an Answer to Reset response which conforms
    to the base standard.Any contacts associated with any integrated circuit present
    in the card continue to show electrical resistance which conforms to the base
    standard.
