abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies syntax and semantics of the data formats for
    interaction devices by providing a standardized format for interfacing actuators
    and sensors by defining XML schema-based language named Interaction Information
    Description Language (IIDL). IIDL provides a basic structure with common information
    for communication with various actuators and sensors in consistency. Device Command
    Vocabulary (DCV) is defined to provide a standardized format for commanding individual
    actuator, and Sensed Information Vocabulary (SIV) is defined to provide a standardized
    format for holding information from individual sensors either to get environmental
    information from real world or to influence virtual world objects using the acquired
    information on the basis of IIDL.</p>"
