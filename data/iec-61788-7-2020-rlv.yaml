  content: "IEC 61788-7:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61788-7:2020 describes
    measurement of the surface resistance (Rs) of superconductors at microwave frequencies
    by the standard two-resonator method. The object of measurement is the temperature
    dependence of Rs at the resonant frequency. The applicable measurement range of
    Rs for this method is as follows:<br />\r\n- Frequency: 8 GHz < f < 30 GHz<br
    />\r\n- Measurement resolution: 0,01 m Ω at 10 GHz<br />\r\nThe Rs data at the
    measured frequency, and that scaled to 10 GHz, assuming the f 2 rule for comparison,
    is reported. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published
    in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) informative Annex B, relative combined standard uncertainty for surface
    resistance measurement has been added;<br />\r\nb) precision and accuracy statements
    have been converted to uncertainty;<br />\r\nc) reproducibility in surface resistant
    measurement has been added.</p>"
