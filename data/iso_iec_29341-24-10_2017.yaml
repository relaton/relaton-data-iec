abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-24-10:2017 specifies the characteristics of the UPnP
    networked service named WANIPConnection, version 2. This service definition is
    compliant with UPnP Device Architecture 1.0 [1]. It is one component of the Device
    Control Protocol for the UPnP Internet Gateway Device (see [3]).</p><p>This service
    enables a UPnP control point to:</p><p>- configure and control an IP connection
    between a LAN client on one side of an Internet gateway (see [3]) and a WAN host
    on the other side;</p><p>- manage any physical WAN interface?such as DSL or cable?that
    supports an IP connection.</p><p>This service is a required in a WANConnectionDevice
    (see [5]) when the device supports an IP connection.</p>"
