    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-24-10:2017 specifies the characteristics of the UPnP networked service named
    WANIPConnection, version 2. This service definition is compliant with UPnP Device
    Architecture 1.0 [1]. It is one component of the Device Control Protocol for the
    UPnP Internet Gateway Device (see [3]).<br />\r\nThis service enables a UPnP control
    point to:<br />\r\n- configure and control an IP connection between a LAN client
    on one side of an Internet gateway (see [3]) and a WAN host on the other side;<br
    />\r\n- manage any physical WAN interface?such as DSL or cable?that supports an
    IP connection.<br />\r\nThis service is a required in a WANConnectionDevice (see
    [5]) when the device supports an IP connection."
