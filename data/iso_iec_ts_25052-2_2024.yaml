abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines quality measures for quantitatively
    evaluating cloud services quality in terms of characteristics and sub-characteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC TS 25052-1 and is intended to be used together with ISO/IEC
    TS 25052-1.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document contains the following:</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->a
    basic set of quality measures for each characteristic and sub-characteristics;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->an
    explanation of how to apply quality measures to cloud services.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Since
    the quality model defined in ISO/IEC TS 25052-1 is the extension to the existing
    quality models defined in ISO/IEC 25010 to ISO/IEC 25019, it can be used with
    the product quality model, IT service quality model, data quality model, and quality-in-use
    model according to evaluation purposes. For the same reason, the quality measures
    defined in this document can also be used with the quality measures for software
    ICT products, IT services, data, and quality-in-use.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">As
    there are several cloud service categories, this document focuses on the quality
    model of SaaS (software as a service). This document does not address PaaS (platform
    as a service) and IaaS (infrastructure as a service).</p>'
