  content: "IEC TS 60479-2:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TS 60479-2:2017
    describes the effects on the human body when a sinusoidal alternating current
    in the frequency range above 100 Hz passes through it. This document describes
    the effects of current passing through the human body in the form of single and
    multiple successive unidirectional rectangular impulses, sinusoidal impulses and
    impulses resulting from capacitor discharges. This basic safety publication is
    primarily intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards
    in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide
    51."
