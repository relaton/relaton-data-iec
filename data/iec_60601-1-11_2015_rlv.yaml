abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-1-11:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60601-1-11:2015 applies
    to the basic safety and essential performance of medical electrical equipment
    and medical electrical systems for use in the home healthcare environment. It
    applies regardless of whether the medical electrical equipment or medical electrical
    system is intended for use by a lay operator or by trained healthcare personnel.
    The home healthcare environment includes:<br />\r\n- the dwelling place in which
    a patient lives;<br />\r\n- other places where patients are present both indoors
    and outdoors, excluding professional healthcare facility environments where operators
    with medical training are continually available when patients are present.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 60601-1-11,
    published in 2010, and constitutes a technical revision. The most significant
    changes with respect to the previous edition include the following modifications:<br
    />\r\n- correction of test method for relative humidity control at temperatures
    above 35 °C;<br />\r\n- redrafting of subclauses that altered instead of adding
    to the general standard or other collateral standards; and<br />\r\n- harmonizing
    with the changes to the amendments to the general standard and other collateral
    standards."
