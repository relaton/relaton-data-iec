  content: "IEC TR 60695-2-16:2025 specifies the results of the round robin tests
    related to the use of the pyrometer, for the measurement of the glow-wire temperature,
    according to IEC 60695-2-10.<br />\r\nThis Technical Report summarize the objectives
    and the results of a pre-round robin test and two round robin tests, performed
    by the IEC: \"Glow-wire testing: Optimization of the temperature measuring system\".<br
    />\r\nThe outcome of the work conducted by the IEC resulted in a proposal for
    a new Annex in IEC 60695-2-10, describing the minimum technical characteristics
    and usage conditions for the pyrometer, as an alternative temperature measurement
    instrument to the thermocouple."
