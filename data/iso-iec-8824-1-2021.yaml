    <p>This document provides a standard notation called Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) that is used for the definition of data types, values, and constraints on data types.</p>
    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>–      defines a number of simple types, with their tags, and specifies a notation for referencing these types and for specifying values of these types;</p>
    <p>–      defines mechanisms for constructing new types from more basic types, and specifies a notation for defining such types and assigning them tags, and for specifying values of these types;</p>
    <p>–      defines character sets (by reference to other Recommendations and/or International Standards) for use within ASN.1.</p>
    <p>The ASN.1 notation can be applied whenever it is necessary to define the abstract syntax of information.</p>
    <p>The ASN.1 notation is referenced by other standards which define encoding rules for the ASN.1 types.</p>
