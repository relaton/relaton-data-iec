  content: "Specifies the definitions of data element types for electric components
    and materials and the definitions of the component classes. Provides a set of
    uniquely identified data element types with an unambiguously defined meaning,
    a defined value format, and a prescribed value domain for non-quantitative data
    element types.<br />\r\nIEC 61360-4 is now available as a Database Standard IEC
    61360-4 DB. An online version of the IEC 61360-4 DB (Common Data Dictionary -
