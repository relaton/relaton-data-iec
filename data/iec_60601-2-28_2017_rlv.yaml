abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-2-28:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-28:2017
    applies to the basic safety and essential performance of X-ray tube assemblies
    and to components thereof, intended for medical diagnosis and imaging. Where the
    general standard IEC 60601-1 and the collateral standard IEC 60601-1-3 refer to
    me equipment, this is interpreted as X-ray tube assemblies in this particular
    standard. If a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable to
    ME equipment only, or to ME systems only, the title and content of that clause
    or subclause will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies
    both to ME equipment and to ME systems, as relevant. The third edition of this
    particular standard has been prepared to fit IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012
    (the amended third edition of IEC 60601-1), which is referred to as the general
    standard. Apart from the changes related to the amendment of IEC 60601-1, changes
    related to technical improvements are also included."
