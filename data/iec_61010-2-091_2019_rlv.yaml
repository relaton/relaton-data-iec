abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-091:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-091:2019
    specifies particular safety requirements for cabinet X-ray systems, which fall
    under any of categories a), b) or c) below.<br />\r\na) Electrical test and measurement
    equipment<br />\r\nThis is equipment which by electromagnetic means tests, measures,
    indicates or records one or more electrical or physical quantities, also non-measuring
    equipment such as signal generators, measurement standards, power supplies for
    laboratory use, transducers, transmitters, etc.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 This includes
    bench-top power supplies intended to aid a testing or measuring operation on another
    piece of equipment. Power supplies intended to power equipment are within the
    scope of IEC 61558 (see 1.1.2 h)).<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to test
    equipment integrated into manufacturing processes and intended for testing manufactured
    devices.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Manufacturing test equipment is likely to be installed
    adjacent to and interconnected with industrial machinery in this application.<br
    />\r\nb) Electrical industrial process-control equipment<br />\r\nThis is equipment
    which controls one or more output quantities to specific values, with each value
    determined by manual setting, by local or remote programming, or by one or more
    input variables.<br />\r\nc) Electrical laboratory equipment<br />\r\nThis is
    equipment which measures, indicates, monitors, inspects or analyses materials,
    or is used to prepare materials, and includes in vitro diagnostic (IVD) equipment.
    This equipment may also be used in areas other than laboratories; examples include
    selftest IVD equipment to be used in the home and inspection equipment to be used
    to check people or material during transportation. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2012. It constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant changes from the first edition,
    as well as numerous other changes:<br />\r\n- The scope of the document has been
    clarified and limited to equipment up to 500 kV.<br />\r\n- Additional marking
    requirements for X-ray generating assemblies have been added. (5.1)<br />\r\n-
    Requirements for high-voltage cables used in the X-ray assembly have been added.
    (6.5)<br />\r\n- Insulation requirements have been added. (6.7)<br />\r\n- Temperature
    requirements for beam-limiting devices have been added. (10.3)<br />\r\n- Clarification
    has been provided on and, and test methods. (12)<br />\r\n- Requirements for have
    been modified, taking into account functional safety standards. (15)<br />\r\n-
    Requirements for reasonably foreseeable misuse have been clarified. (16)<br />\r\n-
    Risk assessment has been made mandatory for specific aspects. (17)"
