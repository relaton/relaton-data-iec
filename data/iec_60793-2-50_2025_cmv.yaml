abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-2-50:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60793-2-50:2025 edition 7.0 and the previous IEC 60793-2-50:2018
    edition 6.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 86 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-2-50:2025 is applicable to optical fibre categories B-652,
    B-653, B-654, B-655, B‑656 and B-657. A map illustrating the connection of IEC
    designations to ITU-T designations is shown in Table 1. These fibres are used
    or can be incorporated in information transmission equipment and optical fibre
    cables. Three types of requirements apply to these fibres:<br />\r\n- general
    requirements, as defined in IEC 60793-2;<br />\r\n- specific requirements common
    to the class B single-mode fibres covered in this document and which are given
    in Clause 4;<br />\r\n- particular requirements applicable to individual fibre
    categories or specific applications, which are defined in Annex A to Annex F.<br
    />\r\nFor some fibre categories (shown in the relevant family specifications),
    there are sub-categories that are distinguished on the basis of difference in
    transmission attribute specifications. The designations for these sub-categories
    are documented in the individual family specifications. Table 1 shows a map from
    the IEC designations to the ITU-T recommendations.<br />\r\nThis seventh edition
    cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) The addition of a 200
    µm coating nominal outer diameter option for B-654A, B, C fibres in Annex C"
