  content: 'IEC TS 60079-40:2015(E) provides specific requirements for process sealing
    between a flammable process fluid and an electrical system where a failure could
    allow the migration of the process fluid directly into the premises wiring system.
    This document contains requirements for evaluation, construction and testing of
    single process seal equipment, dual process seal equipment, and add-on secondary
    process seals. The requirements of this document do not apply to conduit sealing
    devices, cable glands and other wiring sealing methods addressed in the IEC 60079
    series or other standards. Requirements for basic electrical safety and explosion
    protection are not addressed by this document, but may apply to the equipment
    under investigation. The effects of leakage to the environment are not addressed
    by this document. Keywords: process sealing between a flammable process fluid
    and an electrical system'
