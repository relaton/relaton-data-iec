    <p>This International Standard specifies the supplementary service Simple Dialog (SS-SD), which is applicable to various basic</p>
    <p>services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>Supplementary service SD enables a user to communicate with another user or application by the exchange of keypad and</p>
    <p>display information transparently over a PISN.</p>
    <p>Service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This International</p>
    <p>Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-SD. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the</p>
    <p>supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) specifies the functional entities involved</p>
    <p>in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>
