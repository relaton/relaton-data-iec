abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-031:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61010-031:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61010-031:2015+AMD1:2018
    CSV edition 2.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 66 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-031:2022 specifies safety requirements for hand-held
    and hand-manipulated probe assemblies for electrical test and measurement, and
    their related accessories. These probe assemblies are for non-contact or direct
    electrical connection between a part and electrical test and measurement equipment.
    They can be fixed to the equipment or be detachable accessories for the equipment.<br
    /><br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with
    IEC Guide 104.<br /><br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2015, and Amendment 1:2018. IEC 61010-031 is a stand-alone
    standard. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tthe scope has been made succinct. General
    information from the scope of Edition 2 has been moved to a new Clause 4. Consequently,
    Clause 4 to Clause 8 of Edition 2 have been renumbered. Clause 9 of Edition 2
    has been deleted;\r\n\tin Clause 2, normative references have been dated and new
    normative references have been added;\r\n\tin 3.1.4, the definition of probe tip
    has been modified;\r\n\tin 4.1, there is no longer any differentiation between
    high voltage and low voltage probe assemblies. Type C probe assemblies have been
    merged with Type B probe assemblies;\r\n\tin 4.1 d) \"Kelvin\" probes have been
    added to the list of probe assemblies as a new Type E and a new Figure 5;\r\n\tin
    4.1 e), probes for voltage measurement without electrical connection to conductors
    have been added to the list of probe assemblies as a new Type F and a new Figure
    6;\r\n\tin 4.2.1, spread of fire is no longer considered as a hazard;\r\n\tSubclause
    4.4.2.5 from Edition 2 has been deleted;\r\n\tSubclause 4.4.4.3 from Edition 2
    has been deleted;\r\n\tin 5.4.4.1 consideration has been given to spacings and
    impedance;\r\n\tin 6.1.1, removable parts of probe tips which bear markings are
    allowed;\r\n\tin 6.1.5, the voltage to be marked for measurement categories is
    the AC line-to-neutral or DC voltage;\r\n\tin 7.4.2, requirements for unmated
    connectors have been modified as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTable 2 has been modified
    and expanded,\r\n\t\ta calculation method for clearances of connectors above 20
    kV has been defined,\r\n\t\tcreepage distances have been aligned with clearances;\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tin
    7.4.3.1 and 7.4.3.5, requirements for IP2X probe tips with retractable sleeve
    have been added;\r\n\tin 7.4.3.2, Probe tips are now applicable to non-contact
    probe assemblies;\r\n\tin 7.5.2.3.2, the values of Table 5 have been modified;\r\n\tin
    7.6.2, voltage tests of clearances are done without humidity preconditioning;\r\n\tpre-treatments
    for rigidity test from Clause 10 of Edition 2 have been moved to 9.2;\r\n\tSubclause
    11.1 of Edition 2 has been deleted;\r\n\taddition of an exception for Type E probe
    assembly in 13.2. Removable parts of probe tips which bear markings are allowed;\r\n\tFigure
    F.1 has been modified;\r\n\tAnnex G has been added, for determination of clearances
    for Table 2<strong>;</strong>\r\n\tAnnex H has been added, covering line-to-neutral
    voltages for common mains supply systems."
