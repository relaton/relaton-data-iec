  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 20748-2:2017 specifies system requirements for learning
    analytics systems and services. Learning analytics systems and services are assumed
    to be composed of independent processes and applications having diverse purposes.
    To improve efficiency for communication and operation between systems and/or services,
    the system requirements identify each system's role, capability and recommended
    performance, etc. The system requirements are based on ISO/IEC TR 20748‑1 and
    additional use cases came from the National Bodies and Liaison Organizations (NBLOs).</p>"
