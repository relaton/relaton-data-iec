abstract:
- content: This document specifies a framework for translation between OCF devices
    and other ecosystems, and specifies the behaviour of a translator that exposes
    AllJoyn producer applications to OCF clients, and exposes OCF servers to AllJoyn
    consumer applications. Translation of specific AllJoyn interfaces to or from specific
    OCF resource types is left to other specifications. Translation of protocols other
    than AllJoyn is left to a future version of this specification. This document
    provides generic requirements that apply unless overridden by a more specific
    document.
