    ISO/IEC 13818-1:2013 specifies the system layer of the coding. It was developed principally to support the combination of the video and audio coding methods defined in ISO/IEC 13818-2 and ISO/IEC 13818-3. The system layer supports six basic functions:
    1) the synchronization of multiple compressed streams on decoding;
    2) the interleaving of multiple compressed streams into a single stream;
    3) the initialization of buffering for decoding start up;
    4) continuous buffer management;
    5) time identification;
    6) multiplexing and signalling of various components in a system stream.
