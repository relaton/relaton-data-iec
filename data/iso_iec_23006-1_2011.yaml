abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 23006-1:2011 specifies the MXM Architecture and references the
    technologies that are part of MXM. The architecture comprises a set of MXM Engines
    for which application programming interfaces (APIs) are defined, on top of which
    applications can be developed. The current list of MXM Engines includes functionalities
    for content creation/search, adaptation, streaming/delivery, domain management,
    IPMP, rights expression, licensing, metadata, event reporting, security, etc.
    The Orchestrator Engine plays a special role, providing access to higher-level
    functionalities by implementing common scenarios utilizing various MXM Engines
    in a pre-defined way (e.g. adaptation of content according to the usage context).
    In order to enable interoperable communication between MXM devices, ISO/IEC 23006-1:2011
    defines MXM protocols. Only the payload format is specified, which is XML-based
    and can be delivered using any suitable transport protocol (e.g. HTML, Web Services).</p><p>The
    elements of the MXM Architecture are as follows:</p><ul><li>MXM Engines, collections
    of specific technologies that it is meaningful to bundle together;</li><li>MXM
    Engine APIs, APIs that can be used to access MXM Engine functionality;</li><li>Orchestrator
    Engine, a special MXM Engine capable of creating chains of MXM Engines to execute
    a high-level application call such as "Play";</li><li>MXM Orchestrator Engine
    APIs;</li><li>MXM Device, a device equipped with MXM;</li><li>MXM Application,
    an application that runs on an MXM Device and makes calls to the MXM Application
    API and MXM Engine APIs;</li><li>MXM protocols for MXM to MXM communications.</li></ul>
