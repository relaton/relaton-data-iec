abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides the common distributed application
    protocol (CDAP) specification. CDAP enables distributed applications to deal with
    communications at an object level, rather than forcing applications to explicitly
    deal with serialization and input/output operations. CDAP provides the application
    protocol component of a distributed application facility (DAF). CDAP provides
    a straightforward and unifying approach to sharing data over a network without
    having to create specialized protocols.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
