abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63233-2:2023 At present, several standards organizations around
    the world are developing standards for smart cities, but they focus on different
    aspects of cities. Because a smart city needs a long-term investment, it should
    provide stakeholders with many standard views with different perspectives as the
    basis for future investments.<br />\r\nThis document is Part 2 of the IEC SRD
    63233 series on smart city standards inventory and mapping. Part 1 provides the
    methodology for inventory and mapping of standards. Part 4 providing guidance
    on standards for public health emergencies, and Part 3 designed as a standards
    map are under development.<br />\r\nThis document provides a catalogue of the
    identified standards related to the smart city system according to the criteria
    specified in IEC SRD 63233-1. This catalogue, as a database or inventory, can
    provide users with a function to search the smart city-related standard information
    with the hyperlinks to the searched standards. The inventory of Smart City standards
    includes not only the existing standards but also those under development officially
    registered in standards development organizations (SDOs). The inventory is comprehensive,
    and it provides an overview of each standard catalogued. The users (e.g. designers
    and implementers of smart cities) can use this inventory to select an appropriate
    set of standards for their design and implementations. The standards inventory
    is available online. It will be maintained and updated regularly."
