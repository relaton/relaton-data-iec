abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62600-201:2015(E) establishes a system for analysing and reporting,
    through estimation or direct measurement, the theoretical tidal current energy
    resource in oceanic areas including estuaries (to the limit of tidal influence)
    that may be suitable for the installation of arrays of Tidal Energy Converters
    (TECs). It is intended to be applied at various stages of project lifecycle to
    provide suitably accurate estimates of the tidal resource to enable the arrays'
    projected annual energy production to be calculated at each TEC location in conjunction
    with IEC 62600-200.
