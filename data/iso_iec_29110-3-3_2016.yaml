abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29110-3-3:2016 contains the requirements for certification
    bodies performing conformity assessments, of the requirements contained in VSE
    profile specifications (e.g. ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 for VSE software basic profile),
    using process assessments and maturity models. This document is based on published
    ISO/IEC standards and guides for</p><p>a) certification bodies (see ISO/IEC 17065)</p><p>b)
    the process assessment and organizational process maturity performed according
    to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of process assessment
    standards, and</p><p>c) based on ISO/IEC 29169 to support an environment which
    encourages worldwide recognition of VSE profiles conformity assessment results.</p><p>The
    overall framework for conformity assessment follows the approach defined in ISO/IEC
    17065:2012.</p><p>This document has been developed following practical use and
    in consultation with key stakeholders, national accreditation bodies, and ISO's
    policy committee for conformity assessment (CASCO).</p><p>ISO/IEC 29110-3-3:2016
    is addressed to people and certification bodies who have a direct relationship
    with the assessment process based on the VSE profiles.</p><p>It is intended that
    ISO/IEC/TR 29110‑1, ISO/IEC 29110‑2-1 and ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 (containing VSE profile
    specifications) be read first when investigating the possibility of conducting
    VSE profile certification.</p><p>NOTE Any clause with requirements directly copied
    from other standards has those copied requirements marked up in a box. Other requirements
    which are also copied but for which information is added are not marked up in
    a box but their source is clearly referenced in the text.</p>"
