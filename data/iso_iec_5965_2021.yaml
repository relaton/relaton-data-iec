abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the Swordfish Scalable Storage Management API.</p><p>Swordfish
    extends the Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API Specification, as defined
    by ISO 30115. It defines a comprehensive, RESTful API for storage management that
    addresses block storage, file systems, object storage, and storage network infrastructure.
    It is centered around common operational and business concerns of storage management,
    including:</p><ul><li>Configuration and provisioning</li><li>Monitoring</li><li>Event
    and log management</li><li>Performance assessment</li><li>Diagnostics</li><li>Fault
    detection and remediation</li><li>Security</li><li>Accounting and resource consumption</li></ul><p>Swordfishâ€™s
    storage model is built around well-defined classes of service, which provide a
    means to map high-level business goals and objectives to specific, storage-based
    actions and requirements, in a clear and consistent way that can be applied uniformly
    across a broad spectrum of storage configurations and storage types (e.g., block
    storage, file systems, object stores). Common storage management functionality
    covered by class of service includes snapshots, replication, mapping and masking,
    and provisioning.</p><p>The Redfish specification provides the protocols and a
    core set of data models and behaviors for the management of systems. It defines
    the elements and behaviors that are mandatory for all Redfish implementations.
    Additionally it defines additional elements and behaviors that can be chosen by
    system vendors or manufacturers. The specifications also defines points at which
    OEM (system vendor) extensions can be provided by a given implementation. The
    specifications specifies normative requirements for Redfish Services and associated
    materials, such as Redfish Schema files. The Redfish specifications does not set
    requirements for Redfish clients, but willindicate what a Redfish client should
    do in order to access and utilize a Redfish Service successfully and effectively.</p><p>The
    Swordfish specification defines additional data models and behaviors for the management
    of storage systems and storage infrastructure. A Swordfish implementation shall
    conform to all requirements specified in the Redfish specifications.</p><p>Swordfish
    is suitable for a wide range of storage, from small-scale object drives, integrated
    RAID cards or RBODs providing storage services, to external disk arrays or file
    servers, to infrastructure providing storage services for converged, hyperscale
    and large scale cloud environments.</p>"
