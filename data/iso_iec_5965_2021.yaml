- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    5965:2021 This document defines the Swordfish Scalable Storage Management API.<br
    />\r\nSwordfish extends the Redfish Scalable Platforms Management API Specification,
    as defined by ISO 30115. It defines a comprehensive, RESTful API for storage management
    that addresses block storage, file systems, object storage, and storage network
    infrastructure. It is centered around common operational and business concerns
    of storage management, including:<br />\r\n- Configuration and provisioning<br
    />\r\n- Monitoring<br />\r\n- Event and log management<br />\r\n- Performance
    assessment<br />\r\n- Diagnostics<br />\r\n- Fault detection and remediation<br
    />\r\n- Security<br />\r\n- Accounting and resource consumption<br />\r\nSwordfishâ€™s
    storage model is built around well-defined classes of service, which provide a
    means to map high-level business goals and objectives to specific, storage-based
    actions and requirements, in a clear and consistent way that can be applied uniformly
    across a broad spectrum of storage configurations and storage types (e.g., block
    storage, file systems, object stores). Common storage management functionality
    covered by class of service includes snapshots, replication, mapping and masking,
    and provisioning.<br />\r\nThe Redfish specification provides the protocols and
    a core set of data models and behaviors for the management of systems. It defines
    the elements and behaviors that are mandatory for all Redfish implementations.
    Additionally it defines additional elements and behaviors that can be chosen by
    system vendors or manufacturers. The specifications also defines points at which
    OEM (system vendor) extensions can be provided by a given implementation. The
    specifications specifies normative requirements for Redfish Services and associated
    materials, such as Redfish Schema files. The Redfish specifications does not set
    requirements for Redfish clients, but willindicate what a Redfish client should
    do in order to access and utilize a Redfish Service successfully and effectively.<br
    />\r\nThe Swordfish specification defines additional data models and behaviors
    for the management of storage systems and storage infrastructure. A Swordfish
    implementation shall conform to all requirements specified in the Redfish specifications.<br
    />\r\nSwordfish is suitable for a wide range of storage, from small-scale object
    drives, integrated RAID cards or RBODs providing storage services, to external
    disk arrays or file servers, to infrastructure providing storage services for
    converged, hyperscale and large scale cloud environments."
