abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-20-14:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [14].
    It defines a service type referred to herein as ScheduledRecording service.<br
    />\r\nThe ScheduledRecording service is a UPnP service that allows control points
    to schedule the recording of content. Generally, this content is broadcast content,
    but this specification does not limit itself to broadcast content. This service
    type enables the following functions:<br />\r\n- Create a recordSchedule so that
    it is added to the list of recordSchedule instances. Each recordSchedule describes
    user-level recording instructions for the ScheduledRecording service.<br />\r\n-
    Browse a list of recordSchedule instances stored by the ScheduledRecording service.<br
    />\r\n- Delete a recordSchedule so that it is removed from the list of recordSchedule
    instances.<br />\r\n- Browse a list of recordTask instances, stored by the ScheduledRecording
    service. The ScheduledRecording service may create zero or more recordTask instances
    for each recordSchedule. A recordTask represents a discrete recording operation
    of a recordSchedule.<br />\r\n- Enable or disable individual recordTask instances.<br
    />\r\n- Enable or disable a recordSchedule.<br />\r\n- Receive notifications i
    ndicating change of recordSchedule or recordTask list.<br />\r\nThe ScheduledRecording
    service does not require a dependency on any UPnP services other than a co-located
    ContentDirectory service, which provides the following functions:<br />\r\n- A
    ContentDirectory service provides channel line-up to allow users to find recordable
    channels. A control point may use this metadata when creating a recordSchedule
    on a ScheduledRecording service.<br />\r\n- A ContentDirectory service may provide
    Electronic Program Guide (EPG) features to allow users to find recordable content.
    A control point may use this metadata when creating a recordSchedule on a ScheduledRecording
    service.<br />\r\n- Contents recorded by the ScheduledRecording service may be
    exposed by a ContentDirectory service.<br />\r\nThe architectural relationship
    among the different concepts, defined by the ScheduledRecording service can be
    summarized as follows: A ScheduledRecording service owns a flat (that is: non-nested)
    list of recordSchedule instances, meaning that the ScheduledRecording service
    may create, destroy, or change recordSchedule instances. A recordSchedule represents
    user-level instructions to perform recording operations. Generally, a user constructs
    his instructions to a ScheduledRecording service via a control point that invokes
    UPnP actions that affect the list of recordSchedule instances. In all cases, the
    ScheduledRecording service shall be able to describe discrete recording operations
    for a recordSchedule through a list of associated recordTask instances. A recordTask
    can only exist with a recordSchedule (that is: never orphaned). Thus when a recordTask
    is created by the ScheduledRecording service, its lifetime depends on its parent
    recordSchedule. An individual recordTask can be selectively enabled or disabled.<br
    />\r\nThis service template does not address:<br />\r\nImplementations where the
    ScheduledRecording service and its associated ContentDirectory service are not
    co-located in the same device."
