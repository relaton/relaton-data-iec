abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14888 specifies digital signature with appendix. As no part
    of the message is recovered from the signature (the recoverable part of the message
    is empty), the signed message consists of the signature and the whole message.</p><p>NOTE
    ISO/IEC 9796 specifies digital signature giving message recovery. As all or part
    of the message is recovered from the signature, the recoverable part of the message
    is not empty. The signed message consists of either the signature only (when the
    non-recoverable part of the message is empty), or both the signature and the non-recoverable
    part.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14888-2:2008 specifies digital signatures with appendix whose
    security is based on the difficulty of factoring the modulus in use. For each
    signature scheme, it specifies:</p><ul><li>the relationships and constraints between
    all the data elements required for signing and verifying;</li><li>a signature
    mechanism, i.e. how to produce a signature of a message with the data elements
    required for signing;</li><li>a verification mechanism, i.e. how to verify a signature
    of a message with the data elements required for verifying.</li></ul><p>The title
    of ISO/IEC 14888-2 has changed from<em>Identity-based mechanisms</em>(first edition)
    to<em>Integer factorization based mechanisms</em>(second edition).</p><ol><li>ISO/IEC
    14888-2:2008 includes the identity-based scheme specified in ISO/IEC 14888-2:1999,
    namely the GQ1 scheme. This scheme has been revised due to the withdrawal of ISO/IEC
    9796:1991 in 1999.</li><li>Among the certificate-based schemes specified in ISO/IEC
    14888-3:1998, it includes all the schemes based on the difficulty of factoring
    the modulus in use, namely, the RSA, RW and ESIGN schemes. These schemes have
    been revised due to the withdrawal of ISO/IEC 9796:1991 in 1999.</li><li>It takes
    into account ISO/IEC 14888-3:1998/Cor.1:2001, technical corrigendum of the ESIGN
    scheme.</li><li>It includes a format mechanism, namely the PSS mechanism, also
    specified in ISO/IEC 9796-2:2002, and details of how to use it in each of the
    RSA, RW, GQ1 and ESIGN schemes.</li><li>It includes new certificate-based schemes
    that use no format mechanism, namely, the GQ2, GPS1 and GPS2 schemes.</li><li>For
    each scheme and its options, as needed, it provides an object identifier.</li></ol>"
