abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14888 specifies digital signature with appendix. As no part of
    the message is recovered from the signature (the recoverable part of the message
    is empty), the signed message consists of the signature and the whole message.NOTE
    ISO/IEC 9796 specifies digital signature giving message recovery. As all or part
    of the message is recovered from the signature, the recoverable part of the message
    is not empty. The signed message consists of either the signature only (when the
    non-recoverable part of the message is empty), or both the signature and the non-recoverable
    part.ISO/IEC 14888-2:2008 specifies digital signatures with appendix whose security
    is based on the difficulty of factoring the modulus in use. For each signature
    scheme, it specifies:the relationships and constraints between all the data elements
    required for signing and verifying;a signature mechanism, i.e. how to produce
    a signature of a message with the data elements required for signing;a verification
    mechanism, i.e. how to verify a signature of a message with the data elements
    required for verifying.The title of ISO/IEC 14888-2 has changed from Identity-based
    mechanisms (first edition) to Integer factorization based mechanisms (second edition).ISO/IEC
    14888-2:2008 includes the identity-based scheme specified in ISO/IEC 14888-2:1999,
    namely the GQ1 scheme. This scheme has been revised due to the withdrawal of ISO/IEC
    9796:1991 in 1999.Among the certificate-based schemes specified in ISO/IEC 14888-3:1998,
    it includes all the schemes based on the difficulty of factoring the modulus in
    use, namely, the RSA, RW and ESIGN schemes. These schemes have been revised due
    to the withdrawal of ISO/IEC 9796:1991 in 1999.It takes into account ISO/IEC 14888-3:1998/Cor.1:2001,
    technical corrigendum of the ESIGN scheme.It includes a format mechanism, namely
    the PSS mechanism, also specified in ISO/IEC 9796-2:2002, and details of how to
    use it in each of the RSA, RW, GQ1 and ESIGN schemes.It includes new certificate-based
    schemes that use no format mechanism, namely, the GQ2, GPS1 and GPS2 schemes.For
    each scheme and its options, as needed, it provides an object identifier.
