    applies to information technology equipment intended to be installed in an outdoor
    location. The requirements for outdoor equipment also apply, where relevant, to
    outdoor enclosures suitable for direct installation in the field and supplied
    for housing information technology equipment to be installed in an outdoor location.
    Each installation may have particular requirements. Some examples are given in
    4.2. In addition, requirements for protection of the outdoor equipment against
    the effects of direct lightning strikes are not covered by the standard. For information
    on this subject, see IEC 62305-1. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2005. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition: More extensive requirements for battery ventilation. Key words: Outdoor
