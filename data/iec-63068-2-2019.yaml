  content: IEC 63068-2:2019(E) provides definitions and guidance in use of optical
    inspection for detecting as-grown defects in commercially available 4H-SiC (Silicon
    Carbide) epitaxial wafers. Additionally, this document exemplifies optical images
    to enable the detection and categorization of the defects for SiC homoepitaxial
    wafers. This document deals with a non-destructive test method for the defects
    so that destructive methods such as preferential etching are out of scope in this
    document.
