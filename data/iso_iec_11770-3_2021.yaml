abstract:
- content: "This document defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric cryptographic
    techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques to achieve
    the following goals.<br />\r\na) Establish a shared secret key for use in a symmetric
    cryptographic technique between two entities A and B by key agreement. In a secret
    key agreement mechanism, the secret key is computed as the result of a data exchange
    between the two entities A and B. Neither of them is able to predetermine the
    value of the shared secret key.<br />\r\nb) Establish a shared secret key for
    use in a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities A and B via key
    transport. In a secret key transport mechanism, the secret key is chosen by one
    entity A and is transferred to another entity B, suitably protected by asymmetric
    techniques.<br />\r\nc) Make an entity's public key available to other entities
    via key transport. In a public key transport mechanism, the public key of entity
    A is transferred to other entities in an authenticated way, but not requiring
    secrecy.<br />\r\nSome of the mechanisms of this document are based on the corresponding
    authentication mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798â€‘3.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover
    certain aspects of key management, such as:<br />\r\n- key lifecycle management;<br
    />\r\n- mechanisms to generate or validate asymmetric key pairs; and<br />\r\n-
    mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy, etc., keys.<br />\r\nWhile this
    document does not explicitly cover the distribution of an entity's private key
    (of an asymmetric key pair) from a trusted third party to a requesting entity,
    the key transport mechanisms described can be used to achieve this. A private
    key can in all cases be distributed with these mechanisms where an existing, non-compromised
    key already exists. However, in practice the distribution of private keys is usually
    a manual process that relies on technological means such as smart cards, etc.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not specify the transformations used in the key management
    mechanisms.<br />\r\nNOTE To provide origin authentication for key management
    messages, it is possible to make provisions for authenticity within the key establishment
    protocol or to use a public key signature system to sign the key exchange messages."
