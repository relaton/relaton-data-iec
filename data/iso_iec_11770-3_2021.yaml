abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric
    cryptographic techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques
    to achieve the following goals.</p><p>a) Establish a shared secret key for use
    in a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em>
    by key agreement. In a secret key agreement mechanism, the secret key is computed
    as the result of a data exchange between the two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em>.
    Neither of them is able to predetermine the value of the shared secret key.</p><p>b)
    Establish a shared secret key for use in a symmetric cryptographic technique between
    two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em> via key transport. In a secret key transport
    mechanism, the secret key is chosen by one entity<em>A</em> and is transferred
    to another entity<em>B</em>, suitably protected by asymmetric techniques.</p><p>c)
    Make an entity's public key available to other entities via key transport. In
    a public key transport mechanism, the public key of entity<em>A</em> is transferred
    to other entities in an authenticated way, but not requiring secrecy.</p><p>Some
    of the mechanisms of this document are based on the corresponding authentication
    mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798‑3.</p><p>This document does not cover certain aspects
    of key management, such as:</p><p>— key lifecycle management;</p><p>— mechanisms
    to generate or validate asymmetric key pairs; and</p><p>— mechanisms to store,
    archive, delete, destroy, etc., keys.</p><p>While this document does not explicitly
    cover the distribution of an entity's private key (of an asymmetric key pair)
    from a trusted third party to a requesting entity, the key transport mechanisms
    described can be used to achieve this. A private key can in all cases be distributed
    with these mechanisms where an existing, non-compromised key already exists. However,
    in practice the distribution of private keys is usually a manual process that
    relies on technological means such as smart cards, etc.</p><p>This document does
    not specify the transformations used in the key management mechanisms.</p><p>NOTE
    To provide origin authentication for key management messages, it is possible to
    make provisions for authenticity within the key establishment protocol or to use
    a public key signature system to sign the key exchange messages.</p>"
