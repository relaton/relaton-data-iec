abstract:
- content: "<p>This recommended practice describes a set of useful quality considerations
    that can be selected and applied during one or more steps in a software acquisition
    process. The recommended practices can be applied to software that runs on any
    computer system regardless of the size, complexity, or criticality of the software.
    The software supply chain may include integration of commercial-off-the-shelf
    (COTS), custom, or free and open source software (FOSS). Each organization or
    individual using this recommended practice will need to identify the specific
    quality and activities that need to be included within the organization's acquisition
    process. Security will be included as a quality attribute considered during the
    acquisition.</p>"
