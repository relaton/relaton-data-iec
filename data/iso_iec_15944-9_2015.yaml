abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-9:2015 presents a framework consisting of several models, including a reference
    model, a model of concepts, a content model, an information model, as well as
    rules, templates and other technical specifications for traceability requirements
    based on internal or external constraints as applicable to a business transaction.
    The internal constraints are imposed in Open-edi due to mutual agreements among
    parties to a business transaction and the external constraints are invoked by
    the nature of a business transaction due to applicable laws, regulations, policies,
    etc. of jurisdictional domains which need to be considered in Open-edi business
    transactions. All requirements in ISO/IEC 15944-9:2015 originate from external
    constraints. However, parties to a business transaction may well by mutual agreement
    apply external constraints of this nature as internal constraints.<br />\r\nThe
    focus therefore of this traceability framework standard is on commitment exchange
    among autonomous parties to a business transaction.<br />\r\nAs such, this statement
    of scope includes the ability of the traceability framework to\r\n\r\n\tspecify
    a group of structured and inter-related concepts pertaining to traceability as
    a legal or regulatory requirement in the Open-edi context, in addition to concepts
    that appear in other Parts of ISO/IEC 15944 these concepts having the characteristics
    of cultural adaptability through the use of multilingual terms and definitions;\r\n\tprovide
    additional specifications for Open-edi scenarios and scenario components from
    the perspective of traceability as required by internal or external constraints
    in business transactions;\r\n\tprovide a more detailed specification for business
    transactions regarding aspects of traceability, including refined models of Person,
    Data and Process in support of the ability for Open-edi to incorporate elements
    or characteristics of traceability in its information bundles (including their
    semantic components) and business processes;\r\n\trealize specifications and descriptions
    from the traceability requirements as rules and guidelines, to provide recommendations
    or guidance on Open-edi practices; and,\r\n\tprovide revised primitive Open-edi
    scenario templates for traceability, integrating the modifications to the template
    from other existing Parts of ISO/IEC 15944.<p>ISO/IEC 15944-9:2015 can be used
    by Open-edi implementers (including business modellers and system designers) and
    Open-edi standard developers in specifying Open-edi scenarios, developing Open-edi
    related standards, and implementing Open-edi rules and guidelines for Open-edi
    activities.</p>"
