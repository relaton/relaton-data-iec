abstract:
- content: applies to all types of surface-mount fluid distribution components with
    elastomeric sealing devices used within process analyzer and sample-handling systems.  This
    includes components such as valves, filters, regulators, transducers, and controllers.addresses
    only surface-mount fluid distribution components and proper sealing methods. It
    is limited to sealing methods using elastomeric material for the seals.
