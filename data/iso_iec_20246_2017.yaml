    a generic framework for work product reviews that can be referenced and used by
    all organizations involved in the management, development, test and maintenance
    of systems and software. It contains a generic process, activities, tasks, review
    techniques and documentation templates that are applied during the review of a
    work product. A work product is any artefact produced by a process. This document
    defines work product reviews that can be used during any phase of the life cycle
    of any work product. This document is intended for, but not limited to, project
    managers, development managers, quality managers, test managers, business analysts,
    developers, testers, customers and all those involved in the development, testing
    and maintenance of systems and software.</p>
