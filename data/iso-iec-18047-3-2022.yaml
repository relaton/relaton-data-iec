    <p>This document defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000‑3. It does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p>
    <p>The test methods intend to verify the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general case.</p>
    <p>This document includes the following interrogator and tag conformance parameters:</p>
    <p>—    mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;</p>
    <p>—    parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</p>
    <p>This document does not include the following:</p>
    <p>—    parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;</p>
    <p>—    high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).</p>
