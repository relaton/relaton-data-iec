abstract:
- content: "NEW! IEC 60826:2017 is available as IEC 60826:2017 RLV which contains
    the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes of the
    technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60826:2017:
    specifies the loading and strength requirements of overhead lines derived from
    reliability-based design principles. These requirements apply to lines 45 kV and
    above, but can also be applied to lines with a lower nominal voltage.<br />\r\nThis
    document also provides a framework for the preparation of national standards dealing
    with overhead transmission lines, using reliability concepts and employing probabilistic
    or semi-probabilistic methods. These national standards will need to establish
    the local climatic data for the use and application of this standard, in addition
    to other data that are country- specific.<br />\r\nAlthough the design criteria
    in this standard apply to new lines, many concepts can be used to address the
    design and reliability requirements for refurbishment, upgrading and uprating
    of existing lines.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover the detailed design of
    line components such as supports, foundations, conductors or insulators strings.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2003. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThe main technical changes
    with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\nThis standard has
    been further simplified by removing many informative annexes and theoretical details
    that can now be found in CIGRE Technical Brochure 178 and referred to as needed
    in the text of the standard. Many revisions have also been made that reflect the
    users experience in the application of this standard, together with information
    about amplification of wind speed due to escarpments. The annexes dealing with
    icing data have also been updated using new work by CIGRE.<br /><br />\r\nKey
    words: Overhead lines, Overhead transmission lines, reliability, energy"
