  content: "IEC 61523-4:2023 defines the syntax and semantics of a format used to
    express power intent in energy-aware electronic system design. Power intent includes
    the concepts and information required for specification and validation, implementation
    and verification, and modeling and analysis of power-managed electronic systems.
    This standard also defines the relationship between the power intent captured
    in this format and design intent captured via other formats (e.g., standard hardware
    description languages and cell libraries). This is an IEC/IEEE dual logo standard.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum 1 (2024-02) have been included in this copy."
