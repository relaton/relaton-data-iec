    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 describes the management architecture and protocol for managing the DAVIC</p>
    <p>System. The DAVIC system management architecture is the TMN-based (Telecommunication Management</p>
    <p>Network) architecture defined in ITU-T Recommendation M.3010. This management architecture allows for</p>
    <p>automatic administration, configuration, monitoring, billing, and maintenance of the Service Provider System, the</p>
    <p>Delivery System, and the Consumer System over the DAVIC S5 flows. In accordance with DAVIC 1.3.1a Part 4</p>
    <p>and ISO/IEC 16500-5, the content of these flows is based on either the CMIP protocol or the SNMP protocol,</p>
    <p>depending on the complexity of the underlying subsystem or the preference of the network provider. SNMP</p>
    <p>MIBs (Management Information Base) for managing the STU and the Server have been defined in ISO/IEC</p>
    <p>16500-5. Usage related information models have also been defined in ISO/IEC 16500-9 using both CMISE and</p>
    <p>SNMP. For managing the ATM, SDH/SONET components of the Core Network of the DAVIC Delivery System,</p>
    <p>CMISE models defined in ITU-T and ATM Forum are recommended in ISO/IEC 16500-5 subclause 10.5.3.</p>
    <p>Taking into account that the current DAVIC specification for the Access Network is ATM-based 1, this Part of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 16500 defines CMISE information models for managing the DAVIC Access Network and servicerelated</p>
    <p>data in the Delivery System. In the future, if DAVIC specifications allow altenative access technologies</p>
    <p>(such as IP-based), additional system management information models (such as SNMP MIB) may be needed. The</p>
    <p>management of the coexistence of different access network technologies, using different protocols, could be</p>
    <p>achieved through interworking tools (i.e., interworking between CMIP and SNMP) as described in subclause 6.4.</p>
    <p>Tutorial information on a protocol-independent modeling technique is also provided in an informative annex.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 is organized as follows:</p>

    <p/>

    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 refers to system architecture and interface information that are described in ISO/IEC</p>
    <p>16500 parts ?1, -5 and ?9 and in DAVIC 1.3.1a Part 4: <i>Delivery system architecture and interface</i>.</p>
