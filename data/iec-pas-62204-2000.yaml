    Aims at determining the temperature coefficient of resistance (at a given reference temperature) of aluminium and aluminium-alloy thin-film metallization that are used in microelectronic circuits and devices.
    This method is intended for estimating a mean temperature of a metallization line stressed in an accelerated electromigration stress test before any irreversible change in resistivity occurs due to the current-density and temperature stresses imposed.
