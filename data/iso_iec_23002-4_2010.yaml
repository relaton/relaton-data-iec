    <p>ISO/IEC 23002-4:2010 defines the description of the MPEG video tool library (VTL) based on the decoder description specified in ISO/IEC 23001-4. This tool library defines the specification of FUs, which are sufficient to build complete decoding solutions according to the following coding standards:</p>

    ISO/IEC 14496-2 (MPEG-4 Simple Profile), and
    ISO/IEC 14496-10<em></em>(MPEG-4 AVC Constrained Baseline Profile).<p>The objective of ISO/IEC 23001-4 is to define the general framework principles, and ISO/IEC 23002-4:2009 defines the MPEG VTL that includes relevant tools (or FUs) from the existing MPEG coding standards. Each FU is defined in the form of a textual description. The conventions for the input and output behavior are also described.</p><p>Implementations compliant with ISO/IEC 23002-4:2009 can be designed using any software or hardware language and components. The reference software for the textual specification of FUs is written in RVC-CAL language of which a formal syntax is provided in ISO/IEC 23001-4, and which will be defined in Amendment 1 to ISO/IEC 23002-4.</p>
