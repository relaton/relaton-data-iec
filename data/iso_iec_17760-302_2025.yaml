abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoNormal">The set of AT Attachment standards consists of this
    document and the ATA implementation standards described in AT Attachment - 8 ATA/ATAPI
    Architecture Model (ATA8-AAM). This document specifies the command set that host
    systems use to access storage devices that implement the Host Aware Zones feature
    set (see 4.3), the Host Managed Zones feature set (see 4.4), the Zone Domains
    feature set (see 4.5), and the Zone Realms feature set (see 4.6). This document
    provides a common command set for systems manufacturers, system integrators, software
    suppliers, and suppliers of storage devices that provide one or more of the zones
    feature sets. Figure 1 shows the relationship of This document to other ATA standards
    as well as related device and host standards and specifications (e.g., SCSI standards
    and SATA-I0 specifications).</p><p class="MsoNormal">This document maintains compatibility
    with the ACS-5 standard, INCITS 558-202x, while providing additional functions.</p>
