abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-7:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 62257-7:2017
    specifies the general requirements for the generators in decentralized rural electrification
    systems. This document is a general introduction followed by more specific documents
    dedicated to the generation technologies which are the most currently used in
    rural electrification projects. This new edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: removed the word \"small\"
    from the description of the PV systems, and removed the power limit (100 kVA);
    increased the relevant voltage levels to 1 000 V (AC) and 1 500 V (DC)."
