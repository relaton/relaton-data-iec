  content: "IEC TS 63157:2019 lays out recommendations for best practices for product
    realization, safety, customer satisfaction, and stakeholders' relationship used
    in the manufacture of power conversion equipment (PCE). This document captures
    key requirements customers would like to see completed to ensure high-quality
    products, specifically, that the products have the documented properties, including
    properties needed to give customer satisfaction with regard to the warranty.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is to provide more confidence in the ongoing
    consistency of performance and reliability of certified power conversion equipment.
    The requirements of this document are defined with the assumption that the quality
    management system of the organization has already fulfilled the requirements of
    ISO 9001 or equivalent quality management system. These guidelines also form the
    basis for factory audit criteria of such sites by various certifying and auditory
    bodies.<br />\r\nThis document covers manufacture of electronic power conversion
    equipment intended for use in terrestrial PV applications. The term PCE refers
    to equipment and components for electronic power conversion of electric power
    into another kind of electric power with respect to voltage, current and frequency.
    This document applies to PCE in both indoor and outdoor open-air climates as defined
    in IEC 60721-2-1 and IEC 60721-3-3. Such equipment may include, but is not limited
    to, DC-to-AC inverters, DC-to-DC converters and battery charge converters."
