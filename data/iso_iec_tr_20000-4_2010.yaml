abstract:
- content: "The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 20000-4:2010 is to facilitate the development
    of a process assessment model according to ISO/IEC 15504 process assessment principles.
    ISO/IEC 15504-1 describes the concepts and terminology used for process assessment.
    ISO/IEC 15504-2 describes the requirements for the conduct of an assessment and
    a measurement scale for assessing process capability.<br /><br />\r\nThe process
    reference model provided in ISO/IEC TR 20000-4:2010 is a logical representation
    of the elements of the processes within service management that can be performed
    at a basic level. Using the reference model in a practical application might require
    additional elements suited to the environment and circumstances.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    process reference model specified in ISO/IEC TR 20000-4:2010 describes at an abstract
    level the processes including the general service management system processes
    implied by ISO/IEC 20000-1. Each process of this process reference model is described
    in terms of a purpose and outcomes. The process reference model does not attempt
    to place the processes in any specific environment nor does it predetermine any
    level of process capability required to achieve the ISO/IEC 20000-1 requirements.
    The process reference model is not intended to be used for a conformity assessment
    audit or process implementation reference guide.<br /><br />\r\nAny organization
    can define processes with additional elements in order to suit it to its specific
    environment and circumstances. The purpose and outcomes described in ISO/IEC TR
    20000-4:2010 are, however, considered to be the minimum necessary to meet ISO/IEC
    20000-1 requirements. Some processes address general strategic aspects of an organization.
    These processes have been identified in order to give coverage to all the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 20000-1.<br /><br />\r\nThe process reference model does not provide
    the evidence required by ISO/IEC 20000-1. The process reference model does not
    specify the interfaces between the processes."
