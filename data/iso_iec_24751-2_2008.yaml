abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    24751-2:2008 provides a common information model for describing the learner or
    user needs and preferences when accessing digitally delivered resources or services.
    This description is one side of a pair of descriptions used in matching user needs
    and preferences with education delivery (as described in ISO/IEC 24751-1).<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 discusses the basic principles adhered to in developing
    this model for describing personal needs and preferences. It explains: the rationale
    for using a functional approach to describing needs, possible methods of creating
    a personal needs and preference statement, the major groupings of needs and preferences
    within the standard, the use of different needs and preferences statements in
    different contexts, how needs and preferences can be ranked with respect to priority,
    and the use of generic and application-specific needs and preference specifications.<br
    />\r\nIt contains the information model for ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008, including the
    attribute, allowed occurrence and datatype of each element. It defines and describes
    how the terms in the information model should be used.<br />\r\nConformance to
    ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 is discussed. Conformance is dependent on the role played
    by the conformant technology. Conformance requirements for both education delivery
    applications and alternative access systems are explained.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 24751-2:2008
    provides<br />\r\na consolidated list of all the terms defined in ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008,
    sorted in French alphabetical order,<br />\r\nthe ISO French language equivalent
    terms and definitions, and<br />\r\nthe codes representing the gender of the French
    terms.<br />\r\nThe vocabulary codes, values and associated rules of application
    are defined. An informative list of recommended default values for the learner
    preferences and needs is provided.<br />\r\nIt lists existing bindings of the
    IMS Learner Information Package Accessibility for LIP - Version 1 [ACCLIP] that
    serves as the reference specification for ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008.<br />\r\nIt describes
    information scenarios for applying ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 and gives informative
    implementation examples.<br />\r\nUse of ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 will assist in matching
    individual learner needs in a computer mediated learning environment with the
    necessary user interface and resources needed to meet those needs."
