    <p>Thin flexible cards are used to automate the controls for access to goods or services such as mass transit, highway toll systems, car parks, vouchers and stored value.</p>
    <p>For these applications, data can be written and/or read by machines using various recording techniques: magnetic stripe, optical character recognition, bar code, etc.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15457-2:2007 specifies the magnetic stripe and encoding characteristics of thin flexible cards at two points in the card's life cycle:</p>
    <ul><li>at the point of loading into the card-issuing equipment;</li><li>at the point of issue to the public.</li></ul>
