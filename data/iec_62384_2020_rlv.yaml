abstract:
- content: "IEC 62384:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62384:2020 specifies performance
    requirements for electronic controlgear for use on DC or AC supplies up to 1 000
    V (alternating current at 50 Hz or 60 Hz) and with an output frequency which can
    deviate from the supply frequency, associated with LED modules according to IEC
    62031. Controlgear for LED modules specified in this document are designed to
    provide constant voltage or current. Deviations from the pure voltage and current
    types do not exclude the gear from this document. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2006 and Amendment 1:2009. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- scope extension
    (direct current from 250 V to 1 000 V);<br />\r\n- new specifications for measuring
    the power factor for controlgear with settable/non-constant output (for instance,
    to allow for constant light output);<br />\r\n- deletion of audio frequency requirements;<br
    />\r\n- selection of current test circuit by module capacitance (instead of selecting
    by having or not having logic circuitry) plus test circuit setup changes.</p><ol
