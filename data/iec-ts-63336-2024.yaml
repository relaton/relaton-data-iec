  content: "IEC TS 63336:2024, which is a technical specification, applies to the
    commissioning of voltage-sourced converter (VSC) high voltage direct current (HVDC)
    systems which consist of two converter stations and the connecting HVDC transmission
    line.<br />\r\nThe tests are generally applied to all HVDC configurations and
    could require addition or deletion to match the given solution.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides guidance on the planning of commissioning activities. The commissioning
    described in this document is implemented through on-site testing on the whole
    system functionality, including testing on the subsystem and system. This document
    provides the scope, procedures and acceptance criteria of the tests.<br />\r\nFactory
    system tests, on-site equipment tests, electrode tests, and trial operation are
    not included in this document."
