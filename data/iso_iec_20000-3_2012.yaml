abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20000-3:2012 is useful for service providers, consultants and
    assessors. It includes practical guidance on scope definition, applicability and
    demonstration of conformity to the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1. Guidance on
    the different types of conformity assessment and assessment standards is included.<br
    /><br />\r\nAlthough the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1 do not change with organizational
    structure, technology or service, operating the processes in a particular service
    environment will result in specific skill, tool and information requirements.
    Service management processes can cross many organizational, legal and national
    boundaries as well as different time zones. Service providers can provide a range
    of services to several different types of customers, both internal and external.
    Service providers can also depend on a complex supply chain for the delivery of
    services. This dependency can make the agreement and application of scope a complex
    stage in the service provider's use of ISO/IEC 20000-1.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20000-3:2012 will assist in establishing if ISO/IEC 20000-1 is applicable to a
    service provider's circumstances. It illustrates how the scope of an SMS can be
    defined, irrespective of whether the reader has experience of defining the scope
    of other management systems. The guidance takes the form of practical examples,
    typical scenarios and recommendations.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 20000-3:2012 also
    assists in planning service improvements and in preparation for a conformity assessment
    against ISO/IEC 20000-1. It supplements the guidance on the application of ISO/IEC
    20000-1 given in ISO/IEC 20000-2."
