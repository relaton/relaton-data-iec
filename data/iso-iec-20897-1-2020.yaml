    <p>This document specifies the security requirements for physically unclonable functions (PUFs). Specified security requirements concern the output properties, tamper-resistance and unclonability of a single and a batch of PUFs. Since it depends on the application which security requirements a PUF needs to meet, this documents also describes the typical use cases of a PUF.</p>
    <p>Amongst PUF use cases, random number generation is out of scope in this document.</p>
