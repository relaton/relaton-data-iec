abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 26550:2015 is the entry point of the whole suite of International
    Standards for software and systems product line engineering and management.</p><p>The
    scope of this International Standard is to</p><p>? provide the terms and definitions
    specific to software and systems product line engineering and management,</p><p>?
    define a reference model for the overall structure and processes of software and
    systems product line engineering and management and describe how the components
    of the product line reference model fit together, and</p><p>? define interrelationships
    between the components of the product line reference model.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26550:2015
    does not describe any methods and tools associated with software and systems product
    line engineering and management. Descriptions of such methods and tools will appear
    in the consecutive International Standards (ISO/IEC 26551[1] to ISO/IEC 26556[2]).
    This International Standard does not deal with terms and definitions addressed
    by ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 that provides a common vocabulary applicable to all
    systems and software engineering work.</p><p>Whenever this International Standard
    refers to "products", it means "system-level products" consisting of software
    systems or both hardware and software systems. It may be useful for the engineering
    and management of product lines that consist of only hardware systems but it has
    not been explicitly created to support such hardware product lines. This International
    Standard is not intended to help the engineering, production, warehousing, logistics,
    and management of physical items that, possibly combined with software, comprise
    the products. These processes belong to other disciplines (e.g. mechanics, electronics).</p><p>NOTE
    Annex A provides further information on products.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26550:2015, including
    the product line reference model and the terms and definitions, has been produced
    starting from References [6], [7], and [8] which finally resulted in a broad consensus
    from National Member Bodies at the time of publication. In addition to this background
    process, structures from ISO/IEC 12207:2008, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, ISO/IEC
    15940:2006 and ISO/IEC 14102:2008 have been used as a baseline.</p><p>[1] Second
    edition to be published.</p><p>[2] Under development.</p>
