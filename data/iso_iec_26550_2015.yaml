abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26550:2015 is the entry point of the whole suite of International
    Standards for software and systems product line engineering and management.<br
    />\r\nThe scope of this International Standard is to<br />\r\n- provide the terms
    and definitions specific to software and systems product line engineering and
    management,<br />\r\n- define a reference model for the overall structure and
    processes of software and systems product line engineering and management and
    describe how the components of the product line reference model fit together,
    and<br />\r\n- define interrelationships between the components of the product
    line reference model.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 26550:2015 does not describe any methods
    and tools associated with software and systems product line engineering and management.
    Descriptions of such methods and tools will appear in the consecutive International
    Standards (ISO/IEC 26551[1] to ISO/IEC 26556[2]). This International Standard
    does not deal with terms and definitions addressed by ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010
    that provides a common vocabulary applicable to all systems and software engineering
    work.<br />\r\nWhenever this International Standard refers to \"products\", it
    means \"system-level products\" consisting of software systems or both hardware
    and software systems. It may be useful for the engineering and management of product
    lines that consist of only hardware systems but it has not been explicitly created
    to support such hardware product lines. This International Standard is not intended
    to help the engineering, production, warehousing, logistics, and management of
    physical items that, possibly combined with software, comprise the products. These
    processes belong to other disciplines (e.g. mechanics, electronics).<br />\r\nNOTE
    Annex A provides further information on products.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 26550:2015,
    including the product line reference model and the terms and definitions, has
    been produced starting from References [6], [7], and [8] which finally resulted
    in a broad consensus from National Member Bodies at the time of publication. In
    addition to this background process, structures from ISO/IEC 12207:2008, ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2015, ISO/IEC 15940:2006 and ISO/IEC 14102:2008 have been used as a baseline.<br
    /><br />\r\n[1] Second edition to be published.<br />\r\n[2] Under development."
