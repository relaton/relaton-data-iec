abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 26550:2015 is the entry
    point of the whole suite of International Standards for software and systems product
    line engineering and management.</p><p>The scope of this International Standard
    is to</p><p>? provide the terms and definitions specific to software and systems
    product line engineering and management,</p><p>? define a reference model for
    the overall structure and processes of software and systems product line engineering
    and management and describe how the components of the product line reference model
    fit together, and</p><p>? define interrelationships between the components of
    the product line reference model.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26550:2015 does not describe any
    methods and tools associated with software and systems product line engineering
    and management. Descriptions of such methods and tools will appear in the consecutive
    International Standards (ISO/IEC 26551[1] to ISO/IEC 26556[2]). This International
    Standard does not deal with terms and definitions addressed by ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010
    that provides a common vocabulary applicable to all systems and software engineering
    work.</p><p>Whenever this International Standard refers to "products", it means
    "system-level products" consisting of software systems or both hardware and software
    systems. It may be useful for the engineering and management of product lines
    that consist of only hardware systems but it has not been explicitly created to
    support such hardware product lines. This International Standard is not intended
    to help the engineering, production, warehousing, logistics, and management of
    physical items that, possibly combined with software, comprise the products. These
    processes belong to other disciplines (e.g. mechanics, electronics).</p><p>NOTE
    Annex A provides further information on products.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26550:2015, including
    the product line reference model and the terms and definitions, has been produced
    starting from References [6], [7], and [8] which finally resulted in a broad consensus
    from National Member Bodies at the time of publication. In addition to this background
    process, structures from ISO/IEC 12207:2008, ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, ISO/IEC
    15940:2006 and ISO/IEC 14102:2008 have been used as a baseline.</p><p>[1] Second
    edition to be published.</p><p>[2] Under development.</p>
