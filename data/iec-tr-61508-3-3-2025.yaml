  content: "IEC TR 61508-3-3:2025 makes a proposal as to which topics to consider
    and which methods and techniques to use when designing object-oriented software
    to ensure suitable quality for use in functional safety applications.<br />\r\nObject-oriented
    languages are perceived as \"state-of-the-art\" nowadays. Such languages seem
    to be excluded from use by several statements in IEC 61508-3. However there are
    additions in some tables such as in IEC 61508-3:2010, Table B.1, where notes are
    added under which their use might be justified. Such exceptions that would allow,
    for example, dynamic objects, name the main concerns such as memory allocation
    and predictable timing issues and guide the user to safe use of object-oriented
    languages. These considerations are taken up in this document to specify methods
    and techniques that allow the reduction of systematic faults to the levels required
    by the respective systematic capabilities.<br />\r\nThis document is not intended
    to replace any part of IEC 61508-3. Rules that exist in IEC 61508‑3 are valid
    here as well and are not repeated, including rules that concern:<br />\r\n• the
    software life cycle,<br />\r\n• involvement of the assessor,<br />\r\n• modularization,<br
    />\r\n• principle of information hiding,<br />\r\n• proving and conventional testing,<br
    />\r\n• basic aspects of documentation,<br />\r\n• low coupling and high cohesion,<br
    />\r\n• responsibilities and training of people,<br />\r\n• operational experience
    as described in IEC 61508-4 and IEC 61508-7<br />\r\nThis TR is a supplement to
    the IEC 61508 standard series. It has to be read in conjunction with IEC 61508-3
    and proposes a way how the use of object-oriented software in safety relevant
    applications can be justified."
