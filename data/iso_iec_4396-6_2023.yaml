abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document is a service definition that provides
    an abstract description of the application programming interface (API) seen by
    an Application Process using a distributed inter-process communication (IPC) facility
    (DIF). APIs reflect the specific constraints and conventions of an operating system
    or programming language. This document does not do that. A service definition
    specifies the interactions between an Application Process and IPC independent
    of such specifics.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The application process may be an
    IPC process and the member of a (N+1)-DIF. Actual APIs will be system specific
    (or may not exist at all), but this sequence of interaction will be maintained.
    The notation here is used to emphasize that the participants can only act on what
    they see and must not make assumptions about any events that may have occurred
    elsewhere. Hence the primitives are described in terms of primitives invoked locally
    to cause an action, submit, and primitives locally invoked to deliver information
    on state.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This is not a design for an API. It cannot
    be as a basis for any conformance tests. An actual API may make some, all or none
    of the parameters noted here visible to the user and may add additional primitives
    of local significance. The purpose of this service definition is to specify information
    that must or may be available by whatever means, explicit or implicit, to drive
    the operation of the DIF.</p>
