abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-23:2008 specifies Symbolic Music Representation (SMR). A
    symbolic representation of music is a logical structure based on:<br /><br />\r\nsymbolic
    elements representing audiovisual events,<br />\r\nthe relationship between those
    events, and<br />\r\naspects related to how those events can be rendered (visually
    as music notation or audibly) and synchronized with other media types.<br /><br
    /><br />\r\nThe Symbolic Music Representation enables the development of new applications
    in several domains of entertainment, edutainment, infotainment, etc., from education
    and distance learning, to rehearsal and musical practice at home, from consumer
    electronics like set-top boxes for interactive TV to personal computers and mobiles
    systems. The SMR may be used to represent many kinds of symbolic music including
    different styles of Chant, Renaissance, Classic, Romantic and 20th Century styles,
    Korean notation, simplified notations for children, Braille, etc..<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    14496-23:2008 specifies<br /><br />\r\nSymbolic Music Extensible Format (SM-XF)
    an XML based language used to encode musical scores as main scores, single parts
    and the associated lyrics;<br />\r\nSymbolic Music Formatting Language (SM-FL)
    an XML based language used to define the rendering rules that are applied to the
    SM-XF format for rendering it;<br />\r\nSymbolic Music Synchronization Information
    (SM-SI) a binary format describing the synchronisation information between the
    SMR elements and the other audiovisual elements;<br />\r\nsyntax and semantics
    of the SMR bitstream."
