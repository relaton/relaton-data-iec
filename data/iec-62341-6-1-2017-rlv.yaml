  content: "IEC 62341-6-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62341-6-1:2017(E)
    specifies the standard measurement conditions and measuring methods for determining
    optical and electro-optical parameters of organic light-emitting diode (OLED)
    display modules and, where specified, OLED display panels. These methods are limited
    to flat displays measured in a dark room.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)  extends the applicability of the
    measuring methods to include OLED displays that have multi-primary or red, green,
    blue and white sub-pixels;<br />\r\nb)  adds a method to characterize how the
    luminance is affected by the amount of content on the screen;<br />\r\nc)  adds
    a method to determine the dark room colour gamut volume in the CIELAB colour space."
