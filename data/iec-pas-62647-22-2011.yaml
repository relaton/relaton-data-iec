  content: IEC/PAS 62647-22:2011(E) is intended for use as technical guidance by Aerospace
    system Suppliers, e.g., Aerospace system Original Equipment Manufacturers and
    Aerospace system maintenance facilities, in developing and implementing designs
    and processes to ensure the continued performance, quality, reliability, safety,
    airworthiness, configuration control, affordability, maintainability, and supportability
    of high performance aerospace systems (subsequently referred to as AHP) both during
    and after the transition to Pb-Free electronics.
