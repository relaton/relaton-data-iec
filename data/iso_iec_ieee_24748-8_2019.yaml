- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-8:2019 This document establishes the requirements for
    technical reviews and audits to be performed throughout the acquisition life cycle
    for the US Department of Defense (DoD) and other defense agencies. This document
    provides the definition, description, and intent, as well as the entry, exit and
    success criteria, for each technical review and audit. It is to be used to establish
    agreement between acquirers and suppliers on the technical reviews and audits
    that are needed for the project, as well as the focus and expectations of each
    technical review and audit.
