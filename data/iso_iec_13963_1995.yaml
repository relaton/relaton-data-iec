- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nSpecifies
    the characteristics of 90 mm Optical Disk Cartridges (ODC) with a capacity of
    230 Mbytes per cartridge. Specifies three related, but different implementations
    of such cartridges: Type R/W, type P-ROM and type O-ROM. Provides for interchange
    between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems."
