    specifies general requirements of glass-fibre wound, resin or varnish impregnated,
    bare or enamelled rectangular copper wire.The range of nominal conductor dimensions
    is given in 4.1 and the relevant specification sheet. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of dimensional requirements
    for grade 1 enamelled wire in Table 4;<br />\r\n- addition of dielectric breakdown
    requirements for grade 1 enamelled wire in Table 7.<br />\r\n- addition of requirement
    for the adherence test in 8.2.1 and 8.2.2."
