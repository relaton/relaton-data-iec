abstract:
- content: IEC 62951-9:2022(E) specifies the test methods for evaluating the performance
    of unipolar-type one transistor one resistor (1T1R) resistive memory cells. The
    performance test methods in this document include read, forming, SET, RESET, endurance
    and retention. This document is applicable to flexible devices as well as rigid
    resistive memory devices without any limitations prone to device technology and
    size.
