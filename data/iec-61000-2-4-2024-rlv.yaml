  content: "IEC 61000-2-4:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61000-2-4:2024
    is related to conducted disturbances in the frequency range from 0 kHz to 150
    kHz. It gives compatibility levels in differential mode (L-L and L-N) for industrial
    locations, with a nominal voltage up to 35 kV and a nominal frequency of 50 Hz
    or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Industrial locations are defined in 3.1.8.<br />\r\nPower
    distribution systems on ships, aircraft, offshore platforms and railways are not
    included.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 See also Annex E. The compatibility levels specified
    in this document apply at the in-plant point of coupling (IPC). The level of the
    low-frequency disturbances at the terminals of equipment receiving its supply
    from the IPC is generally assumed to be similar to the disturbance level at the
    IPC itself. However, in some situations this is not the case, particularly when
    a long feeder is dedicated to the supply of a particular load, or when a disturbance
    is generated or amplified within the installation of which the equipment forms
    a part.<br />\r\nCompatibility levels are specified for the types of low-frequency
    electromagnetic disturbances expected at any in-plant point of coupling (IPC)
    within industrial locations, for guidance in the definition of:<br />\r\na) limits
    for disturbance emissions in industrial power distribution systems (including
    the planning levels defined in 3.1.5);<br />\r\nNOTE 3 A very wide range of conditions
    is possible in the electromagnetic environments of industrial networks. These
    are approximated in this document by the three classes described in Clause 4.
    However, it is the responsibility of the operator of such a network to take account
    of the particular electromagnetic and economic conditions, including equipment
    characteristics, in setting the above-mentioned limits.<br />\r\nb) immunity levels
    for the equipment within these systems.<br />\r\nThe disturbance phenomena considered
    are:<br />\r\n- voltage deviations;<br />\r\n- voltage dips and short interruptions;<br
    />\r\n- voltage imbalance;<br />\r\n- power-frequency variations;<br />\r\n- harmonics
    up to order 40;<br />\r\n- interharmonics up to the 40th harmonic;<br />\r\n-
    voltage components above the 40th harmonic up to 150 kHz;<br />\r\n- DC component;<br
    />\r\n- transient overvoltages.<br />\r\nThe compatibility levels are given for
    different classes of environment determined by the characteristics of the supply
    network and loads.<br />\r\nNOTE 4 Compatibility levels at the point of common
    coupling (PCC) on public networks are specified in IEC 61000‑2‑2 for low-voltage
    networks and IEC 61000‑2‑12 for medium-voltage networks. IEC TR 61000‑3‑6 and
    IEC TR 61000‑3‑7 describe the approach of power distribution system operators
    to the limitation of emissions from installations and large loads.<br />\r\nThis
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2002. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    introduction of new classes 2a, 2b and 2L (former class 2);<br />\r\nb) modification
    of existing compatibility levels for class 3;<br />\r\nc) addition of compatibility
    levels in the frequency range 2 kHz to 150 kHz;<br />\r\nd) addition of compatibility
    levels using a new quantity: partial weighted harmonic distortion (PWHD)."
