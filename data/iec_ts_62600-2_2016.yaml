abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62600-2:2016(E) provides the essential design requirements to ensure
    the engineering integrity of wave, tidal and other water current energy converters,
    referred to as marine energy converters (MECs), for a specified design life. Provides
    an appropriate level of protection against damage from all hazards that may lead
    to failure of the primary structure, defined as the collective system comprising
    the structural elements, foundation, mooring and anchors, piles, and device buoyancy
    designed to resist global loads. Includes requirements for subsystems of MECs
    such as control and protection mechanisms, internal electrical systems, mechanical
    systems and mooring systems as they pertain to the structural viability of the
    device under site-specific external environmental conditions. This document applies
    to wave, tidal and other water current converters and to structures that are either
    floating or fixed to the seafloor or shore. This document applies to structures
    that are unmanned during operational periods. This document addresses site-specific
    conditions, safety factors for critical structures and structural interfaces,
    external load cases, failure probability and failure consequences for critical
    structures and structural interfaces, and failsafe design practices.
