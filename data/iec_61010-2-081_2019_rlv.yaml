    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 61010-2-081:2019
    applies to automatic and semi-automatic laboratory equipment for analysis and
    other purposes. Automatic and semi-automatic laboratory equipment consists of
    instruments or systems for measuring or modifying one or more characteristics
    or parameters of samples, performing the complete process or parts of the process
    without manual intervention. Equipment forming part of such a system is within
    the scope of this document. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- adaptation of changes introduced by Amendment 1 of
    IEC 61010-1:2010;<br />\r\n- added tolerance for stability of AC voltage test
    equipment to Clause 6.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 104.</p>"
