  content: "IEC 60335-2-40:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-40:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-40:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric heat pumps, sanitary hot water heat pumps and air conditioners, incorporating
    motor-compressors as well as hydronic fan coils units, dehumidifiers (with or
    without motor-compressors), thermoelectric heat pumps and partial units, their
    maximum rated voltage being not more than 300 V for single phase appliances and
    600 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and
    battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household
    use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are
    within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nThe appliances referenced above can
    consist of one or more factory-made assemblies. If provided in more than one assembly,
    the separate assemblies are used together, and the requirements are based on the
    use of matched assemblies.<br />\r\nA definition of ‘motor-compressor’ is given
    in IEC 60335-2-34, which includes the statement that the term motor-compressor
    is used to designate either a hermetic motor-compressor or semi-hermetic motor-compressor.<br
    />\r\nRequirements for containers intended for storage of the heated water included
    in sanitary hot water heat pumps are, in addition, covered by IEC 60335-2-21.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not take into account refrigerants other than group A1,
    A2L, A2 and A3 as defined by ISO 817. Flammable refrigerants are limited to those
    of a molar mass of more than or equal to 42 kg/kmol based on WCF (worst case formulation)
    as specified in ISO 817.<br />\r\nAs far as practical, this standard deals with
    common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered in normal use and
    assumes that installation, servicing, decommissioning, and disposal are safely
    handled by competent persons and accidental release of refrigerants is avoided.
    However, it does not specify the criteria to ensure competence of persons during
    installation, servicing and disposal. Safety requirements during disposal are
    not specified in this standard.<br />\r\nAnnex HH provides informative requirements
    on competence of personnel. Criteria for competence of personnel for the purpose
    of certification schemes can be found in ISO 22712.<br />\r\nUnless specifications
    are covered by this standard, including the annexes, requirements for refrigerating
    safety are covered by:<br />\r\n– ISO 5149-1:2014, ISO 5149-1:2014/AMD1:2015,
    and ISO 5149-1:2014/AMD2:2021,<br />\r\n– ISO 5149-2:2014 and ISO 5149-2:2014/AMD1:2020,<br
    />\r\n– ISO 5149-3:2014 and ISO 5149-3:2014/AMD1:2021.<br />\r\nSupplementary
    heaters, or a provision for their separate installation, are within the scope
    of this standard, but only heaters which are designed as a part of the appliance
    package, the controls being incorporated in the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on-board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n–
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified, for example, by the
    national health authorities responsible for the protection of labour and the national
    authorities responsible for storage, transportation, building constructions and
    installations.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– humidifiers
    intended for use with heating and cooling equipment (IEC 60335-2-88);<br />\r\n–
    appliances designed exclusively for industrial processing;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis
    eighth edition cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in 2022. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Clause 12 : Part 1, Clause 12 has been made applicable;<br />\r\nb) Clause 19:
    requirement added for double wall heat exchangers to be resistant against freezing;<br
    />\r\nc) Clause 20: requirement modified for when to apply test probe 18;<br />\r\nd)
    Clause 21: requirement added for double wall heat exchangers to resistant against
    the pressure of the refrigerant if one of the walls fails;<br />\r\ne) Clause
    22: requirement modified to reflect that appliances can operate continuously and
    can be operated remotely without giving rise to a hazard, and requirement added
    for double wall heat exchangers to be constructed to avoid refrigerant leaking
    into the secondary circuit;<br />\r\nf) Annex LL has been deleted and replaced
    by a reference to IEC TS 63542:2024.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
