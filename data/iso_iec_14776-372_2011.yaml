abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776:2011(E) documents the commands and parameters necessary
    to manage and sense the state of the power supplies, cooling devices, displays,
    indicators, individual drives, and other non-SCSI elements installed in an enclosure.
    The command set uses the SCSI SEND DIAGNOSTIC and RECEIVE DIAGNOSTIC RESULTS command
    to obtain configuration information for the enclosure and to set and sense standard
    bits for each type of element that may be installed in the enclosure.
