- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 specifies</p><ul><li>rules for secure coding
    in the C programming language, and</li><li>code examples.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 17961:2013 does not specify</p><ul><li>the mechanism by which these rules are
    enforced, or</li><li>any particular coding style to be enforced.</li></ul><p>Each
    rule in this Technical Specification is accompanied by code examples. Two distinct
    kinds of examples are provided:</p><ul><li><em>noncompliant examples</em> demonstrating
    language constructs that have weaknesses with potentially exploitable security
    implications; such examples are expected to elicit a diagnostic from a conforming
    analyzer for the affected language construct; and</li><li><em>compliant examples</em>
    are expected not to elicit a diagnostic.</li></ul>"
