abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14543-3-10:2020(E) specifies a wireless protocol for low-powered
    devices such as energy harvesting devices in a home environment. This wireless
    protocol is specifically designed to keep the energy consumption of such sensors
    and switches extremely low.<br />\r\nThe design is characterized by<br />\r\n•
    keeping the communications very short, infrequent and mostly unidirectional, and<br
    />\r\n• using communication frequencies that provide a good range even at low
    transmit power and avoid collisions from disturbers.<br />\r\nThis allows the
    use of small and low-cost energy harvesting devices that can compete with similar
    battery-powered devices. The messages sent by energy harvesting devices are received
    and processed mainly by line-powered devices such as relay switch actuators, repeaters
    or gateways. Together these form part of a home automation system, which, when
    conforming to ISO/IEC 14543 (all parts), is defined as a home electronic system.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies OSI Layers 1 to 3 of the amplitude modulated wireless
    short-packet (AMWSP) protocols.<br />\r\nThe AMWSP protocol system consists of
    two and optionally three types of components that are specified in this document.
    These are the transmitter, the receiver and optionally the repeater. Repeaters
    are needed when the transmitter and the receiver are located in such a way that
    no good direct communication between them can be established.<br />\r\nProtection
    against malicious attacks is handled in the upper layers and thus not treated
    in this document."
