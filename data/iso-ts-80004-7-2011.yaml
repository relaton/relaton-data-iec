  content: ISO/TS 80004-7:2011 is applicable to the use of nanotechnologies in medical
    diagnostics and therapeutics. Terms relating to the applications of nanotechnology
    in healthcare might also be addressed in other parts of ISO/TS 80004 and in other
    documents. Terms relating to the exploitation of material features at the nanoscale
    for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in relation to human disease come within
    the scope of ISO/TS 80004-7:2011. Nanoscale properties can be embodied in materials
    that contain nanoscale elements, or are themselves of nanoscale dimensions. ISO/TS
    80004-7:2011 provides consistent and unambiguous use of terms for healthcare professionals,
    manufacturers, consumers, technologists, patent agents, regulators, NGOs, and
    researchers, etc.
