    <p>ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Standard Library (1.2). These extensions are classes and</p>
    <p>functions that are likely to be used widely within a program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries written</p>
    <p>by different organizations.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is non-normative. Some of the library components in this technical specification may be</p>
    <p>considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but they are not currently part of any C++ standard. Some of</p>
    <p>the components in this technical specification may never be standardized, and others may be standardized in a</p>
    <p>substantially changed form.</p>
    <p>The goal of ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded C++ standard</p>
    <p>library. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>
