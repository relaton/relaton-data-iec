abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29196:2015 consolidates information relating to successful,
    secure and usable implementation of biometric enrolment processes, while indicating
    areas of uncertainty that organisations proposing to use biometric technologies
    will need to address during procurement, design, deployment and operation. Much
    of the information is generic to many types of application e.g. from national
    scale commercial and government applications, through to closed user group systems
    for in-house operations, and to consumer applications where convenience rather
    than security is the primary driver for adoption of biometric technologies.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 29196:2015 points out the differences in operation relating to specific types
    of application, e.g. where self-enrolment is more appropriate than attended operation.
    This report will focus in the main on fixed location enrolments at a number of
    sites in an organization, where there is an attendant who supports the biometric
    applicant in effecting a successful enrolment, and where enrolment is a mandatory
    requirement. In summary, this report consolidates information relating to better
    practice implementation of biometric enrolment capability in various business
    contexts including considerations of legislation, policy, process, function (system)
    and technology.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 29196:2015 provides guidance as to the collection
    and storage of biometric enrolment data and the impact on dependent processes
    of verification and identification. This report will not aim to include material
    specific to forensic and law enforcement applications.</p><p>The recommendations
    contained in the report are not mandatory.</p>"
