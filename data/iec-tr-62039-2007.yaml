  content: Presents the important material properties for polymeric materials used
    in outdoor insulation and, where applicable, lists the standardised test methods
    including the minimum requirements. If no standardised tests are available, then
    test methods reported in literature are summarised. This report is valid for insulating
    materials used in outdoor high voltage electrical applications with a system voltage
    greater than 1000 V a.c. having polymeric insulation including also such applications
    where the housing is an integral part of the devices e.g. in surge arrestors and
    cable terminations. The scope of this report is limited to the materials only.
    The performance of insulators in service depends on several factors such as the
    type of material, the design, environmental conditions etc. Consequently, the
    choice of materials that fulfil the requirements listed below is a necessary condition
    but does not guarantee satisfactory performance when used in outdoor insulation
