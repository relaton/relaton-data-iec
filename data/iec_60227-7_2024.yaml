abstract:
- content: IEC 60227-7:2024 details the particular specifications for polyvinyl chloride
    insulated, screened and unscreened control cables of rated voltages up to and
    including 300/500 V. This document provides the particular requirements for screened
    and unscreened control cables of rated voltages up to and including 300/500 V,
    which apply in addition to the appropriate requirements specified in IEC 60227-1,
    which apply to all cables. The tests for cables specified in the IEC 60227 series
