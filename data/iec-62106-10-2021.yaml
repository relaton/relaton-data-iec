  content: IEC 62106-10:2021(E) describes the Universal Encoder Communication Protocol
    – UECP. The UECP has as its primary objectives to satisfy the need for harmonized
    RDS encoder communication protocols and to facilitate the interworking of various
    RDS systems components, such as RDS servers, data bridges and encoders, regardless
    of the supplier. Furthermore, a harmonised network environment and encoder model
    is being maintained to facilitate the interchange of component parts of RDS network
    systems. These harmonized models and a universal layered protocol are specified,
    based on the ISO/OSI recommendation. The UECP encompasses all current RDS features
    including any new developments using the ODA protocol.
