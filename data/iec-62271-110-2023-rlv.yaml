  content: "IEC 62271-110:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62271-110:2023
    is applicable to AC switching devices designed for indoor or outdoor installation,
    for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on systems having voltages above
    1 000 V and applied for inductive current switching. It is applicable to switching
    devices (including circuit-breakers in accordance with IEC 62271-100) that are
    used to switch high‑voltage motor currents and shunt reactor currents and also
    to high-voltage contactors used to switch high-voltage motor currents as covered
    by IEC 62271-106. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published
    in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    references to IEC 62271-100 and IEC 62271-106 have been updated to the latest
    editions."
