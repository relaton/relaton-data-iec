  content: IEC SRD 63317:2025 which is a systems reference deliverable describes certain
    aspects of standardization of LVDC in industrial applications. These industrial
    applications apply to the secondary economic sector where the processing of resources
    obtains to the production, distribution and storage of physical goods, especially
    in a factory or special area. This document covers the generation, distribution
    and consumption of LVDC power at these premises. This document follows the IEC
    Systems Approach from the domain to the gap analysis and give guidance by describing
    reference implementation.
