  content: "IEC TR 63319:2025 uses a meta-modelling approach to identify commonalities
    among ten smart manufacturing reference models. Each reference model is placed
    into the context of the meta-model to facilitate analysis of both common and distinct
    features. Major smart manufacturing reference model topics are identified, and
    the reference models compared within each topic.<br />\r\nAs part of the meta-modelling
    approach development, a collection of models differing in extent of abstraction
    characterizes the evolution of a particular smart manufacturing system from the
    meta-model through a unifying smart manufacturing reference model and successively
    less abstract domain models to a model for system implementation.<br />\r\nThis
    document presents a range of issues and challenges for further work to specify
    a high-level smart manufacturing reference model that unifies the concepts and
    practices identified using the meta-model approach analysis of the smart manufacturing
    reference models.<br />\r\nIt is published as a dual logo standard."
