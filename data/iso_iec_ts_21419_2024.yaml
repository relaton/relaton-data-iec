abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document describes potential applications of
    biometrics in identity management systems used for medical and healthcare purposes.
    It provides feedback from healthcare practitioners on the advantages, disadvantages,
    risks and priority of implementing certain use cases of healthcare with biometrics.
    For those use cases, information related to the selection of biometric type and
    associated measures related to security and privacy protection is provided to
    system designers.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The document concentrates on aspects
    of the subject which apply to the good management of healthcare services for patients
    who need monitoring, treatment and care in hospitals, clinics or at home, but
    can be incapacitated. It does not cover the measurement and interpretation of
    symptoms and biological data for the purposes of medical treatment or research.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">The document is intended to be useful for the management of
    public and private healthcare systems anywhere in the world, and to commercial
    providers of identity management services and equipment. It is also potentially
    relevant to regulatory stakeholders addressing issues of privacy and legality,
    and the assessment of potential vulnerabilities in biometrics and identity management
    systems applied in the healthcare sector.</p>
