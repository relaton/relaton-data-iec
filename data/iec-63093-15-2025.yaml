  script: Latn
  content: "IEC 63093-15:2025 specifies the dimensions that are of importance for
    mechanical interchangeability for a preferred range of U-cores made of ferrite,
    the essential dimensions of coil formers to be used with them, as well as the
    effective parameter values to be used in calculations involving them and gives
    guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable to U-cores.<br
    />\r\nThe selection of core sizes for this document is based on the philosophy
    of including those sizes which are industrial standards, either by inclusion in
    national standards, or by broad-based use in industry.<br />\r\nThis document
    is a specification useful in the negotiations between ferrite core manufacturers
    and customers about surface irregularities.<br />\r\nThe use of “derived” standards
    which give more detailed specifications of component parts while still permitting
    conformance with this document is discussed in Annex A."
