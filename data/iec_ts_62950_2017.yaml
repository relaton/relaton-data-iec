abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62950:2017(E) sets out a reference framework for defining and testing
    smart capabilities and smart operating modes of appliances, small scale energy
    supplies (SSESs) and other devices (ODs) (collectively termed 'smart devices'
    if they have the defined capabilities). This document does not set minimum requirements
    for appliances, SSESs or ODs.<br />\r\nThis document focuses on electricity consumption
    but the principles and general architecture can be applied to other types of energy
    and other services. This document focuses on appliances, SSESs and ODs, but the
    principles and general architecture can also be applied to other products that
    are capable of being equipped with a device (energy) manager (DEM).<br />\r\nThis
    document:<br />\r\n1) defines terms that describe the smart capabilities and smart
    operating modes of appliances, SSESs and ODs;<br />\r\n2) describes the way in
    which such products respond to certain standard instructions and conditions that
    are likely to arise in the operation of smart grids;<br />\r\n3) describes various
    approaches to measuring how the products respond in particular smart operating
    modes."
