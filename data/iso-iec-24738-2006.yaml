    <p>ISO/IEC 24738:2006 defines a consistent set of icon symbols and related attributes that are presented on a computer screen and with which users interact to decide whether or not to take the associated link. These symbols represent attributes of the link and/or the destination of the link. </p>
    <p>Link attribute icon symbols enable users to decide on the suitability of following associated hyperlinks. Information provided by these icon symbols may also be made available via text. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24738:2006 provides guidance on the graphics to be used by implementers of ISO 14915-2, <i>Software ergonomics for multimedia user interfaces -- Multimedia navigation and control</i>.</p>
    <p>The icon symbol graphics included in ISO/IEC 24738:2006 have been selected on the basis of their ability to convey the desired information to a wide audience of users.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24738:2006 applies to icons that are shown on a computer screen in conjunction with a link also shown on that screen. It describes user interaction with and the appearance of link attribute icons on the screen. Other forms of icons are covered in ISO/IEC 11581, <i>Information technology -- User system interfaces and symbols -- Icon symbols and functions</i>.</p>
