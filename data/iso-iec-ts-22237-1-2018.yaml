    <p>ISO/IEC TS 22237-1:2018:</p>
    <p>a)    details the issues to be addressed in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling application of an appropriate classification of the data centre;</p>
    <p>b)    defines the common aspects of data centres including terminology, parameters and reference models (functional elements and their accommodation) addressing both the size and complexity of their intended purpose;</p>
    <p>c)    describes general aspects of the facilities and infrastructures required to support effective operation of telecommunications within data centres;</p>
    <p>d)    specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of "availability", "security" and "energy-efficiency" over the planned lifetime of the data centre, for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;</p>
    <p>e)    describes the general design principles for data centres upon which the requirements of the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series are based including symbols, labels, coding in drawings, quality assurance and education.</p>
    <p>The following topics are outside of the scope of the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series:</p>
    <p>1)    the selection of information technology and network telecommunications equipment, software and associated configuration issues;</p>
    <p>2)    safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements (covered by other standards and regulations). However, information given in the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations).</p>
