abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-17:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60384-17:2019 applies to
    fixed capacitors with metallized electrodes and polypropylene dielectric for use
    in electronic equipment. Capacitors that have mixed film and metallized electrodes
    are also within the scope of this standard. These capacitors may have \"self-healing\"
    properties depending on conditions of use. Capacitors covered by this specification
    are mainly intended for use with alternating voltage and/or for pulse applications.
    The maximum reactive power applicable is 10 000 var and the maximum peak voltage
    is 3 000 V. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) all parts of the document have
    been revised based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2016 (seventh edition) and
    harmonization between other similar kinds of documents;<br />\r\nb) tables and
    Clause 4 have been revised so as to prevent duplications and contradictions;<br
    />\r\nc) new damp heat steady-state robustness classes with test conditions have
    been added in text, in Clause 4 and in Annex A.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of December 2020 have been included in this copy.</p>"
