    <p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to</p>
    <p>enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recording</p>
    <p>method and the recorded format called VXA-1, and thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such</p>
    <p>magnetic tape cartridges.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies three types depending on the length of magnetic tape contained in the case, referred to as</p>
    <p>Type A, Type B and Type C.</p>
    <p>Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the</p>
    <p>interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p>
    <p>If compression is used with this format, it shall be according to International Standard ISO/IEC 15200.</p>
