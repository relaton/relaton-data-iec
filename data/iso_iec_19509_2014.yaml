abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19509:2014 supports the Meta Object Facility (MOF) Core defined
    in ISO/IEC 19508. MOF is the foundation technology for describing metamodels.
    It covers a wide range of domains, and is based on a constrained subset of UML.
    XMI is widely used XML interchange format. It defines the following aspects involved
    in describing objects in XML:</p><ul><li>the representation of objects in terms
    of XML elements and attributes;</li><li>the standard mechanisms to link objects
    within the same file or across files;</li><li>the validation of XMI documents
    using XML Schemas;</li><li>object identity, which allows objects to be referenced
    from other objects in terms of IDs and UUIDs.</li></ul><p>XMI describes solutions
    to the above issues by specifying EBNF production rules to create XML documents
    and Schemas that share objects consistently.</p>"
