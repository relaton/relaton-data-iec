abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19509:2014 supports the Meta Object Facility (MOF) Core defined in ISO/IEC 19508.
    MOF is the foundation technology for describing metamodels. It covers a wide range
    of domains, and is based on a constrained subset of UML. XMI is widely used XML
    interchange format. It defines the following aspects involved in describing objects
    in XML: - the representation of objects in terms of XML elements and attributes;
    - the standard mechanisms to link objects within the same file or across files;
    - the validation of XMI documents using XML Schemas; - object identity, which
    allows objects to be referenced from other objects in terms of IDs and UUIDs.
    XMI describes solutions to the above issues by specifying EBNF production rules
    to create XML documents and Schemas that share objects consistently."
