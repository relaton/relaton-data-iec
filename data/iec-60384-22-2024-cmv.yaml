  content: "IEC 60384-22:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60384-22:2024 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60384-22:2019
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 40 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60384-22:2024 is applicable to fixed unencapsulated surface
    mount multilayer capacitors of ceramic dielectric, Class 2, for use in electronic
    equipment. These capacitors have metallized connecting pads or soldering strips
    and are intended to be mounted on printed boards, or directly onto substrates
    for hybrid circuits.<br />\r\nCapacitors for electromagnetic interference suppression
    are not included but are covered by IEC 60384-14. The object of this document
    is to specify preferred ratings and characteristics and to select from IEC 60384-1:2021
    the appropriate quality assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and
    to give general performance requirements for this type of capacitor. Test severities
    and requirements specified in detail specifications referring to this sectional
    specification provide specific test severities and requirements of an equal or
    higher performance level. Further information on the conception of generic, sectional
    and detail specifications can be found in the Introduction of IEC 60384-1:2021.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The document has been completely restructured
    to comply with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2 and to make it more useable; tables,
    figures and references have been revised accordingly.<br />\r\nb) The requirements
    of reference temperature 25 °C has been added in Table 5, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    12, Table 14 and Table 17.<br />\r\nc) The table of temperature characteristics
    of capacitance for the reference temperature 25 °C have been added in Table C.1,
    Table C.2 and Table C.3.<br />\r\nd) The requirement in 5.5.2 (visual examination)
    has been repeated in 5.9.3, 5.10.6, 5.11.4, 5.12.6, 5.13.8, 5.14.6 and 5.15.6.<br
    />\r\ne) The deflection D in the very robust designs has been added in 5.9.1.<br
    />\r\nf) Annex C has been changed informative into normative.<br />\r\ng) Clause
    D.5 (Test schedule for quality conformance inspection) has been newly added to
    withdraw the blank detail specification: IEC 60384-22-1."
