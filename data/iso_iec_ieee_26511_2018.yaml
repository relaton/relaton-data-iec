abstract:
- content: "This document supports the needs of users for consistent, complete, accurate,
    and usable information. It provides requirements for strategy, planning, managing,
    staffing, translation, production, and quality and process-maturity assessment
    for managers of information for users. It specifies processes and procedures for
    managing information for users throughout the product- or systems-development
    life cycle. It also includes requirements for key documents produced for managing
    information for users, including strategic and project plans.<br />\r\nThis document
    provides an overview of the information-management processes that are specific
    for the management of information for users. It addresses the following activities:<br
    />\r\n— developing a comprehensive strategy for information development;<br />\r\n—
    assessing user information needs;<br />\r\n— planning and managing an information-development
    project;<br />\r\n— staffing and forming information-development teams;<br />\r\n—
    reviewing and testing information for users;<br />\r\n— managing the translation
    process;<br />\r\n— publishing and delivering information for users;<br />\r\n—
    evaluating customer satisfaction and information quality;<br />\r\n— measuring
    productivity, efficiency, and costs; and<br />\r\n— evaluating organizational
    maturity.<br />\r\nThe guidance in this document applies to multiple project management
    approaches, including both agile and traditional practices. Traditional practices
    can encompass predictive, waterfall, or other top-down management methods. Where
    certain practices are common in agile project management, they are noted.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable for use by managers of information for users or organizations
    with information developers. This document can also be consulted by those with
    other roles and interests in the process of developing information for users:<br
    />\r\n— managers of the product and system development process;<br />\r\n— acquirers
    of information for users prepared by suppliers;<br />\r\n— experienced information
    developers who prepare information for users;<br />\r\n— human-factors experts
    who identify principles for making information for users more accessible and easily
    used; and<br />\r\n— user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together
    to design the presentation of information.<br />\r\nThis document can be applied
    to manage the following types of information for users, although it does not cover
    all aspects of them:<br />\r\n— information for user assistance, training, marketing,
    and systems documentation for product design and development, based on reuse of
    user information topics;<br />\r\n— multimedia marketing presentations using animation,
    video, and sound;<br />\r\n— information developed for virtual and augmented reality
    presentations;<br />\r\n— computer-based training (CBT) packages and course materials
    intended primarily for use in formal training programs; and<br />\r\n— information
    describing the internal operation of products."
