- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document supports the needs
    of users for consistent, complete, accurate, and usable information. It provides
    requirements for strategy, planning, managing, staffing, translation, production,
    and quality and process-maturity assessment for managers of information for users.
    It specifies processes and procedures for managing information for users throughout
    the product- or systems-development life cycle. It also includes requirements
    for key documents produced for managing information for users, including strategic
    and project plans.</p><p>This document provides an overview of the information-management
    processes that are specific for the management of information for users. It addresses
    the following activities:</p><p>— developing a comprehensive strategy for information
    development;</p><p>— assessing user information needs;</p><p>— planning and managing
    an information-development project;</p><p>— staffing and forming information-development
    teams;</p><p>— reviewing and testing information for users;</p><p>— managing the
    translation process;</p><p>— publishing and delivering information for users;</p><p>—
    evaluating customer satisfaction and information quality;</p><p>— measuring productivity,
    efficiency, and costs; and</p><p>— evaluating organizational maturity.</p><p>The
    guidance in this document applies to multiple project management approaches, including
    both agile and traditional practices. Traditional practices can encompass predictive,
    waterfall, or other top-down management methods. Where certain practices are common
    in agile project management, they are noted.</p><p>This document is applicable
    for use by managers of information for users or organizations with information
    developers. This document can also be consulted by those with other roles and
    interests in the process of developing information for users:</p><p>— managers
    of the product and system development process;</p><p>— acquirers of information
    for users prepared by suppliers;</p><p>— experienced information developers who
    prepare information for users;</p><p>— human-factors experts who identify principles
    for making information for users more accessible and easily used; and</p><p>—
    user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together to design the
    presentation of information.</p><p>This document can be applied to manage the
    following types of information for users, although it does not cover all aspects
    of them:</p><p>— information for user assistance, training, marketing, and systems
    documentation for product design and development, based on reuse of user information
    topics;</p><p>— multimedia marketing presentations using animation, video, and
    sound;</p><p>— information developed for virtual and augmented reality presentations;</p><p>—
    computer-based training (CBT) packages and course materials intended primarily
    for use in formal training programs; and</p><p>— information describing the internal
    operation of products.</p>
