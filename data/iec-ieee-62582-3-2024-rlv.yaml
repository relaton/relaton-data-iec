  content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-3:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC/IEEE 62582-3:2024
    contains methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in
    instrumentation and control systems using tensile elongation techniques in the
    detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. This document
    includes the requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement system
    and conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results. The different parts
    of IEC/IEEE 62582 are measurement standards, primarily for use in the management
    of ageing in initial qualification and after installation. IEC/IEEE 62582-1 includes
    requirements for the application of the other parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some
    elements which are common to all methods. This document applies to non-energised
    equipment. This document is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo standard. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Updated best practices relating to condition monitoring using
    the tensile elongation method.<br />\r\nb) Updated bibliography, references and
    context.</p>"
