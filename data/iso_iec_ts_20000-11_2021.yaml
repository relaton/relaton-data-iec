abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 20000-1
    and a commonly used service management framework, ITIL 4. It can be used by any
    organization or person wishing to understand how ITIL can be used with ISO/IEC
    20000-1, including:<br />\r\na) an organization that has claimed or demonstrated
    or intends to claim or demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in
    ISO/IEC 20000-1 and is seeking guidance on the use of ITIL to establish and improve
    an SMS and the services;<br />\r\nb) an organization that already uses ITIL and
    is seeking guidance on how ITIL can be used to support efforts to demonstrate
    conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1;<br />\r\nc) an assessor
    or auditor who wishes to understand the use of ITIL as a support in achieving
    the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1.<br />\r\nClause 4 describes how
    ITIL can support the demonstration of conformity to ISO/IEC 20000–1. Clause 5
    correlates the ITIL documents to requirements in ISO/IEC 20000–1. The tables in
    Annex A correlate terms and clauses in ISO/IEC 20000–1 to ITIL and vice versa;
    the tables in Annex B correlate clauses in ISO/IEC 20000-1 to the ITIL 4 publications
    and vice versa."
