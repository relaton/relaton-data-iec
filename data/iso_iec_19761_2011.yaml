- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 19761:2011 specifies the
    set of definitions, conventions and activities of the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement
    Method. It is applicable to software from the following functional domains:</p><ol><li>application
    software;</li><li>real-time software;</li><li>hybrids of the above.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC
    19761:2011 has not been designed for measuring the functional size of a piece
    of software, or its parts, which</p><ul><li>is characterized by complex mathematical
    algorithms or other specialized and complex rules, such as can be found in expert
    systems, simulation software, self-learning software and weather forecasting systems,
    or</li><li>processes continuous variables such as audio sounds or video images,
    such as can be found in computer game software, musical instruments and the like.</li></ul>
