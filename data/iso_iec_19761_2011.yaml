abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19761:2011 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities
    of the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable to software
    from the following functional domains:    application software;   real-time software;   hybrids
    of the above.     ISO/IEC 19761:2011 has not been designed for measuring the functional
    size of a piece of software, or its parts, which    is characterized by complex
    mathematical algorithms or other specialized and complex rules, such as can be
    found in expert systems, simulation software, self-learning software and weather
    forecasting systems, or   processes continuous variables such as audio sounds
    or video images, such as can be found in computer game software, musical instruments
    and the like.'
