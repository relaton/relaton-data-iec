abstract:
- content: "This document specifies examples of application-specific requirements,
    recommendations and best practices in data acquisition applicable to gait image
    sequence data. Its typical applications include:<br />\r\na) support for human
    examination of high-resolution video and still images;<br />\r\nb) support for
    human biometric verification and identification based on video and still images;<br
    />\r\nc) automated gait image sequence verification and identification.<br />\r\nThis
    document ensures that image sequences are suitable for human identification and
    human verification generated by video surveillance and other similar systems.<br
    />\r\nThe following topics are not in scope of this document:<br />\r\n- Definitions
    for facial and/or full body image related biometric profiles, which are fully
    covered in ISO/IEC 39794-5 and ISO/IEC 39794-16 respectively.<br />\r\n- Security
    aspects like digital image sequence electronic signature, Presentation Attack
    Detection (PAD) and morphing prevention."
