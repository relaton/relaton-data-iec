abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies examples of application-specific requirements,
    recommendations and best practices in data acquisition applicable to gait image
    sequence data. Its typical applications include:</p><p>a) support for human examination
    of high-resolution video and still images;</p><p>b) support for human biometric
    verification and identification based on video and still images;</p><p>c) automated
    gait image sequence verification and identification.</p><p>This document ensures
    that image sequences are suitable for human identification and human verification
    generated by video surveillance and other similar systems.</p><p>The following
    topics are not in scope of this document:</p><p>— Definitions for facial and/or
    full body image related biometric profiles, which are fully covered in ISO/IEC
    39794-5 and ISO/IEC 39794-16 respectively.</p><p>— Security aspects like digital
    image sequence electronic signature, Presentation Attack Detection (PAD) and morphing
    prevention.</p>"
