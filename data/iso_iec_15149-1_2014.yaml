    ISO/IEC 15149-1:2014 specifies the physical layer and media access control layer protocols of wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency band (~300 kHz) for wireless communication in harsh environment (around metal, underwater, underground, etc.).<br />
    The physical layer protocol is designed for the following scope:<br />
    - low carrier frequency for large magnetic field area and reliable communication in harsh environment;<br />
    - simple and robust modulation for a low implementation cost and error performance;<br />
    - variable coding and bandwidth for a link adaptation.<br />
    The media access control layer protocol is designed for the following scope:<br />
    - simple and efficient network topology for low power consumption;<br />
    - variable superframe structure for compact and efficient data transmission;<br />
    - dynamic address assignment for small packet size and efficient address management.<br />
    ISO/IEC 15149-1:2014 supports several kbps data transmission in wireless network within a distance of several metres. It can be applied to various services such as the following areas:<br />
    - environmental industry to manage pollution levels in soil and water using wireless underground or underwater sensors;<br />
    - construction industry to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using wireless, inner-corrosion sensors;<br />
    - consumer-electronics industry to detect food spoilage in wet, airtight storage areas and transfer the sensing data from the inside to the outside;<br />
    - agricultural industry to manage the moisture level as well as mineral status in soil using wireless, buried sensors;<br />
    - transportation industry to manage road conditions and traffic information using wireless, underground sensors.
