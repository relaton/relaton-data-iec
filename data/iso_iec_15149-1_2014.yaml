abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15149-1:2014 specifies the physical layer and media access
    control layer protocols of wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency
    band (~300 kHz) for wireless communication in harsh environment (around metal,
    underwater, underground, etc.).</p><p>The physical layer protocol is designed
    for the following scope:</p><ul><li>low carrier frequency for large magnetic field
    area and reliable communication in harsh environment;</li><li>simple and robust
    modulation for a low implementation cost and error performance;</li><li>variable
    coding and bandwidth for a link adaptation.</li></ul><p>The media access control
    layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p><ul><li>simple and efficient
    network topology for low power consumption;</li><li>variable superframe structure
    for compact and efficient data transmission;</li><li>dynamic address assignment
    for small packet size and efficient address management.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 15149-1:2014
    supports several kbps data transmission in wireless network within a distance
    of several metres. It can be applied to various services such as the following
    areas:</p><ul><li>environmental industry to manage pollution levels in soil and
    water using wireless underground or underwater sensors;</li><li>construction industry
    to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using wireless, inner-corrosion
    sensors;</li><li>consumer-electronics industry to detect food spoilage in wet,
    airtight storage areas and transfer the sensing data from the inside to the outside;</li><li>agricultural
    industry to manage the moisture level as well as mineral status in soil using
    wireless, buried sensors;</li><li>transportation industry to manage road conditions
    and traffic information using wireless, underground sensors.</li></ul>"
