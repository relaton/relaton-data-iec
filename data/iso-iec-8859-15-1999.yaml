    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 191 coded graphic characters identified as Latin alphabet No. 9.<br />This set of coded graphic characters is intended for use in data and text processing applications and also for information interchange.<br />The set contains graphic characters used for general purpose applications in typical office environments in at least the following languages:</p>
    <p>Albanian, Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French, Frisian, Galician, German, Greenlandic, Icelandic,<br />Irish Gaelic (new orthography), Italian, Latin, Luxemburgish, Norwegian, Portuguese, RhaetoRomanic, Scottish Gaelic, Spanish, and Swedish.</p>
    <p>This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded as a version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1.<br />This part of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in conjunction with any other parts of ISO/IEC 8859. If coded characters from more than one part are to<br />be used together, by means of code extension techniques, the equivalent coded character sets from ISO/IEC 10367 should be used instead within<br />a version of ISO/IEC 4873 at level 2 or level 3.<br />The coded characters in this set may be used in conjunction with coded control functions selected from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions are<br />not used to create composite graphic symbols from two or more graphic characters (see clause 6).</p>
    <p><br />NOTE – ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for use with Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information coded according to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such services, it will have to conform to the requirements of those services at the access-point.</p>
