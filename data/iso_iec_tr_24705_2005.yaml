abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 24705:2005 deals with the colour reproduction properties of
    office devices, e. g. printers, scanners and monitors, which may depend on the
    device system, which includes e. g. the device properties and settings, the device
    driver, the file format, the computer operating system and the application software.<br
    /><br />\r\nIt presents a method to allow testing of the reproduction changes
    if one or several of the parameters are varied, such as the device properties
    or settings, the device driver, the file format, the computer operating system,
    the colour space, and the application software. This allows manufacturers and
    users to get a feeling or data about the influence of the different parameters
    on the reproduction."
