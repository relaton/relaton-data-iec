abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-80:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-80:2015(E)
    deals with the safety of electric fans for household and similar purposes, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V
    for other appliances. Examples of fans that are within the scope of this standard
    are ceiling fans; duct fans; partition fans; pedestal fans and table fans. This
    standard also applies to separate controls supplied with fans. Appliances not
    intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger
    to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light
    industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction. It also does not take into account children
    playing with the appliance. It was established on the basis of the fifth edition
    (2010) of that standard. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2002, its Amendment 1 (2007) and its Amendment 2 (2011). It constitutes
    a technical revision. The principal changes in this edition as compared with the
    second edition of IEC 60335-2-80 are as follows (minor changes are not listed):<br
    />\r\n- added definition for ceiling fan suspension system (3.102);<br />\r\n-
    added instructions for ceiling fan maintenance (7.12);<br />\r\n- added instructions
    for ceiling fan installation (7.12.1);<br />\r\n- added entrapment assessment
    criteria for table and pedestal fan with a fan head that oscillates in the up-down
    direction (20.102);<br />\r\n- added requirements for insulation of pre-installed
    internal wiring used to supply attached luminaires (22.101);<br />\r\n- added
    suspension system failure protection requirements for ceiling fans (22.102);<br
    />\r\n- added motor brush wear requirements (27.3).<br />\r\nThe attention of
    National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing
    organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new
    requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is
    the recommendation of the committee that the content of this standard be adopted
    for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months
    from the date of its publication.<br />\r\nKey words: Fans, Duct fans, Pedestal
    fans, Ceiling fans, Partition fans, Table fans"
