abstract:
- content: "IEC 60904-3:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60904-3:2019 describes basic
    measurement principles for determining the electrical output of PV devices. The
    principles given in this document are designed to relate the performance rating
    of PV devices to a common reference terrestrial solar spectral irradiance distribution.
    The reference terrestrial solar spectral irradiance distribution is given in this
    document in order to classify solar simulators according to the spectral performance
    requirements contained in IEC 60904-9. The principles contained in this standard
    cover testing in both natural and simulated sunlight. This new edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) all spectral data were recalculated due to some minor calculation and
    rounding errors in the third edition; the global spectral irradiance returned
    to exactly the data of the second edition;<br />\r\nb) the angular distribution
    of the irradiance was clarified.</p>"
