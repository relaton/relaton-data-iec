    <p>ISO/IEC 22091:2002 specifies a lossless compression algorithm to reduce the number of 8-bit bytes required to represent data records and File Marks. The algorithm is known as Streaming Lossless Data Compression algorithm (SLDC). </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 22091:2002 is based on ISO/IEC 15220. It extends that algorithm with the addition of control symbols that allow records of different sizes and compressibility, along with File Marks, to be efficiently encoded into an output stream which requires little or no additional control information for later decoding.</p>
    <p>The numerical identifier according to ISO/IEC 11576 allocated to this algorithm is 6.</p>
