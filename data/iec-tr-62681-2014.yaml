  content: IEC TR 62681:2014 provides general guidance on the electromagnetic environment
    issues of HVDC transmission lines. It concerns the major parameters adopted to
    describe the electromagnetic environment of a High-Voltage Direct Current (HVDC)
    transmission line, including electric fields, ion current, magnetic fields radio
    interference, and audible noise generated as a consequence of such effects. Engineers
    in different countries can refer to this Technical Report to ensure the safe operation
    of HVDC transmission lines, limit the influence on the environment within acceptable
    ranges, and optimize engineering costs.
