  content: 'IEC TR 62343-6-9:2015(E) which is a Technical Report, describes a study
    of the impact of WSS dynamic crosstalk on the optical network and includes dynamic
    crosstalk measurement examples for three types of WSS. The generating mechanism
    and the generation factor of dynamic crosstalk in WSS are clarified, and the evaluation
    of same-channel crosstalk and different-channel crosstalk is shown to be necessary.
    Keywords: WSS, wavelength selective switch'
