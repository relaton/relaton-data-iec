abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29138-3:2022 This document provides guidance on the mapping of
    a set of user accessibility needs with the provisions of a particular standard,
    technical report, or set of guidelines. It provides both basic guidance that should
    be used for all user accessibility needs mapping and optional guidance that may
    be added to the basic guidance.<br />\r\nUser accessibility needs mapping is intended
    to help improve accessibility for all users and, in particular, for users with
    special needs that can be overlooked. User accessibility needs mapping is not
    intended to be used to evaluate or certify a given standard or set of guidelines."
