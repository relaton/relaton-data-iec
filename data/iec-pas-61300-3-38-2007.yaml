  content: The purpose of this PAS is to define the measurement methods necessary
    to characterize the group delay properties of passive components. From these measurements
    further parameters like group delay ripple, linear phase deviation, chromatic
    dispersion, and dispersion slope can be derived. In addition, when these measurements
    are made with resolved polarization, the differential group delay (DGD) can also
    be determined as an alternative to separate measurement with the dedicated methods
    of IEC 61300-3-32.
