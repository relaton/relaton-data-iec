abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    22051:2002 specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of magnetic tape
    cartridges, using magnetic tape 12,65 mm wide so as to provide physical interchange
    of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the recording method and the recorded format, thereby allowing data interchange
    between drives by means of such cartridges.<br />\r\nThe linearly recorded format,
    called Super Digital Linear Tape 1 (SDLT 1), has 448 tracks. It uses a combination
    of magnetic and optical technologies known as Laser-Guided Magnetic Recording
    (LGMR). The back surface of the tape presents optically detected servo marks.<br
    />\r\nThe format is derived from the DLT Format. It provides for a capacity of
    110 Gbytes of uncompressed user data, or typically 220 Gbytes of compressed user
    data.<br />\r\nTogether with a standard for volume and file structure this document
    provides for full data interchange between data processing systems."
