abstract:
- content: This Technical Report specifies a method to enable product committees to
    develop limits for alternative test methods, using conversions from established
    limits. This method is generally applicable for all kinds of disturbance measurements,
    but focuses on radiated disturbance measurements (i.e. field strength), for which
    several alternative methods are presently specified. These limits development
    methods are intended for use by product committees and other groups responsible
    for defining emissions limits in situations where it is decided to use alternative
    test methods and the associated limits in product standards.
