abstract:
- content: "IEC 61978-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61978-1:2024
    applies to fibre optic passive chromatic dispersion compensators, all exhibiting
    the following features:<br />\r\n- they are optically passive;<br />\r\n- they
    have an optical input and an optical output for transmitting optical power;<br
    />\r\n- the ports are optical fibres or optical fibre connectors;<br />\r\n- they
    are wavelength sensitive;<br />\r\n- they can be polarization sensitive.<br />\r\nThis
    document establishes uniform requirements for the passive chromatic dispersion
    compensator. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) harmonization of terms and definitions with IEC TS 62627-09;<br />\r\nb)
    change of Clause 4 regarding requirements."
