  content: "IEC 62153-4-9:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62153-4-9:2018
    applies to metallic communication cables. It specifies a test method for determining
    the coupling attenuation a<sub>C</sub> of screened balanced cables. Due to the
    concentric outer tube, measurements are independent of irregularities on the circumference
    and external electromagnetic fields. A wide dynamic and frequency range can be
    applied to test even super screened cables with normal instrumentation from low
    frequencies up to the limit of defined transversal waves in the outer circuit
    at approximately 4 GHz. However, when using a balun, the upper frequency is limited
    by the properties of the balun. Measurements can be performed with standard tube
    procedure (respectively with standard test head) according to IEC 62153-4-4 or
    with open tube (open test head) procedure.<br />\r\nThe procedure described herein
    to measure the coupling attenuation a<sub>C</sub> is based on the procedure to
    measure the screening attenuation a<sub>S</sub> according to IEC 62153-4-4. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n–
    two test procedures, open head and standard head procedure;<br />\r\n– measuring
    with balun or with multiport respectively mixed mode VNA;<br />\r\n– extension
    of frequency range up to and above 2 GHz."
