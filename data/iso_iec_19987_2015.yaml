abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19987:2015 is a GS1 Standard that defines Version 1.1 of EPC Information
    Services (EPCIS). The goal of EPCIS is to enable disparate applications to create
    and share visibility event data, both within and across enterprises. Ultimately,
    this sharing is aimed at enabling users to gain a shared view of physical or digital
    objects within a relevant business context.<p>"Objects" in the context of EPCIS
    typically refers to physical objects that are identified either at a class or
    instance level and which are handled in physical handling steps of an overall
    business process involving one or more organizations. Examples of such physical
    objects include trade items (products), logistic units, returnable assets, fixed
    assets, physical documents, etc. "Objects" may also refer to digital objects,
    also identified at either a class or instance level, which participate in comparable
    business process steps. Examples of such digital objects include digital trade
    items (music downloads, electronic books, etc.), digital documents (electronic
    coupons, etc), and so forth. Throughout this document the word "object" is used
    to denote a physical or digital object, identified at a class or instance level,
    that is the subject of a business process step. EPCIS data consist of "visibility
    events," each of which is the record of the completion of a specific business
    process step acting upon one or more objects.</p><p>The EPCIS standard was originally
    conceived as part of a broader effort to enhance collaboration between trading
    partners by sharing of detailed information about physical or digital objects.
    The name EPCIS reflects the origins of this effort in the development of the Electronic
    Product Code (EPC). It should be noted, however, that EPCIS does not require the
    use of Electronic Product Codes, nor of Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID)
    data carriers, and as of EPCIS 1.1 does not even require instance-level identification
    (for which the Electronic Product Code was originally designed). The EPCIS standard
    applies to all situations in which visibility event data is to be captured and
    shared, and the presence of "EPC" within the name is of historical significance
    only.</p><p>EPCIS provides open, standardised interfaces that allow for seamless
    integration of well-defined services in inter-company environments as well as
    within companies. Standard interfaces are defined in the EPCIS standard to enable
    visibility event data to be captured and queried using a defined set of service
    operations and associated data standards, all combined with appropriate security
    mechanisms that satisfy the needs of user companies. In many or most cases, this
    will involve the use of one or more persistent databases of visibility event data,
    though elements of the Services approach could be used for direct application-to-application
    sharing without persistent databases.</p><p>With or without persistent databases,
    the EPCIS specification specifies only a standard data sharing interface between
    applications that capture visibility event data and those that need access to
    it.<em>It does not specify how the service operations or databases themselves
    should be implemented.</em> This includes not defining how the EPCIS services
    should acquire and/or compute the data they need, except to the extent the data
    is captured using the standard EPCIS capture operations. The interfaces are needed
    for interoperability, while the implementations allow for competition among those
    providing the technology and implementing the standard.</p><p>EPCIS is intended
    to be used in conjunction with the GS1 Core Business Vocabulary (CBV) standard
    [CBV1.1]. The CBV standard provides definitions of data values that may be used
    to populate the data structures defined in the EPCIS standard. The use of the
    standardized vocabulary provided by the CBV standard is critical to interoperability
    and critical to provide for querying of data by reducing the variation in how
    different businesses express common intent. Therefore, applications should use
    the CBV standard to the greatest extent possible in constructing EPCIS data.</p>
