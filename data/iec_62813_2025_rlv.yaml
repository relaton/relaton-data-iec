abstract:
- content: "IEC 62813:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62813:2025
    specifies the electrical characteristics (capacitance, internal resistance, discharge
    accumulated electric energy, and voltage maintenance rate) test methods of lithium-ion
    capacitors (LIC) for use in electric and electronic equipment.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) The document has been restructured to comply with the ISO/IEC
    Directives, Part 2."
