abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63116:2021+AMD1:2023 specifies general requirements for design,
    installation and maintenance of a lighting system. A lighting system comprises
    a set of products. Requirements of the products are specified in product standards.
    For the general requirements of lighting systems, this document prevails. Construction
    of lighting systems can vary in applications. This document is not intended to
    provide detailed technical specifications for the construction of lighting systems
    but to specify requirements in general that are necessary for lighting systems.
