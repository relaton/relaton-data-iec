abstract:
- content: This model of an energy management system for residences extends the set
    of HES (Home Electronic System) application models. Models for lighting and security
    have already been developed and accepted. These models should facilitate the validation
    of the language specified for HES in ISO/IEC 15067-1. These models have been developed
    to foster interoperability among products from competing or complementary manufacturers.
    Product interoperability is essential when using home control standards, such
    as HES. This document defines a typical security system and describes the communications
    services needed. A high-level model for an energy management system using HES
    is presented. The model for energy management presented in this Technical Report
    is generic and representative of a wide range of situations. It accommodates a
    range of load control strategies.
