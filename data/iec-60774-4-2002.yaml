  content: The S-VHS ET mode records an S-VHS signal format on a VHS cassette. In
    this mode, several video signal system recording parameters are switched so that
    the signal characteristics recorded on the VHS tape are equivalent to S-VHS recording
    on S-VHS tape. Cassettes recorded in the S-VHS ET mode can be played with an S-VHS
    based playback system and an VHS equivalent that includes the SQPB function.
