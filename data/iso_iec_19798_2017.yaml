abstract:
- content: 'The scope of ISO/IEC 19798:2017 is limited to evaluation of toner cartridge
    page yield for toner-containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and
    toner cartridges without a photoconductor) for colour electrophotographic print
    systems. This document can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional
    device that has a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices
    that contain electrophotographic printer components.<p>ISO/IEC 19798:2017 is only
    intended for the measurement of toner cartridge page yield when printing on plain
    paper using cyan, magenta, yellow and black toner cartridges. No other claims
    can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19798:2017 is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal
    to or greater than A3 or for photo-only printers.</p><p>NOTE 1 Application of
    this document for yield measurement of toner replenishment systems (i.e. toner
    cartridge and bottle type systems where the toner reservoir is internal to the
    printing system and not user-replaceable) requires some procedural modifications
    specifically noted herein. This document is intended for equipment used in the
    office space and does not apply to production volume or large format printing
    machines where the major cost of ownership is not caused by the consumable yield
    measured in this document.</p><p>NOTE 2 An all-in-one toner cartridge is a cartridge
    that includes at least: a toner containment part, a photoreceptor part and a developer
    part (see ISO/IEC 29142â€‘1).</p>'
