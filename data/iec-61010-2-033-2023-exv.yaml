  content: "IEC 61010-2-033:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 61010-2-033:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD1:2016.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC
    61010-2-033:2023 specifies safety requirements for hand-held multimeters and other
    meters for domestic and professional use, capable of measuring mains. Hand-held
    multimeters are multi-range multifunction measuring instruments intended to measure
    voltage and other electrical quantities such as resistance or current. Their primary
    purpose is to measure voltage on a live mains. They are suitable to be supported
    by one hand during normal use. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 2, all normative references have been dated
    and new normative references have been added;<br />\r\nb) 4.4.2.101 is a new subclause
    about surge protective devices;<br />\r\nc) Subclause 6.6.101 modifies 6.6.101
    and 6.6.102 of previous edition:<br />\r\n1) in 6.6.101.1, insulating material
    of group I may be allowed for determination of creepage distances of measuring
    circuit terminals;<br />\r\n2) in 6.6.101.2, Clearances and creepage distances
    up to 3 000 V for measuring circuit terminals in unmated position have been defined;<br
    />\r\n3) in 6.6.101.3, requirements for measuring circuit terminals in partially
    mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n4) in 6.6.101.4, requirements for
    measuring circuit terminals in mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n5)
    Subclause 6.6.101.5 replaces 6.6.102;<br />\r\nd) Subclause 6.101 replaces 6.9.101
    of the previous edition with modifications;<br />\r\ne) 9.101 is a new subclause
    to consider the protection of measuring circuits against the spread of fire and
    arc flash;<br />\r\nf) in 9.101.2, relocation of 101.3 of previous edition;<br
    />\r\ng) in 9.101.3, relocation of 101.4 of previous edition;<br />\r\nh) in 101.3,
    relocation of Clause 102 of previous edition;<br />\r\ni) in K.2.1, another method
    for determination of clearances of secondary circuits is proposed;<br />\r\nj)
    in K.3.2, new Table K.15 and Table K.16 for clearance calculation;<br />\r\nk)
    Clause K.4 of the previous edition has been deleted;<br />\r\nl) Subclause K.101.4
    has been reviewed;<br />\r\nm) Table K.104 of the previous edition has been deleted;<br
    />\r\nn) Annex AA: Figure AA.1 has been redesigned;<br />\r\no) Annex EE: addition
    of a new informative annex for determination of clearances for the purposes of
    Table 101."
