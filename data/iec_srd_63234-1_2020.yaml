abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63234-1:2020 provides a descriptive framework and template for
    the economic evaluation of the implementation of technology-supported home healthcare
    or wellness services, or AAL services that support communications, transportation,
    etc. as defined in a series of AAL use cases. The financial analysis is completed
    from the point of view of the healthcare services funder, aged care services funder,
    or similar governmental or non-governmental organization (e.g. the government
    in a state-sponsored system or possibly a health management/health insurance company
    in a privately funded system, a private or governmental organization financing
    delivery of home support or specialized transportation services).<br />\r\nThis
    document is structured to provide a means of capturing data for a Reference Scenario
    (typically the current means of providing care, often known as 'usual care', to
    the target patient population) to compare against an Alternate Scenario (the service
    or technology intervention) for an economic comparison. Standard economic measures
    can be estimated (using an electronic spreadsheet or other analysis tool) such
    as Return on Investment (ROI), Net Present Value (NPV), and Payback Period of
    the investment.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to all potential AAL services
    and AAL systems that may be developed or the development and manufacture of any
    of the underlying components (whether hardware or software)."
