  content: "IEC TS 60695-5-2:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TS
    60695-5-2:2021 gives a summary of the test methods that are used in the assessment
    of the corrosivity of fire effluent. It presents a brief summary of test methods
    in common use, either as international standards or national or industry standards.
    It includes special observations on their relevance, for electrotechnical products
    and their materials, to real fire scenarios and gives recommendations on their
    use.<br />\r\nOne of the responsibilities of a technical committee is, wherever
    applicable, to make use of basic safety publications in the preparation of its
    publications. The requirements, test methods or test conditions of this publication
    will not apply unless specifically referred to or included in the relevant publications.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2002.<br />\r\nThe main changes with respect to the previous edition are listed
    below:<br />\r\n– References to IEC TS 60695-5-3 (withdrawn in 2014) have been
    removed.<br />\r\n– ISO/TR 9122-1 has been revised by ISO 19706.<br />\r\n– References
    to ISO 11907-2 and ISO 11907-3 have been removed.<br />\r\n– Terms and definitions
    have been updated.<br />\r\n– Text in 5.4 has been updated.<br />\r\n– Text in
    5.5.8 (5.7.8 in Ed. 2) has been updated.<br />\r\n– Text in Clause 6 (7 in Ed.
    2) has been updated.<br />\r\n– Bibliographic references have been updated.<br
    />\r\nIt has the status of a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide
    104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nThis technical specification is to be read
    in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/2961\">IEC 60695-5-1</a>."
