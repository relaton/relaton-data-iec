abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies test methods as well as
    test charts to measure the geometric property attributes and those variations
    in duplex colour prints typically used in office environment. This document is
    applicable to duplex prints comprising several sheets which are printed colour
    images on both surfaces of a substrate.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">“Within-page
    variation” and “sheet-to-sheet variation” are also applicable for a simplex print
    set comprising several sheets, which are printed colour images on one surface
    of a substrate and no image on the other surface.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Prints
    with four primary colourants other than cyan, magenta, yellow and black are outside
    the scope of this document.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Included are digital prints
    formed by using a multifunction or single function printer. When a duplex print
    set is evaluated, duplex printers which are capable to print images on both sides
    of substrate automatically are applicable, while simplex printers which require
    a manual arrangement of substrates between the front side and back side printing
    to form duplex prints are out of scope of this document. The printers of the maximum
    applicable substrate size of A4 or larger are suitable for the measurements.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">The geometric property attributes included are registration
    and magnification of a print set.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Microscopic geometrical
    density variations, such as graininess, mottle and line raggedness, are outside
    the scope of this document.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The sources of variations
    considered are locations in a page, print side in a sheet, print order of sheets
    in a print set, and variations among primary colours.</p>
