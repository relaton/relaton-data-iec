  content: IEC 62047-31:2019 (E) specifies a four-point bending test method for measuring
    interfacial adhesion energy of the weakest interface in the layered micro-electromechanical
    systems (MEMS) based on the concept of fracture mechanics. In a variety of MEMS
    devices, there are many layered material interfaces, and their adhesion energies
    are critical to the reliability of the MEMS devices. The four-point bending test
    utilizes a pure bending moment applied to a test piece of layered MEMS device,
    and the interfacial adhesion energy is measured from the critical bending moment
    for the steady state cracking in the weakest interface. This test method applies
    to MEMS devices with thin film layers deposited on semiconductor substrates. The
    total thickness of the thin film layers should be 100 times less than the thickness
    of a supporting substrate (typically a silicon wafer piece).
