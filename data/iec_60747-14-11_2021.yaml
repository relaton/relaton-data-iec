abstract:
- content: 'IEC 60747-14-11:2021(E) defines the terms, definitions, configuration,
    and test methods can be used to evaluate and determine the performance characteristics
    of surface acoustic wave-based semiconductor sensors integrated with ultraviolet,
    illuminance, and temperature sensors. The measurement methods are for DC characteristics
    and RF characteristics, and the measurement method for RF characteristics includes
    a direct mode and differential amplifier mode based on feedback oscillation. This
    document excludes devices dealt with by TC 49: piezoelectric, dielectric and electrostatic
    devices and associated materials for frequency control, selection and detection.'
