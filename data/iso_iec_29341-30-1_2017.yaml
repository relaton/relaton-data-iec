abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-30-1:2017 describes the overall UPnP IoTManagementAndControl Architecture,
    which forms the foundation for the UPnP IoTManagementAndControl device [11] and
    UPnP DataStore service [13] specifications. The IoTManagementAndControl device
    hosts services to bridge sensor devices connected to both UPnP networks as well
    as non-UPnP based networks. The DataStore service provides persistent retention
    and distribution of both sensor data as well as data from mobile devices which
    may leave the UPnP network at any time. This service can be hosted within the
    UPnP IoTManagementAndControl device as well as within other UPnP compliant devices."
