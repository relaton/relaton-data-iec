abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-30-1:2017 describes the overall UPnP IoTManagementAndControl
    Architecture, which forms the foundation for the UPnP IoTManagementAndControl
    device [11] and UPnP DataStore service [13] specifications. The IoTManagementAndControl
    device hosts services to bridge sensor devices connected to both UPnP networks
    as well as non-UPnP based networks. The DataStore service provides persistent
    retention and distribution of both sensor data as well as data from mobile devices
    which may leave the UPnP network at any time. This service can be hosted within
    the UPnP IoTManagementAndControl device as well as within other UPnP compliant
    devices.</p>"
