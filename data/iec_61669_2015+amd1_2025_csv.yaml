abstract:
- content: IEC 61669:2015+AMD1:2025 CSV gives recommendations and requirements for
    the measurement and estimation of the real-ear acoustical performance characteristics
    of air-conduction hearing aids and for the measurement of certain acoustic properties
    of the ear related to the application of hearing aids. Measurements of real-ear
    acoustical characteristics of hearing aids which apply non-linear or analytical
    processing techniques are valid only for the test signals used and conditions
    employed. The purpose of this standard is to ensure that measurements of real-ear
    acoustical performance characteristics of a given hearing aid on a given human
    ear can be replicated in other locations with other test equipment. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61669:2001 and the first
    edition of ISO 12124:2001. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
