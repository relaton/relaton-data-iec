abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies technology that supports
    the efficient transmission and rendering of haptic signals for the playback of
    immersive experiences in a wide variety of scenarios. The document describes in
    detail a robust coded representation of haptic media covering the two most popular
    haptic perceptions leveraged by devices today: vibrotactile and kinaesthetic.
    Support for other haptic modalities has also been integrated.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The
    coded representation allows to encode both descriptive and quantized data in a
    human readable JSON format used for exchange purposes, and a compressed bitstream
    version, optimised for memory usage and distribution purposes. This approach also
    allows to meet the expectations for compatibility with both descriptive and quantized
    formats, as required by the market, as well as interoperability between devices
    for 3D immersive experiences, mobile applications and other distribution purposes.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">Information provided in this document related to the decoder
    is normative, while information related to the encoder and renderer is informative.</p>'
