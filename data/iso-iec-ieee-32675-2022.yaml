    <p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document provides requirements and guidance on the implementation of DevOps to define, control, and improve software life cycle processes. It applies within an organization or a project to build, package, and deploy software and systems in a secure and reliable way. This document specifies practices to collaborate and communicate effectively in groups including development, operations, and other key stakeholders.</p>
    <p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document applies a common framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied to the full life cycle of software systems, products, and services, including conception, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement. It also applies to the acquisition and supply of software systems, whether performed internally or externally to an organization. These life cycle processes are accomplished through the involvement of stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. The life cycle processes of this document can be applied concurrently, iteratively, and recursively to a software system and incrementally to its elements.</p>
    <p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document applies to software systems, products, and services, and the software portion of any system. Software includes the software portion of firmware. Those aspects of system definition needed to provide the context for software systems, products, and services are included.</p>
    <p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">There is a wide variety of software systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application, complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans, and evolution. This document describes the processes that comprise the life cycle of software systems. It therefore applies to one-of-a-kind software systems, software systems for wide commercial or public distribution, and customized, adaptable software systems. It also applies to a complete stand-alone software system and to software systems that are embedded and integrated into larger, more complex, and complete systems.</p>
