    <p>Thin flexible cards (TFC), the subject of ISO/IEC 15457, are used to automate the controls for access to goods or services such as mass transit, highway toll systems, car parks, vouchers, stored value, etc.</p>
    <p>For these applications, data can be written and/or read by machines using various recording techniques such as magnetic stripe, optical character recognition (OCR), bar code, contactless, etc.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15457-1:2008 specifies the physical characteristics of thin flexible cards at two points in the card life cycle:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>at the point of loading into the card issuing equipment;</li>
    <li>at the point of issue to the public.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states the minimum requirements.</p>
    <p>The principal card sizes are identified and the characteristics and dimensions are specified.</p>
    <p>Guidance concerning the storage and use of cards under various environmental conditions is given.</p>
