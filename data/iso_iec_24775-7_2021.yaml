    24775-7:2021 The host-base storage portion of the Storage Management Technical
    Specification defines management profiles for autonomous, component and abstract
    profiles for management of host-based storage devices.Ã‚ The autonomous profiles
    describe the management of a stand-alone host-based storage entity. The component
    profiles describe management of aspects of host-based storage entities that may
    be used by other autonomous profiles. Finally, this section describes abstract
    profiles that may be used as a basis for creating additional Host-based autonomous
    profiles.<br />\r\nThis version of the Host-based Storage portion of the Storage
    Management Technical Specification includes autonomous profiles:<br />\r\n- \"The
    Host Discovered Resources Profile<br />\r\nThis profile defines the model for
    the storage devices presented to an operating system running on a host computer
    system. In addition, this profile describes the map of storage associated to a
    host-computer system that a client application can discover.<br />\r\n- \"The
    Fibre Channel HBA Profile<br />\r\nThis profile defines the model and functions
    of a Fibre Channel HBA that exports block storage to a host computer system from
    a SAN device (Fibre Channel switch, array, tape library, etc.).<br />\r\n- iSCSI
    Initiator Profile<br />\r\nThis profile defines the model and functions necessary
    to manage an iSCSI initiator.<br />\r\nComponent profiles used by autonomous profiles
    to describe aspects of host-based storage elements and services. The component
    profiles defined in this version of the specification include:<br />\r\n- Host
    Hardware RAID Controller Profile<br />\r\nThis profile defines the model and functions
    of a host-based RAID controller that exports block storage to a host computer
    system from locally attached storage devices (internal hard drives, JBODs, etc.)<br
    />\r\n- Storage HBA Profile<br />\r\nThis profile defines the model and functions
    of a SAS, SATA, SPI, or Fibre Channel HBA that exports storage to a host computer
    system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel switch, array, tape library, etc.).<br
    />\r\n- Disk Partition Profile<br />\r\nThe Disk Partition profile models partition
    (or slice) configuration services provided by operating systems on some platforms.<br
    />\r\n- SB Multipath Management Profile<br />\r\nThe SB Multipath Management Profile
    models paths (connections between host controllers and device ports) for environments
    supporting the SB (Single Byte) command protocol.<br />\r\n- SCSI Multipath Management
    Profile<br />\r\nThe SCSI Multipath Management profile models paths (connections
    between host controllers, device ports, and logical units) for environments supporting
    the SCSI command protocol."
