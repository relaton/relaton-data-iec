abstract:
- content: '<p style="text-align: left;">The host-base storage portion of the Storage
    Management Technical Specification defines management profiles for autonomous,
    component and abstract profiles for management of host-based storage devices.
    The autonomous profiles describe the management of a stand-alone host-based storage
    entity. The component profiles describe management of aspects of host-based storage
    entities that may be used by other autonomous profiles. Finally, this section
    describes abstract profiles that may be used as a basis for creating additional
    Host-based autonomous profiles.<br />This version of the Host-based Storage portion
    of the Storage Management Technical Specification includes autonomous profiles:</p><ul><li
    style="text-align: left;">"The Host Discovered Resources Profile<br />This profile
    defines the model for the storage devices presented to an operating system running
    on a host<br />computer system. In addition, this profile describes the map of
    storage associated to a host-computer system<br />that a client application can
    discover.</li><li style="text-align: left;">"The Fibre Channel HBA Profile<br
    />This profile defines the model and functions of a Fibre Channel HBA that exports
    block storage to a host<br />computer system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel
    switch, array, tape library, etc.).</li><li style="text-align: left;">iSCSI Initiator
    Profile<br />This profile defines the model and functions necessary to manage
    an iSCSI initiator.<br />Component profiles used by autonomous profiles to describe
    aspects of host-based storage elements<br />and services. The component profiles
    defined in this version of the specification include:</li><li style="text-align:
    left;">Host Hardware RAID Controller Profile<br />This profile defines the model
    and functions of a host-based RAID controller that exports block storage to a<br
    />host computer system from locally attached storage devices (internal hard drives,
    JBODs, etc.)</li><li style="text-align: left;">Storage HBA Profile<br />This profile
    defines the model and functions of a SAS, SATA, SPI, or Fibre Channel HBA that
    exports storage<br />to a host computer system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel
    switch, array, tape library, etc.).</li><li style="text-align: left;">Disk Partition
    Profile<br />The Disk Partition profile models partition (or slice) configuration
    services provided by operating systems on<br />some platforms.</li><li style="text-align:
    left;">SB Multipath Management Profile<br />The SB Multipath Management Profile
    models paths (connections between host controllers and device ports)<br />for
    environments supporting the SB (Single Byte) command protocol.</li><li style="text-align:
    left;">SCSI Multipath Management Profile<br />The SCSI Multipath Management profile
    models paths (connections between host controllers, device ports,<br />and logical
    units) for environments supporting the SCSI command protocol.</li></ul>'
