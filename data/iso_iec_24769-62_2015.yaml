abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24769-62:2015 defines the test methods for determining the conformance
    of Ultra Wide Band real-time locating system (RTLS) tags with the specifications
    given in the corresponding parts of ISO/IEC 24730â€‘62, but does not apply to the
    testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.<p>The test methods
    require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are
    implemented, be verified. This may in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented
    by further, application specific functionality criteria that are not available
    to the general case.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 24769-62:2015
    apply exclusively to RTLS tags defined in ISO/IEC 24730-62.</p>
