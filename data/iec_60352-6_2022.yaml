abstract:
- content: "IEC 60352-6:2022 This part of IEC 60352 is applicable to insulation piercing
    connections made with stranded wires and tinsel wires, insulated flat conductors
    and flat flexible circuitries for use in electrical and electronic equipment.\r\nInformation
    on materials and data from industrial experience is included in addition to the
    test procedures to provide electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental
    conditions.\r\nThe object of this document is to:\r\ndetermine the suitability
    of insulation piercing connections under specified mechanical, electrical, and
    atmospheric conditions;\r\nprovide a means of comparing test results when the
    tools used to make the connections, if any, are of different designs or manufacture."
