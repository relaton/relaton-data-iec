  content: "IEC/TR 62316:2017 which is a Technical Report, aims to provide guidelines
    for the interpretation of backscattering traces, as obtained by traditional optical
    time domain reflectometers (OTDRs) – not including polarization OTDRs – for single-mode
    fibres. Also, backscattered power effects are discussed in case of unidirectional
    trace. Full description of the test measurement procedure can be found in Annex
    C of IEC 60793-1-40:2001. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2007. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. the scope has been extended to include single-mode fibres;<br />\r\nb.
    backscattered power effects are discussed in case of unidirectional trace, including
    so-called losers and gainers.<br />\r\nc. example of apparent splice loss evaluation
    for unidirectional OTDR measurements has been added:<br />\r\nd. description of
    launch and tail cords have been added;<br />\r\ne. figures have been improved."
