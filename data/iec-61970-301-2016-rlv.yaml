  content: "IEC 61970-301:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61970-301:2016
    lays down the common information model (CIM), which is an abstract model that
    represents all the major objects in an electric utility enterprise typically involved
    in utility operations. By providing a standard way of representing power system
    resources as object classes and attributes, along with their relationships, the
    CIM facilitates the integration of network applications developed independently
    by different vendors, between entire systems running network applications developed
    independently, or between a system running network applications and other systems
    concerned with different aspects of power system operations, such as generation
    or distribution management. SCADA is modeled to the extent necessary to support
    power system simulation and inter-control centre communication. The CIM facilitates
    integration by defining a common language (i.e. semantics) based on the CIM to
    enable these applications or systems to access public data and exchange information
    independent of how such information is represented internally. This new edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new model for grounding including Petersen coils;<br />\r\n-
    models for HVDC; addition of Static Var Compensation models;<br />\r\n- phase
    shift transformer updates;<br />\r\n- short circuit calculations based on IEC
    60909;<br />\r\n- addition of non-linear shunt compensator;<br />\r\n- addition
    of model for steady state calculation inputs, Steady State Hypothesis;<br />\r\n-
    addition of base frequency model;<br />\r\n- Annex A with custom extensions added."
