  content: "IEC/TR 61156-1-2:2009+A1:2014 is a revision of the symmetrical pair/quad
    electrical transmission characteristics present in IEC 61156-1:2002 (Edition 2)
    and not carried into IEC 61156-1:2007 (Edition 3). This technical report includes
    the following topics from IEC 61156-1:2002<br />\r\n- the characteristic impedance
    test methods and function fitting procedures of 3.3.6;<br />\r\n- Annex A covering
    basic transmission line equations and test methods;<br />\r\n- Annex B covering
    the open/short-circuit method;<br />\r\n- Annex C covering unbalance attenuation.
    <strong>This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2009) and its
    amendment 1 (2014). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
    publication.</strong>"
