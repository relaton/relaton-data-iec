  content: IEC PAS 63083:2017(E) applies to measurement procedures of Specific Absorption
    Rate (SAR) generated by devices with LTE (Long Term Evolution) technology specified
    by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), Rel. 8 and 9 [1] where the devices
    are intended to be used with the radiating part in close proximity to the human
    head and body. This document supports both FDD and TDD modes. The objective of
    this document is to define the number of test conditions with respect to basic
    radio frequency aspects, i.e. channel bandwidths, number and offset of allocated
    resource blocks (RB), modulation, and maximum power reduction (MPR) for IEC 62209-1
    and IEC 62209-2. This PAS is a technical specification not fulfilling the requirements
    for a standard, but made available to the public.
