abstract:
- content: "<p>This document:</p><p>— provides risk management elaborations for the
    processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,</p><p>— provides
    the users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and their associated elaboration
    standards with common terminology and specialized guidance for performing risk
    management within the context of systems and software engineering projects,</p><p>—
    specifies the required information items that are to be produced through the implementation
    of risk management process for claiming conformance, and</p><p>— specifies the
    required contents of the information items.</p><p>This document provides a universally
    applicable standard for practitioners responsible for managing risks associated
    with systems and software over their life cycle. This document is suitable for
    the management of all risks encountered in any organization or project appropriate
    to the systems or software projects regardless of context, type of industry, technologies
    utilized, or organizational structures involved.</p><p>This document does not
    provide detailed information about risk management practices, techniques, or tools
    which are widely available in other publications. Instead this document focuses
    on providing a comprehensive reference for integrating the large and wide variety
    of processes, practices, techniques, and tools encountered in systems and software
    engineering projects and other lifecycle activities into a unified approach for
    risk management, with the purpose of providing effective and efficient risk management
    while meeting the expectations and requirements of organization and project stakeholders.</p>"
