abstract:
- content: "IEC 63240-2:2020 specifies the AAL architecture model.<br />\r\nThis document
    defines concepts and introduces terminology. IEC 63240-1 provides generic rules
    for designers of AAL systems and services with the aim to facilitate systems design
    and enable interoperability between components. This document provides a framework
    to analyse use cases on a common view and terminology, which is a foundation for
    communication to discuss the interoperability of the components of the AAL system.
    This document allows for the mapping of defined AAL use cases and supports the
    identification of interoperability issues and gap analysis of the standards.<br
    />\r\nThis document also identifies safety, security, privacy, and other requirements
    for AAL systems such as usability, accessibility, and trustworthiness (reliability,
    resilience)."
