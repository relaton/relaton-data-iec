  content: "IEC TR 61292-6:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 61292-6:2023
    which is a Technical Report, relates to distributed Raman amplification (DRA).
    Its main purpose is to provide background material for future standards related
    to DRA, such as specifications, test methods and operating procedures. This document
    covers the following aspects:<br />\r\n- general overview of Raman amplification;<br
    />\r\n- applications of DRA;<br />\r\n- performance characteristics and test methods
    related to DRA;<br />\r\n- operational issues relating to the deployment of DRA.<br
    />\r\nAs DRA is a relatively new technology, and still rapidly evolving, some
    of the material in this document can become obsolete or irrelevant in a fairly
    short period of time. This document will be updated frequently to minimize this
    possibility. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- correction of the formula for noise figure;<br />\r\n- correction of errors
    in Figure 10."
