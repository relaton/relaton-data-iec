abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62002-4:2009(E) gives a standard method to test Total Radiated Sensitivity
    (TRS) of a category c) terminal specified in IEC 62002-1. This is a practical
    measure of the radiated sensitivity as it takes into account both the terminal
    antenna efficiency and possible terminal generated additional noise. Moreover,
    it can be used directly in the link budget calculations for the network coverage
    predictions.
