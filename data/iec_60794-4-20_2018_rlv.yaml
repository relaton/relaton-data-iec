abstract:
- content: "IEC 60794-4-20:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60794-4-20:2018
    covers optical telecommunication cables, commonly with single-mode fibres used
    primarily in overhead power lines applications. The cables can also be used in
    other overhead utility networks, such as for telephony or TV services. Requirements
    of the sectional specification IEC 60794-4 for aerial optical cables along electrical
    power lines are applicable to cables covered by this document. This document covers
    the construction, mechanical, electrical, and optical performance, installation
    guidelines, acceptance criteria, test requirements, environmental considerations,
    and accessories compatibility for an all dielectric, self-supporting fibre optic
    (ADSS) cable. This document provides construction and performance requirements
    that ensure, within the guidelines of this document, that the required mechanical
    integrity of the cable components as well as optical fibre mechanical reliability
    and transmission parameters are maintained. The ADSS cable consists of single
    mode optical fibres contained in one or more protective dielectric fibre optic
    units surrounded by or attached to suitable dielectric strength members and sheaths.
    The cable does not contain metallic components. An ADSS cable is designed to meet
    the optical and mechanical requirements under different installation, operating
    and environmental conditions and loadings, as described in Annex B. This document
    excludes any \"lashed\" or \"wrapped\" OPAC cables included in IEC 60794-4. Figure
    8 aerial cables are also excluded; they are specified in IEC 60794-3-20. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012 and constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- this document has been
    streamlined by cross-referencing IEC 60794-1-1,<br />\r\n- IEC 60794-4 (all parts)
    and IEC 60794-1-2;<br />\r\n- reference to the MICE table has been deleted;<br
    />\r\n- the example of test method for particular environment in Annex C has been
    deleted;<br />\r\n- creep test method has been updated in Annex E.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords:
    optical telecommunication cables, single-mode fibres used primarily in overhead
    power lines"
