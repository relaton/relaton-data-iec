    <p>The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a description of a mechanism for transferring</p>
    <p>information between modelling tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing and</p>
    <p>exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform to CDIF. The language that is defined for</p>
    <p>the Transfer Format also has applicability as a general language for Import/Export from repositories. The CDIF</p>
    <p>Semantic Metamodel defined for modelling tools also has applicability as the basis of standard definitions for use in</p>
    <p>repositories.</p>
    <p>The standards, which form the complete family of CDIF Standards, are documented in ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002,</p>
    <p><i>Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 1: Overview. </i>These standards cover the overall framework,</p>
    <p>the transfer format and the CDIF Semantic Metamodel.</p>
    <p/>
    <p>The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the various standards that comprise the CDIF family of standard. The shaded box</p>
    <p>depicts this Standard and its position in the CDIF family of standard.</p>
    <p>This document describes the way that CDIF metamodels are concretely represented during a transfer and the way</p>
    <p>that CDIF supports multiple exchange syntaxes and encodings. No specific exchange syntaxes or encodings are</p>
    <p>described in this document. ISO/IEC 15475-2:2002, <i>Information technology — CDIF transfer format — Part 2:</i></p>
    <p><i>Syntax SYNTAX.1 </i>and ISO/IEC 15475-3:2002, <i>Information technology — CDIF transfer format —Part 3: Encoding</i></p>
    <p><i>ENCODING.1. </i>define one specific CDIF syntax and one specific CDIF encoding.</p>
    <p>This document is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document provides</p>
    <p>an introduction to the entire CDIF family of standard. It is suitable for:</p>
    <p>— Those evaluating CDIF,</p>
    <p>— Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and</p>
    <p>— Those developing importers and exporters.</p>
    <p>The documents ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002, <i>Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 1: Overview </i>and</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002, <i>Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 2: Modelling and extensibility </i>should be</p>
    <p>read first when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read other documents in the CDIF family of</p>
    <p>standard.</p>
    <p>While there are no specific prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful for the reader to have familiarity</p>
    <p>with the following:</p>
    <p>— Entity-Relationship-Attribute modelling;</p>
    <p>— Modelling (CASE) tools;</p>
    <p>— Information repositories;</p>
    <p>— Data dictionaries;</p>
    <p>— Multiple meta-layer modelling;</p>
    <p>— Formal grammars;</p>
    <p>— Transfer formats.</p>
