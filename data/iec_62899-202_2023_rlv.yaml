abstract:
- content: "IEC 62899-202:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62899-202:2023
    defines the terms and specifies the standard test methods for characterization
    and evaluation of conductive inks. This document also provides measurement methods
    for evaluating the properties of conductive layers made both from an additive
    process using conductive inks and from a subtractive process used in printed electronics.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) definitions of conductive material, conductive
    ink and conductive layer have been revised;<br />\r\nb) a summary of test methods
    is added;<br />\r\nc) mechanical tests for conductive layer are added."
