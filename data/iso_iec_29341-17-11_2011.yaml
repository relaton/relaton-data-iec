abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-17-11:2011 describes the service-type that enables modelling of 'Quality
    of Service Manager' function capabilities. This service provides a mechanism for
    a Control Point to:<br />\r\n- Be agnostic of the QoS capabilities and associated
    details about the various QoS Devices on the network at the expense of potential
    network inefficiency.<br />\r\n- Abstract the tasks of setting up, modifying and
    revoking the QoS associated with every traffic stream.<br />\r\n- QosManager:3
    defines new capabilities to set up Parameterized QoS. Control Points may now request
    reservations for specific resources for the exclusive use of individual streams.
    Successful resource reservation ensures that streams will always have the bandwidth
    and other resources to transport time critical data.<br />\r\n- QosManager:3 defines
    a method for Control Points to request preemption of existing reservations on
    the UPnP-QoS network if necessary to admit a new stream.<br />\r\n- QosManager:3
    supports a mechanism for providing a list of blocking streams to a Control Point
    so that it can handle preemption on its own, if desired. This service definition
    is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0."
