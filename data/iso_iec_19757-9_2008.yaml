abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19757-9:2008 defines a language that is designed to extend
    the declarative functionality of an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) to include</p><ul><li>declaring
    one or more namespaces to which some or all of the element and attribute names
    in a DTD belong,</li><li>declaring constraints on the content of elements with
    content model ANY to contain elements whose names belong to one or more specified
    namespaces,</li><li>declaring datatypes for elements that contain data content
    only and for attribute values.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 19757-9:2008 defines two alternative
    syntax bindings for this language. The first syntax binding uses XML processing
    instructions and is designed to enable declarations in this language to be embedded
    within an XML DTD without invalidating the DTD or altering its interpretation
    so far as legacy DTD parsers are concerned. This first syntax also provides a
    means of associating a DTD with an external declarations subset containing declarations
    in either syntax. This syntax is defined using the modified BNF syntax notation
    used in W3C XML. The second defined syntax binding uses an XML document syntax.
    The syntax rules are defined by a schema that conforms to the RELAX NG Compact
    Syntax defined in ISO/IEC 19757-2. This syntax is designed to enable declarations
    in this language to be expressed almost entirely in XML (in this case one XML
    processing instruction needs to be inserted in the DTD) to facilitate implementation
    using existing XML tools, either as a namespace-qualified fragment embedded within
    an XML instance or as a separate XML document.</p>"
