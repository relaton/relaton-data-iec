abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19757-9:2008 defines a language that is designed to extend the
    declarative functionality of an XML Document Type Definition (DTD) to include<br
    />\r\n\tdeclaring one or more namespaces to which some or all of the element and
    attribute names in a DTD belong,<br />\r\n\tdeclaring constraints on the content
    of elements with content model ANY to contain elements whose names belong to one
    or more specified namespaces,<br />\r\n\tdeclaring datatypes for elements that
    contain data content only and for attribute values.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 19757-9:2008 defines two alternative syntax bindings for this language.
    The first syntax binding uses XML processing instructions and is designed to enable
    declarations in this language to be embedded within an XML DTD without invalidating
    the DTD or altering its interpretation so far as legacy DTD parsers are concerned.
    This first syntax also provides a means of associating a DTD with an external
    declarations subset containing declarations in either syntax. This syntax is defined
    using the modified BNF syntax notation used in W3C XML. The second defined syntax
    binding uses an XML document syntax. The syntax rules are defined by a schema
    that conforms to the RELAX NG Compact Syntax defined in ISO/IEC 19757-2. This
    syntax is designed to enable declarations in this language to be expressed almost
    entirely in XML (in this case one XML processing instruction needs to be inserted
    in the DTD) to facilitate implementation using existing XML tools, either as a
    namespace-qualified fragment embedded within an XML instance or as a separate
    XML document."
