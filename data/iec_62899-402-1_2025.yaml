abstract:
- content: "IEC 62899-402-1:2025 specifies the measurement methods of the width of
    line pattern and spaces between the line patterns in printed electronics. These
    printed line patterns are treated as two-dimensional on a substrate. When the
    patterns are definitely affected by three-dimensional configurations, these are
    specified in measurement methods for vertical variance in printed electronics.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The title is changed from 'Printability –
    Measurement of qualities – Pattern width' to 'Printability – Measurement of qualities
    – Line pattern width'<br />\r\nb) The term 'pattern width' is specified as 'line
    pattern width'.<br />\r\nc) The measurement method of line pattern space is included.<br
    />\r\nd) The definition and measurement of inner/outer edge lines are removed."
