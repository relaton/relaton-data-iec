    />\r\nIEC 61439-4:2023 defines the specific requirements of ACS as follows:<br
    />\r\n- assemblies for which the rated voltage does not exceed 1 000 V in case
    of AC or 1 500 V in case of DC;<br />\r\n- assemblies where the nominal primary
    voltage and the nominal secondary voltage of transformers incorporated in ACS
    are within the limits specified above;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for use
    on construction sites, both indoors and outdoors, i.e. temporary places of work
    to which the public do not generally have access and where building construction,
    installation, repairs, alteration or demolition of property (buildings) or civil
    engineering (public works) or excavation or any other similar operations are carried
    out;<br />\r\n- transportable (semi-fixed) or mobile ASSEMBLIES with enclosure.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition of IEC 61439-4 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 61439-1:2020 regarding the structure and
