  content: "IEC 60335-2-107:2017+A1:2020+A2:2021 specifies safety requirements and
    their verification for the design and construction of robotic battery powered
    electrical rotary lawnmowers and their peripherals with the rated voltage of the
    battery being not more than 75 V d.c. EMC and environmental aspects, except noise,
    have not been considered in this standard. This document does not apply to the
    additional risks associated with internal combustion engine(s), hybrid and fuel
    cell powered machines and associated charging systems. This document deals with
    all the significant hazards presented by battery powered robotic lawnmowers and
    their peripherals when they are used as intended and under conditions of misuse
    which are reasonably foreseeable. Throughout this document, the term machine is
    used to refer to the robotic lawnmower, separate from its charging station. This
    document also provides requirements for the safety of mains powered charging stations
    and signal sources for perimeter delimiters. Additional battery operation and
    charging requirements for robotic lawnmowers, including the charging of lithium
    ion batteries, are specified in Annex KK which replaces Annexes B and S (except
    for requirements for non-rechargeable batteries) of Part 1. This document is not
    applicable to machines which are manufactured before the date of publication of
    this document by IEC. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- Clause 7: Markings and instructions, new requirements for
    markings, warnings and the instruction manual;<br />\r\n- Clause 8: Protection
    against access to live parts, new requirements for protection against electric
    shock for hazardous battery voltages;<br />\r\n- Clause 20: Stability and mechanical
    hazards, revised requirements for manual controller, manual stop, cutting means
    stopping time, traction drive stopping and restart procedures, as well as a new
    standing child foot probe test;<br />\r\n- Clause 22: Construction, revised requirements
    for disabling devices, working area, perimeter delimiter, sensors and manual controller,
    as well as new requirements for machine connectors used for charging and contact
    surfaces used as obstruction sensing devices;<br />\r\n- Clause 24: Components,
    revised requirements for switches and<br />\r\n- Clause 29: Clearances, creepage
    distances and solid insulation, revised requirements for the machine and non-mains-powered
    peripherals.<br />\r\nThis standard series is a product family standard series
    dealing with the safety of appliances and takes precedence over horizontal and
    generic standards covering the same subject. This publication is to be used in
    conjunction with the fifth edition (2010) of <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/61880\">IEC
    60335-1</a> and its amendments.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: Hand-held tools,
    Robotic Battery Powered Electrical Lawnmowers, Safety"
