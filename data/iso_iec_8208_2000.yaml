abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the procedures, formats and</p><p>facilities
    at the Packet Layer for Data Terminal Equipment (DTE)</p><p>operating in conformance
    with ITU-T Recommendation X.25.</p><p>Both Virtual Call and Permanent Virtual
    Circuit modes of</p><p>operation are covered.</p><p>The Packet Layer protocol
    specified herein can be used in both</p><p>Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
    and non-OSI environments.</p><p>When used within the context of OSI, the Packet
    Layer protocol</p><p>is encompassed in the Network Layer of the OSI Reference</p><p>Model,
    ITU-T Rec. X.200 | ISO/IEC 7498-1.</p><p>This International Standard covers DTE
    operation at the Packet</p><p>Layer when accessing a public or private packet-switched</p><p>network
    conforming to ITU-T Recommendation X.25 by means</p><p>of a dedicated path or
    a circuit-switched connection. It also</p><p>covers the additional Packet Layer
    procedures necessary for two</p><p>DTEs conforming to this International Standard
    to communicate</p><p>directly (i.e., without an intervening packet-switched network)</p><p>over
    a dedicated path, a circuit-switched connection, or a local</p><p>area network
    (LAN).</p><p>This International Standard also covers private networks that use</p><p>ITU-T
    Recommendation X.25 to connect to packet-switched</p><p>public data networks and
    that may also offer an X.25 interface to</p><p>a DTE (see annex A).</p><p>To evaluate
    conformance of a particular implementation, it is</p><p>necessary to have a statement
    of which capabilities and options</p><p>have been implemented. Such a statement
    is called a Protocol</p><p>Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS), as defined
    in</p><p>ITU-T Rec. X.290 | ISO/IEC 9646-1. Annex B provides the PICS</p><p>proforma
    in accordance with the relevant guidance given in ITUT</p><p>Rec. X.296 | ISO/IEC
    9646-7.</p><p>The first edition of this International Standard was based on the</p><p>1984
    CCITT Red Book text of Recommendation X.25. It also</p><p>contained the necessary
    provisions for compatibility with the</p><p>earlier 1980 CCITT Yellow Book text
    of Recommendation X.25.</p><p>The second edition was based on the 1988 CCITT Blue
    Book</p><p>text of Recommendation X.25. The third edition is based upon</p><p>the
    1993 version of X.25. This fourth edition is based on the</p><p>1996 version of
    X.25. Retained within this fourth edition are the</p><p>necessary provisions for
    compatibility with the 1993, 1988, 1984</p><p>and 1980 versions of X.25. The differences
    between various</p><p>editions of this International Standard are summarized in
    annex</p><p>C.</p><p>CCITT Recommendation X.613 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10588: 1993,</p><p><em>Information
    technology</em><em>Use of X.25 Packet Layer Protocol in</em></p><p><em>conjunction
    with X.21/X.21bis to provide the OSI connectionmode</em></p><p><em>Network Service</em></p><p>CCITT
    Recommendation X.614 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10732: 1993,</p><p><em>Information technology</em><em>Use
    of X.25 Packet Layer Protocol to</em></p><p><em>provide the OSI connection-mode
    Network Service over the</em></p><p><em>telephone network</em></p>"
