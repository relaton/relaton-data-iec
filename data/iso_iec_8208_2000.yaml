abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    8208:2000 This International Standard specifies the procedures, formats and facilities
    at the Packet Layer for Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) operating in conformance
    with ITU-T Recommendation X.25.<br />\r\nBoth Virtual Call and Permanent Virtual
    Circuit modes of operation are covered.<br />\r\nThe Packet Layer protocol specified
    herein can be used in both Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) and non-OSI environments.<br
    />\r\nWhen used within the context of OSI, the Packet Layer protocol is encompassed
    in the Network Layer of the OSI Reference Model, ITU-T Rec. X.200 | ISO/IEC 7498-1.<br
    />\r\nThis International Standard covers DTE operation at the Packet Layer when
    accessing a public or private packet-switched network conforming to ITU-T Recommendation
    X.25 by means of a dedicated path or a circuit-switched connection. It also covers
    the additional Packet Layer procedures necessary for two DTEs conforming to this
    International Standard to communicate directly (i.e., without an intervening packet-switched
    network) over a dedicated path, a circuit-switched connection, or a local area
    network (LAN).<br />\r\nThis International Standard also covers private networks
    that use ITU-T Recommendation X.25 to connect to packet-switched public data networks
    and that may also offer an X.25 interface to a DTE (see annex A).<br />\r\nTo
    evaluate conformance of a particular implementation, it is necessary to have a
    statement of which capabilities and options have been implemented. Such a statement
    is called a Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS), as defined in
    ITU-T Rec. X.290 | ISO/IEC 9646-1. Annex B provides the PICS proforma in accordance
    with the relevant guidance given in ITUT Rec. X.296 | ISO/IEC 9646-7.<br />\r\nThe
    first edition of this International Standard was based on the 1984 CCITT Red Book
    text of Recommendation X.25. It also contained the necessary provisions for compatibility
    with the earlier 1980 CCITT Yellow Book text of Recommendation X.25.<br />\r\nThe
    second edition was based on the 1988 CCITT Blue Book text of Recommendation X.25.
    The third edition is based upon the 1993 version of X.25. This fourth edition
    is based on the 1996 version of X.25. Retained within this fourth edition are
    the necessary provisions for compatibility with the 1993, 1988, 1984 and 1980
    versions of X.25. The differences between various editions of this International
    Standard are summarized in annex C.<br />\r\nCCITT Recommendation X.613 (1992)
    | ISO/IEC 10588: 1993, Information technology Use of X.25 Packet Layer Protocol
    in conjunction with X.21/X.21bis to provide the OSI connectionmode Network Service
    CCITT Recommendation X.614 (1992) | ISO/IEC 10732: 1993, Information technology
    Use of X.25 Packet Layer Protocol to provide the OSI connection-mode Network Service
    over the telephone network"
