- content: "IEC 61558-2-10:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 61558-2-10:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 61558-1:2017.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-10:2024 deals with the safety
    of separating transformers with high insulation level and separating transformers
    with output voltages exceeding 1 000 V. Transformers incorporating electronic
    circuits are also covered by this document. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) adjustment of structure and references in
    accordance with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\nb) overvoltage categories I, II, III
    and IV for clearances and dielectric strength tests are included;<br />\r\nc)
    clearances for homogenous field conditions deleted.<br />\r\nIt has the status
    of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
