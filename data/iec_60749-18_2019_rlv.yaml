abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-18:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60749-18:2019
    provides a test procedure for defining requirements for testing packaged semiconductor
    integrated circuits and discrete semiconductor devices for ionizing radiation
    (total dose) effects from a cobalt-60 (60Co) gamma ray source. Other suitable
    radiation sources can be used. This document addresses only steady-state irradiations,
    and is not applicable to pulse type irradiations. It is intended for military-
    and aerospace-related applications. It is a destructive test. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- updates to subclauses to better align the test method with MIL-STD 883J,
    method 1019, including the use of enhanced low dose rate sensitivity (ELDRS) testing;<br
    />\r\n- addition of a Bibliography, which includes ASTM standards relevant to
    this test method."
