    <p>ISO/IEC 18000 has been developed to provide a framework to define common communications protocols for Internationally useable frequencies for Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), and, where possible, to determine the use of the same protocols for all frequencies such that the problems of migrating from one to another are diminished; to minimize software and implementation costs; and to enable system management and control and information exchange to be common as far as is possible. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 was prepared in accordance with the requirements determined in ISO/IEC 18000-1. ISO/IEC 18000-1 provides explanation of the concepts behind ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 has 2 MODES of operation, intended to address different applications. It summarizes the differences between MODE characteristics. The detailed technical differences between the modes are shown in the parameter tables.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 relates solely to systems operating at 13,56 MHz.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 provides physical layer, collision management system and protocol values for RFID systems for Item Identification operating at 13,56 MHz in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 18000-1.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 provides definitions for systems for each MODE determined in ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 defines two non-interfering MODES. </p>
    <ul>
    <li>The MODES are not interoperable. </li>
    <li>The MODES, whilst not interoperable, are non-interfering.</li>
    </ul>
