abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 14763-2:2019 specifies requirements for the planning, installation
    and operation of telecommunications cabling and cabling infrastructures including
    cabling, pathways, spaces and telecommunications bonds (other than that specified
    in ISO&#x2F;IEC 30129) in support of generic cabling standards and associated
    documents. The following aspects are addressed:\r\na) specification of the installation;\r\nb)
    quality assurance;\r\nc) installation planning;\r\nd) installation practice;\r\ne)
    documentation;\r\nf) administration;\r\ng) testing;\r\nh) inspection;\r\ni) operation;\r\nj)
    maintenance;\r\nk) repair.\r\nThe requirements and recommendations of Clauses
    5 to 14 are premises-independent. Annexes C through G contain premises-specific
    amendments of and additions to these requirements and recommendations.\r\nIn addition,
    this document describes the methodology for the assessment of spaces, pathways,
    pathway systems and cabling (either installed or planned) in support of remote
    powering objectives.\r\nThis document excludes specific requirements applicable
    to other cabling systems (e.g. power supply cabling); however, it takes account
    of the effects other cabling systems may have on the installation of telecommunications
    cabling (and vice versa) and gives general advice.\r\nThis document excludes those
    aspects of installation associated with the transmission of signals in free space
    between transmitters, receivers or their associated antenna systems (e.g. wireless,
    radio, microwave or satellite).\r\nThis document is applicable to certain hazardous
    environments but does not exclude additional requirements which are applicable
    in particular circumstances (e.g. electricity supply and electrified railways).\r\nSafety
    and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of
    this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information
    given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.\r\nThis
    second edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition: the inclusion of planning and installation practices
    to support remote powering over the telecommunications cabling infrastructure
    and the inclusion of planning and installation practices outside buildings."
