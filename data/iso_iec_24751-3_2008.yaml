abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    24751-3:2008 provides a common language for describing digital learning resources
    to facilitate matching of those resources to learners' accessibility needs and
    preferences (as defined in ISO/IEC 24751-2). This description is one side of a
    pair of descriptions used in matching user needs and preferences with education
    delivery (as described in ISO/IEC 24751-1).<br />\r\nISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 discusses
    the basic principles adhered to in developing this model for describing digital
    learning resources. It explains: the assumptions made in developing ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008,
    the notion of an original and adapted resource, the major categories of metadata
    for original and adapted resources, the notion of an access mode for a resource,
    what is meant by adaptability, and the importance of interoperability and the
    role played by consistent implementation in interoperability.<br />\r\nIt contains
    the information model for ISO/IEC 24751-3, including the attribute, allowed occurrence
    and datatype of each element.<br />\r\nIt defines and describes how the terms
    in the information model should be used, and explains how ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008
    can be extended.<br />\r\nIt discusses conformance to ISO/IEC 24751-3. Conformance
    is dependent on the role played by the conformant technology. Conformance requirements
    for both education delivery applications, resources and metadata authoring tools
    are explained.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 provides<br />\r\na consolidated
    list of all the terms defined in ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008, sorted in French alphabetical
    order,<br />\r\nthe ISO French language equivalent terms and definitions, and<br
    />\r\nthe codes representing the gender of the French terms.<br />\r\nThe vocabulary
    codes, values and associated rules of application are defined. An informative
    list of recommended default values for the learner preferences and needs is provided.<br
    />\r\nIt lists existing bindings of the IMS Access for All Metadata Specification
    Version 1 (ACCMD) that serves as the reference specification for ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008.<br
    />\r\nIt describes information scenarios for applying ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 and
    gives informative implementation examples.<br />\r\nUse of ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008
    will assist in matching individual learner needs in a computer-mediated learning
    environment with the necessary user interface and resources needed to meet those
    needs."
