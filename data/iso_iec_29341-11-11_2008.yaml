    29341-11-11:2008 enables modeling of QoS Manager function capabilities. QoS Manager
    functionality is a combination of QoS Manager service and control point functionality
    that discovers and controls QoS Device and QoS Policy Holder services running
    on the network. The QoS Manager function is responsible for requesting, updating,
    releasing and in general controlling the Quality of Service assigned by networking
    devices to various traffic streams. The series of ISO/IEC 29341 publications defines
    an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity of intelligent
    appliances, wireless devices and PCs. It is designed to bring easy to use, flexible,
    standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home,
    in a small business, public spaces or attached to the Internet."
