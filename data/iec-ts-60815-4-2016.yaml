  content: "IEC TS 60815-4:2016(E) which is a Technical Specification, is applicable
    as first approach for the determination of the required d.c. Unified Specific
    Creepage Distance for insulators with respect to pollution. To avoid excessive
    over or under design, existing operation experience should be compared and eventually
    additional appropriate tests may be performed by agreement between supplier and
    customer. It is applicable to:<br />\r\n- Glass and porcelain insulators;<br />\r\n-
    Composite and hybrid insulators with an HTM or non-HTM housing. This part of IEC
    60815 gives specific guidelines and principles to arrive at an informed judgement
    on the probable behaviour of a given insulator in certain pollution environments."
