abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25062:2006 provides a standard method for reporting usability
    test findings. The format is designed for reporting results of formal usability
    tests in which quantitative measurements were collected, and is particularly appropriate
    for summative/comparative testing. The CIF does not indicate how to perform a
    usability test but provides guidance on how to report the results of a usability
    test. The CIF targets two audiences: usability professionals and stakeholders
    in an organization. Stakeholders can use the usability data to help make informed
    decisions concerning the release of software products or the procurement of such
    products.</p><p>The format includes the following elements:</p><ul><li>the description
    of the product,</li><li>the goals of the test,</li><li>the test participants</li><li>the
    tasks the users were asked to perform,</li><li>the experimental design of the
    test,</li><li>the method or process by which the test was conducted,</li><li>the
    usability measures and data collection methods, and</li><li>the numerical results.</li></ul>"
