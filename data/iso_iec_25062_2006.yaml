abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 25062:2006 provides a standard method for reporting usability
    test findings. The format is designed for reporting results of formal usability
    tests in which quantitative measurements were collected, and is particularly appropriate
    for summative/comparative testing. The CIF does not indicate how to perform a
    usability test but provides guidance on how to report the results of a usability
    test. The CIF targets two audiences: usability professionals and stakeholders
    in an organization. Stakeholders can use the usability data to help make informed
    decisions concerning the release of software products or the procurement of such
    products.<br /><br />\r\nThe format includes the following elements:\r\n\r\n\tthe
    description of the product,\r\n\tthe goals of the test,\r\n\tthe test participants\r\n\tthe
    tasks the users were asked to perform,\r\n\tthe experimental design of the test,\r\n\tthe
    method or process by which the test was conducted,\r\n\tthe usability measures
    and data collection methods, and\r\n\tthe numerical results."
