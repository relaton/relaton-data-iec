abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-8-1:2020 There are two types of thermally stimulated current
    (TSC) measurement methods, classified by the origin of the current. One is generated
    by the detrapping of charges. The other one is generated by depolarization. IEC
    TS 62607-8-1:2020 focuses on the former method, and specifies the measurement
    method to be developed for determining defect states of nano-enabled metal-oxide
    interfacial devices.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62607-8-1:2020 includes:<br />\r\n– outlines
    of the experimental procedures used to measure TSC,<br />\r\n– methods of interpretation
    of results and discussion of data analysis, and<br />\r\n– case studies."
