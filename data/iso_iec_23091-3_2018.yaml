abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23091-3:2018 defines various code points and fields that establish
    properties of an audio stream that are independent of the compression encoding
    and bit rate. These properties could describe the appropriate interpretation of
    decoded audio data or could, similarly, describe the characteristics of such signals
    before the signal is compressed by an encoder that is suitable for compressing
    such an input signal.
