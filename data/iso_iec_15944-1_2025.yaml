abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document addresses the fundamental requirements
    of the commercial and legal frameworks and their environments on business transactions.
    It also integrates the requirements of the information technology and telecommunications
    environments.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">In addition to the existing strategic
    directions of "portability" and "interoperability", the added strategic direction
    of ISO/IEC JTC 1 of "cultural adaptability" is supported in this document. It
    also supports requirements arising from the public policy/consumer environment,
    cross-sectoral requirements and the need to address horizontal issues. It integrates
    these different sets of requirements. (See Figure 3)</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document allows constraints which include legal requirements, commercial and/or
    international trade and contract terms, public policy (e.g. privacy/data protection,
    product or service labelling, consumer protection), laws and regulations to be
    defined and clearly integrated into Open-edi through the BOV. This means that
    terms and definitions in this document serve as a common bridge between these
    different sets of business operational requirements, allowing the integration
    of code sets and rules defining these requirements to be integrated into business
    processes electronically.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document contains a methodology
    and tool for specifying common business practices as part of common business transactions
    in the form of scenarios, scenario attributes, roles, Information Bundles and
    Semantic Components. It achieves this by: 1) developing standard computer processable
    specifications of common business rules and practices as scenarios and scenario
    components; and thus, 2) maximizing the re-use of these components in business
    transactions.</p>'
