abstract:
- content: "IEC 61938:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61938:2018
    gives guidance on current practice for the characteristics of multimedia analogue
    interfaces to achieve interoperability between equipment from different manufacturers.
    It is not a performance standard. Recommendations for interfaces for equipment
    used in vehicles, and for analogue video interfaces for broadcast and similar
    equipment, are not given. Refer to IEC 60958 for the interconnection of digital
    signals. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) electric tolerance is standardized;<br />\r\nb) recommended value of
    output source impedance is adjusted;<br />\r\nc) value of 6 Ohms is additionally
    recommended to impedance-defined loudspeaker systems;<br />\r\nd) values in each
    table are chosen with respect to the state of the art and representative of best
    practice in industry."
