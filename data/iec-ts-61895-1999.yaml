  content: 'This technical specification describes: - test methods for measuring the
    performance of pulsed Doppler ultrasound systems; - Doppler test objects for carrying
    out these tests; and applies to - tests made on an overall pulsed Doppler ultrasound
    system, a system which is not disassembled or disconnected; - tests made on pulsed
    Doppler ultrasound systems whether they are stand-alone or as part of another
    ultrasound equipment.'
