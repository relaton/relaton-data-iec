abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-11-1:2022 applies to coaxial communication cables described
    in IEC 61196-11. It specifies the layout and style for detail specifications for
    semi-rigid coaxial communication cables with polyethylene (PE) dielectric. Semi-rigid
    coaxial communication cables with polyethylene (PE) dielectric are widely used
    in the interconnection between wireless communication equipment and antenna, as
    well as RF and microwave electronic equipment, broadcast television, microwave
    relay, navigation, etc.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 61196 is used in conjunction
    with IEC 61196-1 and IEC 61196-11, which determines the layout and style for detail
    specifications, based on the blank detail specification. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2016.This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\na. engineering
    information:<strong></strong>Maximum tensile force and average power introduced,\r\n\r\nb.
    electrical, environmental and mechanical characteristics more detailed,<br />\r\nc.
    requirements for “Content of toxic and harmful substances” introduced."
