abstract:
- content: IEC 61158-6-10:2023 provides common elements for basic time-critical and
    non-time-critical messaging communications between application programs in an
    automation environment and material specific to Type 10 fieldbus. The term “time-critical”
    is used to represent the presence of a time window, within which one or more specified
    actions are required to be completed with a defined level of certainty. Failure
    to complete specified actions within the time window risks failure of the applications
    requesting the actions, with attendant risk to equipment, plant and possibly human
    life.
