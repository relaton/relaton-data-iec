- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides requirements and guidance
    on the application of system and software engineering processes to systems for
    epidemic prevention and control.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides
    guidance that can be employed for adopting and applying system and software life
    cycle processes within an organization or a project in an epidemic emergency.
    It includes system of systems considerations in the context of epidemic emergency.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document applies to acquisition, supply, development,
    operation, maintenance, and disposal (whether performed internally or externally
    to an organization) of system or system of systems in an epidemic emergency.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">Many of the requirements and recommendations in this document
    are also applicable to other systems developed rapidly to respond to emergency
    conditions affecting the public.</p>
