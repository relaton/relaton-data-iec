abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-9:2023 This document provides requirements and guidance
    on the application of system and software engineering processes to systems for
    epidemic prevention and control.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance that
    can be employed for adopting and applying system and software life cycle processes
    within an organization or a project in an epidemic emergency. It includes system
    of systems considerations in the context of epidemic emergency.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to acquisition, supply, development, operation, maintenance,
    and disposal (whether performed internally or externally to an organization) of
    system or system of systems in an epidemic emergency.<br />\r\nMany of the requirements
    and recommendations in this document are also applicable to other systems developed
    rapidly to respond to emergency conditions affecting the public."
