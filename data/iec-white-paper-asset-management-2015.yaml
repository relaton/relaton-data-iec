  content: "Worldwide, the electricity industry is facing a number of very significant
    challenges, and the ﬁrst of these, listed by many electricity network business
    CEOs, is asset management.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile power networks in developed
    nations struggle with an equipment base nearing the end of its lifetime, those
    in developing countries wrestle with trying to identify best-practice examples
    to model their operations on. This is taking place against a background of changing
    regulatory environments, climate change, evolving consumer behaviour and new market
    dynamics.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe current lack of International Standards or guidelines
    on asset management for electrical networks will have a significant impact on
    the reliability and future viability of the electricity sector.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    White Paper explores this issue in depth. It examines asset management in the
    electricity power network sector and identiﬁes areas of asset management practice
    that could beneﬁt from International Standards.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White
    Paper was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>)
    project team on strategic asset management of power networks with support from
    N.OGEE Consultants after extensive industry consultation. Three international
    workshops, held around the world, were attended by electricity network businesses,
    equipment manufacturers, research institutions and other standards organizations.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/strategic-asset-management-power-networks\">free
    download</a>."
