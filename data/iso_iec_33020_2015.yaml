abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 33020:2015 defines a process measurement framework that supports
    the assessment of process capability, in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC
    33003. The process measurement framework provides a schema that can be used to
    construct a process assessment model conformant with ISO/IEC 33004 which can be
    used in the performance of assessment of process capability according to the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 33002. In the context of this and related standards, process capability
    is a process quality characteristic related to the ability of a process to consistently
    meet current or projected business goals.</p><p>The process measurement frameworks
    defined in ISO/IEC 33020:2015 form a structure which</p><p>a) facilitates self-assessment,</p><p>b)
    provides a basis for use in process improvement and process quality determination,</p><p>c)
    is applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization,</p><p>d)
    produces a set of process (capability) attribute ratings (process profile), and</p><p>e)
    derives a process capability level.</p>"
