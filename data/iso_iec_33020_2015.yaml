abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 33020:2015 defines a process measurement framework that supports
    the assessment of process capability, in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC
    33003. The process measurement framework provides a schema that can be used to
    construct a process assessment model conformant with ISO/IEC 33004 which can be
    used in the performance of assessment of process capability according to the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 33002. In the context of this and related standards, process capability
    is a process quality characteristic related to the ability of a process to consistently
    meet current or projected business goals. The process measurement frameworks defined
    in ISO/IEC 33020:2015 form a structure which a) facilitates self-assessment, b)
    provides a basis for use in process improvement and process quality determination,
    c) is applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization, d)
    produces a set of process (capability) attribute ratings (process profile), and
    e) derives a process capability level.
