  content: "IEC 61300-3-4:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-4:
    2022 describes the various methods available to measure the attenuation of optical
    components. It is not, however, applicable to random mate attenuation measurements
    as described in IEC 61300-3-34 and IEC 61300-3-45 nor for attenuation measurements
    of dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) devices as described in IEC 61300-3-29.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    addition of Clause 3 containing terms, definitions and abbreviated terms;<br />\r\nb)
    addition of a new LSPM measurement method, insertion method (D);<br />\r\nc) addition
    of Annex A describing attenuation measurement of multicore fibre;<br />\r\nd)
    changed reference test method to insertion C and alternative test method to substitution
    or insertion D for power meter and type 4 DUT.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of June 2023 have been included in this copy."
