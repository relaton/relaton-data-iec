  content: "IEC 61300-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-1:2022
    provides general information and guidance for the basic test and measurement procedures
    defined in IEC 61300-2 (all parts) and IEC 61300-3 (all parts) for interconnecting
    devices, passive components, mechanical splices, fusion splice protectors, fibre
    management systems and protective housings. This document is used in combination
    with the relevant specification which defines the tests to be used, the required
    degree of severity for each of them, their sequence, if relevant, and the permissible
    performance limits. In the event of conflict between this document and the relevant
    specification, the latter takes precedence. This fifth edition cancels and replaces
    the fourth edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of the information of measurement
    uncertainties in 4.2.1;<br />\r\n- change of the requirements for attenuation
    variation in 4.2.2;<br />\r\n- addition of the multimode launch conditions of
    other fibres than A1-OM2, A1-OM3, A1-OM4, A1-OM5 and A3e in 10.4;<br />\r\n- addition
    of the multimode launch conditions of the planer waveguide in 10.6;<br />\r\n-
    splitting Annex A for EF and Annex B for EAF;<br />\r\n- correction of errors
    in the definitions of encircled flux and encircled angular flux."
