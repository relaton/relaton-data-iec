abstract:
- content: "The need for Electrical Energy Storage (EES) will increase significantly
    over the coming years. With the growing penetration of wind and solar, surplus
    energy could be captured to help reduce generation costs and increase energy supply.<br
    /><br />\r\nEES will play an important role in maintaining a continuous and flexible
    power supply, while balancing the grid, integrating remote and distributed energy
    generation and meeting varying demands. The publication identifies the challenges
    and outlines available technologies. It includes recommendations on research,
    regulation and standardization.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper was developed
    with CTOs (Chief Technology Officers) of major technology companies who participate
    in the IEC MSB (Market Strategy Board) in cooperation with the German Fraunhofer
    Institute for Solar Energy and other leading experts.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC
    White Paper is available for free download."
