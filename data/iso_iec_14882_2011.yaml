abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14882:2011 specifies requirements for implementations of the C++
    programming language. The first such requirement is that they implement the language,
    and so ISO/IEC 14882:2011 also defines C++. Other requirements and relaxations
    of the first requirement appear at various places within ISO/IEC 14882:2011.<br
    /><br />\r\nC++ is a general purpose programming language based on the C programming
    language as specified in ISO/IEC 9899:1999. In addition to the facilities provided
    by C, C++ provides additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces,
    operator overloading, function name overloading, references, free store management
    operators, and additional library facilities."
