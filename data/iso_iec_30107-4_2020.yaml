abstract:
- content: "This document is a profile that provides requirements for testing biometric
    presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms on mobile devices with local biometric
    recognition.<br />\r\nThis document lists requirements from ISO/IEC 30107‑3 specific
    to mobile devices. It also establishes new requirements not present in ISO/IEC
    30107‑3. For each requirement, the profile defines an Approach in Presentation
    Attack Detection (PAD) Testing for Mobile Devices. For some requirements, numerical
    values or ranges are provided in the form of best practices.<br />\r\nThis profile
    is applicable to mobile devices that operate as closed systems with no access
    to internal results, including mobile devices with local biometric recognition
    as well as biometric modules for mobile devices.<br />\r\nOut of the scope of
    this document are the following:<br />\r\n- mobile devices solely with remote
    biometric recognition.<br />\r\nThe attacks considered in this document take place
    at the sensor during the presentation and collection of the biometric characteristics.
    Any other attacks are outside the scope of this document."
