abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a profile that provides requirements for testing biometric
    presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms on mobile devices with local biometric
    recognition.</p><p>This document lists requirements from ISO/IEC 30107‑3 specific
    to mobile devices. It also establishes new requirements not present in ISO/IEC
    30107‑3. For each requirement, the profile defines an<em>Approach in Presentation
    Attack Detection (PAD) Testing for Mobile Devices</em>. For some requirements,
    numerical values or ranges are provided in the form of best practices.</p><p>This
    profile is applicable to mobile devices that operate as closed systems with no
    access to internal results, including mobile devices with local biometric recognition
    as well as biometric modules for mobile devices.</p><p>Out of the scope of this
    document are the following:</p><p>— mobile devices solely with remote biometric
    recognition.</p><p>The attacks considered in this document take place at the sensor
    during the presentation and collection of the biometric characteristics. Any other
    attacks are outside the scope of this document.</p>"
