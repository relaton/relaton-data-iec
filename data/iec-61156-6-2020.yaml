  content: "IEC 61156-6:2020 describes the cables intended primarily for working area
    wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 (all parts). It covers cable designs comprising
    individually screened, common screened and unscreened pairs or quads. The transmission
    characteristics and the frequency range of the cables are specified at 20 °C.
    These cables can be used for various communication channels which use as many
    as four pairs simultaneously. In this sense, this document provides the cable
    characteristics required by system developers to evaluate new systems. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2010 and Amendment
    1:2012. It includes the following significant technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition:<br />\r\n- additional balance levels with respect to MICE
    implementation by certain cabling specifications;<br />\r\n- reference to current
    standards and technical reports with respect to measurement techniques and remote
    powering"
