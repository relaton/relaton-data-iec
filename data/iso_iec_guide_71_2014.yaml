abstract:
- content: "The Guide is freely available for download at  ISO/IEC Guide 71:2014<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 71:2014 provides guidance to standards developers on
    addressing accessibility requirements and recommendations in standards that focus,
    whether directly or indirectly, on systems (i.e. products, services and built
    environments) used by people. To assist standards developers to define accessibility
    requirements and recommendations, it presents a summary of current terminology
    relating to accessibility, issues to consider in support of accessibility in the
    standards development process, a set of accessibility goals (used to identify
    user accessibility needs), descriptions of (and design considerations for) human
    abilities and characteristics, and strategies for addressing user accessibility
    needs and design considerations in standards."
