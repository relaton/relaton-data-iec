abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61292-9:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 61292-9:2023
    which is a Technical Report, describes the characteristic features of semiconductor
    optical amplifiers (SOAs), including the specific features of gain ripple and
    polarization dependent gain (PDG). This document focuses on amplifying applications
    of SOAs. Other applications, such as modulation, switching and non-linear functions,
    are not covered. Potential applications of SOAs, such as reflective SOAs (RSOAs)
    for the seeded wavelength division multiplexing passive optical network (WDM-PON),
    are reviewed in Annex A. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- revised definitions for SOAs in 3.1;<br />\r\n- added more
    theoretical background on gain ripple measurements using amplified spontaneous
    emission (ASE) spectrum in 4.3;<br />\r\n- removed the formerly preferred set-up
    for output power and PDG measurements in Clause 5."
