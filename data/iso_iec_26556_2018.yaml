abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26556:2018 This document, within the methods and tools of organizational
    management for software and systems product lines:<br />\r\n- enables the users
    of this document to holistically understand, adopt and enact the processes, tools
    and methods for product line organizational management;<br />\r\n- helps the users
    evaluate and select relevant tools and methods based on business and user-related
    criteria;<br />\r\n- helps make product line engineers, developers and tool vendors
    informed about capabilities of tools and methods that are required for supporting
    product line implementation from organizational aspects; and<br />\r\n- provides
    product line-specific processes and capabilities of tools and methods in organizational
    management.<br />\r\nThis document concerns processes and capabilities of methods
    and tools for organizational management for a family of products, not for a single
    system.<br />\r\nNOTE System Architecture is a set of logical and physical principles
    used to achieve a mission within a given environment. Components that can be subsystems
    derived from System Architecture are: software products, human-based products
    such as crew or operators, or hardware products like mechanical structures, electronic
    boards and chemicals. The scope of this document spans from the system to subsystems
    and components. Both hardware-intensive and software-intensive systems are included,
    if they are part of a product family."
