  content: "<p>This document provides specifications for non-invasive attack test
    tools and provides information about how to operate such tools. The purpose of
    the test tools is the collection of signals (i.e. side-channel leakage) and their
    analysis as a non-invasive attack on a cryptographic module implementation under
    test (IUT).</p>"
