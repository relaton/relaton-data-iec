abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62699:2011(E) is a technical report. It contains a series of case
    studies for the evaluation of electromagnetic (EM) sources in the frequency range
    100 kHz - 300 GHz to support the methods detailed in the international standard
    IEC 62232, Determination of RF field strength and SAR in the vicinity of radiocommunication
    base stations for the purpose of evaluating human exposure. Using the methods
    detailed in the standard, each case study has been chosen to illustrate a typical
    radio base station (RBS) evaluation scenario. Some of the case studies demonstrate
    more than one evaluation method. However, in most situations only one method would
    be required to complete an evaluation. The case studies documented in this report
    are provided for guidance only and are not a substitute for a thorough understanding
    of the requirements of IEC 62232. This publication contains attached files in
    the form of a CD-ROM for the paper version and embedded files for the electronic
    version. These files are intended to be used as a complement and do not form an
    integral part of the standard.
