abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62786-1:2023, which is a Technical Specification, provides principles
    and general technical requirements for distributed energy resources (DER) connected
    to an electric power network (in the following: the \"network\"). It applies to
    the planning, design, operation and connection of DER to networks. It includes
    general requirements, connection scheme, choice of switchgear, normal operating
    range, immunity to disturbances, active power response to frequency deviations,
    reactive power response to voltage changes, EMC and power quality, interface protection,
    connection and start to generate electrical power, active power management, monitoring,
    control and communication, and conformance tests.<br />\r\nIt is supplemented
    by additional parts of IEC 62786 series, covering specific aspects.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies interface and interoperability requirements for connection
    of DER to a network operating at a nominal frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz. These
    requirements are intended for application at the point of connection (POC) of
    the DER to the grid. In some situations, the requirements can be the applied at
    the AC terminals of the generator. Additional parts of IEC 62786 provide more
    specific requirements.<br />\r\nDER include distributed generation and electrical
    energy storage in the form of synchronous generators, asynchronous generators,
    power converters, etc., connected to the medium voltage (MV) or low voltage (LV)
    network."
