    <p>This International Standard is intended to facilitate user selection of an image scanner. This International Standard</p>
    <p>specifies the minimum information that shall be included by manufacturers in their specification sheets for scanners.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is made for the average end user. For this reason it does not describe all specifications</p>
    <p>of scanners with special features such as double sided scanning or high speed. By insuring consistency of</p>
    <p>specification of scanner product information, this International Standard enables the end user to make meaningful</p>
    <p>comparisons of machine functionality and performance characteristics. The most meaningful parameters of function</p>
    <p>and performance are specified and defined, and measures of performance are provided.</p>
    <p>This International Standard further applies to types of scanners which are most prevalent in use, including</p>
    <p>parameters for a scanning engine (an optomechanical physical device) and basic image processing only (those</p>
    <p>processes include digital data output with encoded gray scale, or unencoded single bit plus halftone data). It does not</p>
    <p>require specification of advanced application processing such as OCR, translation, vector conversion, etc. Because</p>
    <p>scanners use both software and/or hardware to achieve some scanner functions and controls, the standard contains</p>
    <p>some entries related to software even though the standard is primarily for scanner hardware. The manufacturer, at</p>
    <p>his option, may include description of such additional functionality which may be provided. This standard also does</p>
    <p>not consider image quality, nor does it provide or use related test targets.</p>
