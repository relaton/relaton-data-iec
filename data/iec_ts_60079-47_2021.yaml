abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-47:2021(E), which is a technical specification, specifies requirements
    for the construction, marking and documenting of apparatus, systems and installations
    for use with the 2-Wire Intrinsically Safe Ethernet concept (2-WISE), such as
    the physical layer specification for 2-Wire Ethernet 10BASE-T1L as defined in
    IEEE 802.3cg.<br />\r\n2-WISE is a concept for an advanced physical layer (APL),
    designed to simplify the examination process for intrinsic safety parameters of
    components and cabling within APL segments. This is achieved by defining universal
    intrinsic safety parameter limits for APL ports, according to the specific hazardous
    area requirements and listing a concise set of rules for the segment setup.<br
    />\r\nThe requirements for construction and installation of 2-WISE devices and
    systems are included in IEC 60079-11, IEC 60079-14, and IEC 60079-25, except as
    modified by this document. Parts of a 2-WISE device can be protected by any Type
    of Protection listed in IEC 60079-0 appropriate to the EPL for the intended hazardous
    area. In these circumstances, the requirements of this technical specification
    apply only to intrinsically safe circuits of the apparatus.<br />\r\nWhere a requirement
    of this document conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0, IEC 60079 11, IEC
    60079-14 or IEC 60079-25, the requirements of this document take precedence."
