- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>Specifies the physical and magnetic
    characteristics. Also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the recorded
    format and the recording method, thereby allowing data interchange between drives
    by means of such magnetic tape cartridges. Specifies two types of cartridges referred
    to as type A (magnetic tape of nominal thickness of 13 µm and a nominal length
    of up to 60,5 m) and type B (magnetic tape of a nominal thickness of 9 µm and
    a nominal length of up to 92,0 m).</p>
