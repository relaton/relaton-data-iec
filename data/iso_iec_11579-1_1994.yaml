abstract:
- content: "<p>Specifies PINX reference configuration, reference points, use of the
    PINX reference configuration. The configuration specified is not intended to require
    any specific implementation of a PINX, but only to provide guidance for the specification
    of PINX capabilities. It is sufficient to support ISDN-like applications and can
    be extended to also support non-ISDN-like application. It describes a conceptual
    PINX. By combining multiple PINXs to a private integrated services network it
    becomes applicable to a PISN.</p>"
