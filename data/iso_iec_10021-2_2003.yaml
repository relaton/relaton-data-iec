abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 10021-2:2003 ITU-T Rec. X.402 (1999) defines the overall architecture
    of the Message Handling System (MHS) and serves as a technical introduction to
    it. ISO/IEC 10021-2:2003 ITU-T Rec. X.402 (1999) first presents abstract models
    of Message Handling, then specifies how one can configure the MHS to satisfy any
    of a variety of functional, physical, and organizational requirements. It describes
    the naming and addressing of users and distribution lists and the routing of information
    objects to them. It describes the uses the MHS may make of the Directory and how
    the MHS is realized by means of OSI. The conventions used in the definition of
    the abstract services provided by MHS components are defined. Annexes provide
    important supplemental information.
