    <p>This document provides a set of instructions for evaluation of MRPs which may incorporate contactless integrated circuits. This evaluation is an instrument to establish the ability in principle of a specific type of document to fulfil the requirements of use. It supplies a structured approach to evaluate MRPs by:</p>
    <p>—          defining reproducible stress methods to submit the document(s) under evaluation to specific stress or environmental conditions;</p>
    <p>—          defining reproducible evaluation methods to measure numerical values for specific document properties;</p>
    <p>—          defining test sequences that specify the order in which stress methods and evaluation methods are to be performed;</p>
    <p>—          defining test plans to link specific user requirements to test sequences and related parameters.</p>
    <p>It specifies the minimum criteria to be achieved in order to meet ICAO's expectations for durability of fully personalized MRPs.</p>
