  content: "ISO TS 81346-101:2025, which is a Technical Specification, provides guidelines
    for the understanding and application of the ISO 81346 and IEC 81346 reference
    designation system (RDS) for power supply systems (PS). It also specifies best
    practice for its use and implementation depending on the user and situation. The
    application of this document supports harmonization within and between the power
    supply technical domains and industries. It was developed in response to demands
    by the power supply sector for guidelines to the application of the ISO 81346
    and IEC 81346 series, in particular ISO 81346-10.<br />\r\nThe very basics of
    the RDS are not explained in this document. It is assumed that the user of this
    document already is familiar with the major concepts detailed in IEC 81346-1 and
    IEC 81346-2. These concepts include the four RDS aspects, the basic RDS semantics
    and basic RDS classification rules.<br />\r\nIntroductory examples of the use
    of the RDS can be found in Annex A and Annex B. Annex C provides an example of
    a conversion table between an example structuring system and the classes specified
    in this document and other parts of the ISO 81346 and IEC 81346 series.<br />\r\nThe
    target industries of this document, include but are not limited to: wind, photovoltaic,
    thermal, nuclear and hydropower production."
