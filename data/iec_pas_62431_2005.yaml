abstract:
- content: specifies the measurement methods for the reflectivity of electromagnetic
    wave absorbers (EMA) for the normal incident, oblique incident and each polarized
    wave in the frequency range from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. In addition, these methods
    are also equally effective for the reflectivity measurement of other materials.
