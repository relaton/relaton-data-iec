abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9995 defines a framework for the layout of all alphanumeric and
    numeric keyboards across the widest spectrum of today's and upcoming applications
    using keyboards. The functions to be performed by keyboards are grouped into three
    categories that correspond to the main physical sections of the keyboard.Application
    of ISO/IEC 9995 in the design of keyboards will provide the user with a unified,
    predictable user-machine interface by dividing the keyboard into functional areas
    and sections and allocating functions to keys.ISO/IEC 9995-1:2009 identifies the
    sections of the keyboard and specifies the general shape and relative placement
    of the sections. Spacing of keys and physical characteristics are covered, as
    are the principles governing the placement of characters and symbols on keys.
    ISO/IEC 9995-1:2009 specifies a key numbering system which applies to all types
    of numeric, alphanumeric and composite keyboards of information technology equipment.
