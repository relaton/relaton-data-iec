  content: "IEC 62153-4-7:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the triaxial tube in tube
    method. This triaxial method is suitable to determine the surface transfer impedance
    and/or screening attenuation and coupling attenuation of mated screened connectors
    (including the connection between cable and connector) and cable assemblies. This
    method could also be extended to determine the transfer impedance, coupling or
    screening attenuation of balanced or multipin connectors and multicore cable assemblies.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2015 and
    its Amendment 1:2018.This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Annex E contains informative
    information about the direct measurement of screening effectiveness of connectors;<br
    />\r\n- Annex F gives normative information about mixed mode parameters;<br />\r\n-
    Annex G contains normative information about accessories for measuring coupling
    attenuation;<br />\r\n- Annex H discusses the low frequency screening attenuation."
