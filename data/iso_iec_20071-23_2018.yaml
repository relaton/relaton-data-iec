abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance for producers, exhibitors, and distributors
    on the visual presentation of alternatives to audio information in audiovisual
    content, such as captions/subtitles.</p><p>This document provides requirements
    and recommendations that are intended to support users who are not able to use
    the audio information, prefer to use a visual representation of audio information,
    or prefer both audio and visual presentations.</p><p>NOTE Many users do not have
    a choice, for instance, when in a noisy environment (e.g. bar, restaurant, etc.).
    In these situations, the user does not select a visual presentation of audio information
    but is offered the content with captions/subtitles.</p><p>This document acknowledges
    the various needs and preferences of viewers (end users) as well as the different
    approaches to visual presentation of audio information. It applies to all presentations
    of visual alternatives to audio information intended to be presented as captions/subtitles.</p><p>This
    document does not apply to the presentation devices or transmission mechanisms
    used to deliver the content or visual presentations of audio information. These
    devices could include, but are not limited to: televisions, computers, wireless
    devices, projection equipment, DVD and home cinema equipment, video game consoles,
    and other forms of user interfaces technology. This document does not apply to
    transcoding files and formats for the various video outputs.</p><p>This document
    gives guidance on visual presentations which are delivered in the same language
    as in the audio (i.e., intra-lingual captions/subtitles) and visual presentations
    which are translated into a different language (i.e., inter-lingual captions/subtitles).
    This document does not apply to the specific process of language translation.</p><p>This
    document helps to improve accessibility. This document does not establish requirements
    on specific industries (e.g. television broadcasting, motion pictures) nor is
    it intended to supersede specific international standards within their domain.</p>"
