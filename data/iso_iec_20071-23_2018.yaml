abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20071-23:2018 This document provides guidance for producers, exhibitors,
    and distributors on the visual presentation of alternatives to audio information
    in audiovisual content, such as captions/subtitles.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    requirements and recommendations that are intended to support users who are not
    able to use the audio information, prefer to use a visual representation of audio
    information, or prefer both audio and visual presentations.<br />\r\nNOTE Many
    users do not have a choice, for instance, when in a noisy environment (e.g. bar,
    restaurant, etc.). In these situations, the user does not select a visual presentation
    of audio information but is offered the content with captions/subtitles.<br />\r\nThis
    document acknowledges the various needs and preferences of viewers (end users)
    as well as the different approaches to visual presentation of audio information.
    It applies to all presentations of visual alternatives to audio information intended
    to be presented as captions/subtitles.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to
    the presentation devices or transmission mechanisms used to deliver the content
    or visual presentations of audio information. These devices could include, but
    are not limited to: televisions, computers, wireless devices, projection equipment,
    DVD and home cinema equipment, video game consoles, and other forms of user interfaces
    technology. This document does not apply to transcoding files and formats for
    the various video outputs.<br />\r\nThis document gives guidance on visual presentations
    which are delivered in the same language as in the audio (i.e., intra-lingual
    captions/subtitles) and visual presentations which are translated into a different
    language (i.e., inter-lingual captions/subtitles). This document does not apply
    to the specific process of language translation.<br />\r\nThis document helps
    to improve accessibility. This document does not establish requirements on specific
    industries (e.g. television broadcasting, motion pictures) nor is it intended
    to supersede specific international standards within their domain."
