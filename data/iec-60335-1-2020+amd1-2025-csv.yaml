  content: "IEC 60335-1:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of electrical appliances
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nThis
    standard deals with the reasonably foreseeable hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities, or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAdditional requirements may be necessary for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft. In many countries,
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to:<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n–
    appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– audio, video and similar electronic apparatus (IEC 60065);<br />\r\n–
    medical electrical equipment (IEC 60601 series);<br />\r\n– hand-held motor-operated
    electric tools (IEC 60745 series);<br />\r\n– information technology equipment
    (IEC 60950-1);<br />\r\n– transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029
    series);<br />\r\n– audio/video, information and communication technology equipment
    (IEC 62368-1);<br />\r\n– electric motor-operated hand-held tools, transportable
    tools and lawn and garden machinery (IEC 62841 series).<br />\r\nThis sixth edition
    cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2010, Amendment 1: 2013 and
    Amendment 2:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\na) updated the text
    of this standard to align with the most recent editions of the dated normative
    references;<br />\r\nb) deleted some notes and converted many other notes, in
    whole or in part, to normative text;<br />\r\nc) changed some Annex designations
    from normative to informative;<br />\r\nd) introduced information on Guidance
    documents concerning the application of the safety requirements covered by IEC
    60335 series and on how to retrieve them;<br />\r\ne) clarified requirements for
    PELV circuits;<br />\r\nf) clarification of requirements on measurement of power
    input and rated current when they vary throughout the operating cycle;<br />\r\ng)
    replaced normative Annex S with the informative Annex S \"Guidance for the application
    of this standard on measurement of power input and current based on the requirements
    of 10.1 and 10.2 concerning the representative period\";<br />\r\nh) introduced
    and clarified mechanical strength requirements for appliances with integral pins
    for insertion into socket-outlets;<br />\r\ni) revised requirements for battery-operated
    appliances;<br />\r\nj) introduced requirements for metal-ion batteries including
    a new Clause 12 Charging of metal-ion batteries;<br />\r\nk) introduced the application
    of test probe 18;<br />\r\nl) introduced requirements for appliances incorporating
    appliance outlets and socket-outlets accessible to the user;<br />\r\nm) revised
    and clarified requirements for appliances incorporating a functional earth;<br
    />\r\nn) introduced moisture resistance test requirements for appliances that
    incorporate an automatic cord reel and that have a second numeral IP rating;<br
    />\r\no) clarified the appliance test criteria for the moisture resistance for
    appliances and parts of appliances with integral pins for insertion into socket-outlets;<br
    />\r\np) introduced limits on the output voltage of an accessible safety extra-low
    voltage outlet or connector or Universal Serial Bus (USB) under abnormal operation
    conditions;<br />\r\nq) introduced requirements to cover optical radiation hazards;<br
    />\r\nr) introduced external communication software management items into normative
    Annex R;<br />\r\ns) revised external communication requirements in Table R.1
    and Table R.2;<br />\r\nt) introduced in new normative Annex U cyber security
    requirements to avoid unauthorized access and the effects of transmission failures
    via remote communication through public networks.<br />\r\nThis part is to be
    used in conjunction with the appropriate part 2 of IEC 60335. The parts 2 contain
    clauses to supplement or modify the corresponding clauses in this part to provide
    the relevant requirements for each type of appliance.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition
    of IEC 60335-1 is only to be used in conjunction with parts 2 that have been established
    on the basis of this edition. The contents of the interpretation sheets 1 (2021-11)
    and 2 (2025-08), as well as the corrigendum 1 (2021-12) have been included in
    this copy."
