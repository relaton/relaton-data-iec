abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 24800-5:2011 specifies a data interchange format for the exchange
    of image collections and respective metadata between ISO/IEC 24800 (JPSearch)
    compliant repositories. It enables the synchronization of repositories across
    different devices and platforms by providing an easy and reliable data transfer
    mechanism. In particular, it provides the following functionalities: exchange
    of data between JPSearch repositories on different devices and platforms; consolidation
    of metadata generated on different systems; transferral of data to a newer and
    better system; consolidation of selected data to a centralized repository; archive
    of data in a format which will survive current products.'
