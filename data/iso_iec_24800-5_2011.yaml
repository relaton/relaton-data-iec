- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24800-5:2011 specifies a data interchange format for the exchange
    of image collections and respective metadata between ISO/IEC 24800 (JPSearch)
    compliant repositories. It enables the synchronization of repositories across
    different devices and platforms by providing an easy and reliable data transfer
    mechanism. In particular, it provides the following functionalities:</p><ul><li>
    exchange of data between JPSearch repositories on different devices and platforms;</li><li>
    consolidation of metadata generated on different systems;</li><li> transferral
    of data to a newer and better system;</li><li> consolidation of selected data
    to a centralized repository;</li><li> archive of data in a format which will survive
    current products.</li></ul>"
