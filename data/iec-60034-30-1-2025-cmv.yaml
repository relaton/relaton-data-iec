  content: "IEC 60034-30-1:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60034-30-1:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 60034-30-1:2014
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 2 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-30-1:2025 specifies efficiency classes for single-speed
    electric motors that are rated in accordance with IEC 60034‑1 or IEC 60079‑0 and
    are rated for operation on a sinusoidal either 50 Hz or 60 Hz, or both voltage
    supply.<br />\r\nThe motors within this document:<br />\r\n- have a rated power
    PN from 0,12 kW to 1 000 kW;<br />\r\n- have a rated voltage UN from 50 V up to
    and including 1 000 V;<br />\r\n- have 2, 4, 6 or 8 poles;<br />\r\n- are capable
    of continuous operation at their rated power with a temperature rise within the
    specified insulation temperature class;<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Most motors covered by
    this document are rated for duty type S1 (continuous duty). However, some motors
    that are rated for other duty cycles are still capable of continuous operation
    at their rated power, and these motors are also covered by this document.<br />\r\n-
    are marked with any ambient temperature within the range of –30 °C to +60 °C;<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 The rated efficiency and efficiency classes are based on 25 °C ambient
    temperature in accordance with IEC 60034‑2‑1.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 Motors exclusively
    rated for temperatures outside the range – 30 °C and +60 °C are considered to
    be of special construction and are consequently excluded from this document.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 4 Smoke extraction motors with a temperature class of up to and including
    400 °C are covered by this document.<br />\r\n- are marked with an altitude up
    to 4 000 m above sea level.<br />\r\nNOTE 5 The rated efficiency and efficiency
    class are based on a rating for altitudes up to 1 000 m above sea level.<br />\r\nThis
    document establishes a set of nominal efficiency values based on supply frequency,
    number of poles and motor output power. No distinction is made between motor technologies,
    supply voltage or motors with increased insulation designed specifically for converter
    operation even though not all motor technologies are capable of reaching the higher
    efficiency classes (see Table 1). This makes different motor technologies fully
    comparable with respect to their energy efficiency potential.<br />\r\nThe efficiency
    of power-drive systems is not covered by this document. Motor losses due to harmonic
    content of the supply voltage, losses in cables, filters and frequency-converters,
    are not covered.<br />\r\nMotors with flanges, feet or shafts with mechanical
    dimensions different from IEC 60072‑1 are covered by this document.<br />\r\nGeared
    motors are covered by this document including those incorporating non-standard
    shafts and flanges.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to the following:<br
    />\r\n- Single-speed motors with 10 or more poles or multi-speed motors.<br />\r\n-
    Motors with mechanical commutators (such as DC motors).<br />\r\n- Motors completely
    integrated into a machine (for example pump, fan and compressor) that cannot be
    practically tested separately from the machine even with provision of a temporary
    end-shield and drive-end bearing. This means the motor: a) shares common components
    (apart from connectors such as bolts) with the driven unit (for example, a shaft
    or housing) and b) is not designed in such a way as to enable the motor to be
    separated from the driven unit as an entire motor that can operate independently
    of the driven unit. That is, for a motor to be excluded from this document, the
    process of separation shall render the motor inoperative.<br />\r\n- Totally enclosed
    air-over machines (TEAO, IC418), i.e. totally enclosed frame-surface cooled machines
    intended for exterior cooling by a ventilating means external to the machine.
    Efficiency testing of such motors can be performed with the fan removed and the
    cooling provided by an external blower with a similar airflow rate as the original
    fan.<br />\r\n- Motors with integrated frequency converters (compact drives) when
    the motor cannot be tested separately from the converter. Energy efficiency classification
    of compact drives is based on the complete product (PDS, ie. Power Drive System)
    and is defined in IEC 61800‑9‑2.<br />\r\nNOTE 6 A motor is not excluded when
    the motor and frequency-converter can be separated, and the motor can be tested
    independently of the converter.<br />\r\n- Brake motors when the brake is an integral
    part of the inner motor construction and can neither be removed nor supplied by
    a separate power source during the testing of motor efficiency.<br />\r\nNOTE
    7 Brake motors with a brake coil that is integrated into the flange of the motor
    are covered as long as it is possible to test motor efficiency without the losses
    of the brake (for example by dismantling the brake or by energizing the brake
    coil from a separate power source).<br />\r\nWhen the manufacturer offers a motor
    of the same design with and without a brake the test of motor efficiency can be
    done on a motor without the brake. The determined efficiency may then be used
    as the rating for a motor with or without the brake.<br />\r\n- Submersible motors
    specifically designed to operate wholly immersed in a liquid.<br />\r\n- Smoke
    extraction motors with a temperature class above 400 °C.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition of IEC 60034‑30‑1 cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 60034‑30‑1
    published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Table 1 in Clause 4 revised and IE5 efficiency introduced.<br
    />\r\nb) New efficiency tables (Table 11 and Table 12) added for IE5 nominal efficiency
    limits.<br />\r\nc) Table 13 for interpolation coefficients revised based on IE5
    limits and the coefficients limited from 0,12 kW to 0,75 kW 0,12 kW to 0,55 kW.
    A linear interpolation shall be applied to obtain minimum efficiency between 0,55
    kW and 0,75 kW.<br />\r\nd) Annex A revised and added Figure A.1 showing nominal,
    rated, minimum efficiency and tolerance."
