abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the test and evaluation methods for physically
    unclonable functions (PUFs). The test and evaluation methods consist of inspection
    of the design rationale of the PUF and comparison between statistical analyses
    of the responses from a batch of PUFs or a unique PUF versus specified thresholds.</p><p>This
    document is related to ISO/IEC 19790 which specifies security requirements for
    cryptographic modules. In those modules, critical security parameters (key) and
    public security parameters (product serial number, identification code, etc.)
    are the assets to protect. PUF is one solution to avoid storing security parameters,
    thereby increasing the overall security of a cryptographic module.</p>"
