abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 1989:2014 specifies the syntax and semantics of COBOL. Its purpose
    is to promote a high degree of machine independence to permit the use of COBOL
    on a variety of data processing systems. ISO/IEC 1989:2014 specifies: - the form
    of a compilation group written in COBOL; - the effect of compiling a compilation
    group; - the effect of executing run units; - the elements of the language for
    which a conforming implementation is required to supply a definition; - the elements
    of the language for which meaning is explicitly undefined; - the elements of the
    language that are dependent on the capabilities of the processor. ISO/IEC 1989:2014
    does not specify: - the means whereby a compilation group written in COBOL is
    compiled into code executable by a processor; - the time at which method, function,
    or program runtime modules are linked or bound to an activating statement, except
    that runtime binding occurs of necessity when the identification of the appropriate
    program or method is not known at compile time; - the time at which parameterized
    classes and interfaces are expanded; - the mechanism by which locales are defined
    and made available on a processor; - the form or content of error, flagging, or
    warning messages; - the form and content of listings produced during compilation,
    if any; - the form of documentation produced by an implementor of products conforming
    to this International Standard; - the sharing of resources other than files among
    run units.'
