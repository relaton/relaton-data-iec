abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23005-2:2013 specifies syntax and semantics of the tools required
    to provide interoperability in controlling devices in real as well as virtual
    worlds. The adaptation engine (RV or VR engine), which is not within the scope
    of standardization, takes six inputs [sensory effects (SE), user's sensory effect
    preferences (USEP), sensory devices capabilities (SDC), sensor capability (SC),
    sensor adaptation preferences (SAP), and sensed information (SI)] and outputs
    sensory devices commands (SDCmd) and/or sensed information (SI) to control the
    devices in real world or virtual world objects.<br /><br />\r\nIt is applicable
    to the interfaces between the adaptation engine and the capability descriptions
    of actuators/sensors in the real world; the user's sensory preference information,
    which characterize devices and users; and the sensor adaptation preferences information,
    which characterize sensors and users, so that appropriate information to control
    devices (actuators and sensors) can be generated. User's sensory preferences,
    sensory device capabilities, sensor adaptation preferences, and sensor capabilities
    are within the scope of ISO/IEC 23005-2:2013."
