    <p>ISO/IEC 19941:2017 specifies cloud computing interoperability and portability types, the relationship and interactions between these two cross-cutting aspects of cloud computing and common terminology and concepts used to discuss interoperability and portability, particularly relating to cloud services.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19941:2017 is related to other standards, namely, ISO/IEC 17788, ISO/IEC 17789, ISO/IEC 19086‑1, ISO/IEC 19944, and in particular, references the cross-cutting aspects and components identified in ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17789 respectively.</p>
    <p>The goal of this document is to ensure that all parties involved in cloud computing, particularly CSCs, CSPs and cloud service partners (CSNs) acting as cloud service developers, have a common understanding of interoperability and portability for their specific needs. This common understanding helps to achieve interoperability and portability in cloud computing by establishing common terminology and concepts.</p>
