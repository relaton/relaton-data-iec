  content: "IEC TR 63216:2019 is to define homogeneous categories for the electromagnetic
    environments in order to harmonize as far as practicable all general rules and
    product standard requirements of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), applicable
    to low-voltage switchgear, controlgear and their assemblies with built-in electronic
    circuits.<br />\r\nThis document also addresses incorporated radiocommunication
    functions.<br />\r\nThe typical application environments for such equipment include
    the electrical distribution in infrastructure, commercial and industrial buildings
    and the control systems of machinery, including motor-driven systems.<br />\r\nThe
    primary intention of EMC requirements is to ensure the safe and reliable operation
    of the equipment, as well as the communication efficiency of the radiocommunication
    equipment within their intended environments."
