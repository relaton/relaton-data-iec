    <p><b>1.1 </b>This <b>International Standard </b>establishes <b>requirements </b>for certifying an assessment that an Ada language</p>
    <p><b>processor conforms </b>to the <b>requirements </b>of the Ada language <b>standard</b>, ISO/IEC 8652. It places <b>requirements</b></p>
    <p>on the <b>organization </b>that performs the assessment, the assessment procedures, and the <b>test suite </b>used in the</p>
    <p>assessment. Finally, it places <b>requirements </b>on the form for the <b>certificate of conformity</b>.</p>
    <p><b>1.2 </b>This <b>International Standard </b>concerns only the <b>assessment of conformity </b>to the language <b>requirements </b>of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 8652. It does not concern the assessment of any other characteristics of a language <b>processor </b>or of the</p>
    <p>construction process used by the <b>manufacturer </b>of the language <b>processor</b>.</p>
    <p>NOTE In the sense of [ISO/IEC Guide 23], the Ada language <b>standard</b>, ISO/IEC 8652, is to be regarded as a standard for</p>
    <p>a specific property rather than a comprehensive product standard.</p>
    <p><b>1.3 </b>This <b>International Standard </b>is intended to be primarily suitable for use by a <b>third party authority </b>although</p>
    <p>portions of it may also be applied by a supplier (first party) or by a user or purchaser (second party).</p>
    <p><b>1.4 </b>An Ada language <b>processor </b>may be claimed to <b>conform </b>to the <b>requirements </b>of ISO/IEC 8652 regardless of</p>
    <p>the application of this <b>International Standard</b>. This <b>International Standard </b>prescribes the method for obtaining a</p>
    <p><b>certification </b>that an Ada language processor <b>conforms </b>to ISO/IEC 8652. Customers desiring to acquire a</p>
    <p>language <b>processor </b>certified as <b>conforming </b>should explicitly require that <b>certification </b>by citing this <b>International</b></p>
    <p><b>Standard</b>.</p>
    <p><b>1.5 Certification </b>should not be construed as guaranteeing that the certified product is free of <b>non-conformities </b>or</p>
    <p>defects; it only certifies that no evidence of <b>non-conformity </b>was found during the <b>certification </b>process.</p>
