abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 60079-30-2:2025
    provides guidance for the application of electrical resistance trace heating systems
    in areas where explosive atmospheres can be present, with the exclusion of those
    classified as requiring Equipment Protection Level (EPL) Ga or Da (traditional
    relationship to Zone 0 and Zone 20 respectively). This document also provides
    guidance for explosive atmospheres incorporating the Division method of area classification
    that can be applied by some users of this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    recommendations for the design, installation, maintenance and repair of trace
    heating systems including associated control and monitoring equipment. It does
    not cover devices that operate by induction heating, skin effect heating or direct
    pipeline heating, nor those intended for stress relieving.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition of IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2 cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC/IEEE
    60079-30-2 published in 2015.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) a general
    review and updating of the first edition;<br />\r\nb) the addition of Annex I
    â€“ Other applications of trace heating in explosive atmospheres.<br />\r\nThe significance
    of changes between IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2, Edition 1.0 (2015) and IEC/IEEE 60079-30-2,
    Edition 2.0 (this document) can be found on the foreword of this document."
