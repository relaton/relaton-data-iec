abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 29110-5-1-2:2011 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). A VSE is defined
    as an enterprise, organization, department or project having up to 25 people.
    A set of standards and guides have been developed according to a set of VSEs'
    characteristics and needs. The guides are based on subsets of appropriate standards
    elements, referred to as VSE Profiles. The purpose of a VSE Profile is to define
    a subset of ISO/IEC International Standards relevant to the VSEs' context. The
    ISO/IEC 29110 series is targeted by audience. ISO/IEC TR 29110-5 is targeted to
    VSEs. ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-2:2011 provides the management and engineering guide
    to the Basic VSE Profile specifed in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through project management
    and software implementation processes. The Basic Profile is one profile of the
    Generic profile group. The Generic profile group is applicable to VSEs that do
    not develop critical software. The Generic profile group does not imply any specific
    application domain."
