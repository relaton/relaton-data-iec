abstract:
- content: IEC TR 60728-3-2:2016(E) is applicable to the measurement of 5th order
    non-linearity for active electronic equipment which carries only digitally modulated
    television signals, sound signals and signals for interactive services. This method
    of measurement is specifically applicable to MATV installations but could be applied
    to broadband and channel selective amplifiers used in all kinds of cable networks.
