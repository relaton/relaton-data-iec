    60216-6:2022 RLV&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; which contains the International Standard and
    its Redline version, showing all changes of the technical content compared to
    the previous edition.\r\n\r\nIEC 60216-6:2022 specifies the experimental and calculation
    procedures for deriving the thermal endurance characteristics, temperature index
    (TI) and relative temperature index (RTI) of an electrical insulating material
    (EIM) using the “fixed time frame method (FTFM)”. In this protocol, the ageing
    takes place for a small number of fixed times, using the appro­priate number of
    ageing temperatures throughout each time, the properties of the specimens being
    measured at the end of the relevant time interval. This differs from the procedure
    of IEC 60216-1, where ageing is conducted at a small number of fixed temperatures,
    property measurement taking place after ageing times dependent on the progress
    of ageing. The diagnostic tests employed in the fixed time frame method are restricted
    to destructive tests. The method has not yet been applied to non-destructive or
    proof test procedures. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n- clarification of definition
    of index properties vs. endurance properties;\r\n- complete rework of Annex G
    and the corresponding program."
