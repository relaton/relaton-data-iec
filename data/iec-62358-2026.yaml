  content: "IEC 62358:2026 provides standard AL values (inductance factors) and their
    tolerances of Pot, RM, ETD, E, EER, EP, PQ, PM, EC, EFD and low-profile gapped
    ferrite cores.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of AL value
    (inductance factor) and its tolerance for PM-cores;<br />\r\nb) addition of AL
    value (inductance factor) and its tolerance for EC-cores;<br />\r\nc) addition
    of AL value (inductance factor) and its tolerance for EFD-cores."
