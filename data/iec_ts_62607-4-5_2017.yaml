abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-4-5:2017(E) provides a standardized method for the determination
    of electrochemical properties of cathode nanomaterials such as lithium iron phosphate
    (LFP) for electrical energy storage devices. This method will enable the industry
    to:\r\n\r\n\tdecide whether or not a cathode nanomaterial is usable, and\r\n\tselect
    a cathode nanomaterial suitable for their application.\r\n\r\nThis document includes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\trecommendations
    for sample preparation,\r\n\toutlines of the experimental procedures used to measure
    cathode nanomaterial properties,\r\n\tmethods of interpretation of results and
    discussion of data analysis, and\r\n\tcase studies.\r\n\r\nNOTE The very purpose
    of this method is to arrive at a detailed characterization of the electrodes so
    that individual contribution of the anode and cathode for performance and degradation
    could be predicted. The method can be applied for characterization of the electrode
    working as cathode or/and as anode."
