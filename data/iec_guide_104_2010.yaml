abstract:
- content: "IEC Guide 104:2010(E) is mandatory and defines procedures for the preparation
    of safety publications in addition to ISO/IEC Guide 51, including the preparation
    and use of basic safety publications and group safety publications. Also describes
    the relationship between TCs with horizontal safety functions or group safety
    functions and product TCs. In the context of this guide, \"safety\" relates to
    the safety of persons, domestic animals, livestock and property. The main changes
    with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- updates the third
    edition, in the light of experience, to align it with IEC Guide 108;<br />\r\n-
    includes a better description of the group safety function and group safety publications
    in subclause 5.1.3;<br />\r\n- includes a clarification in Annex A of measures
    in case of a single fault condition."
