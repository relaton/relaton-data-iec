  content: "IEC 60092-376:2025 applies to screened and unscreened cables for control
    and instrumentation circuits on ships and offshore units. The cables have an extruded
    solid insulation with a voltage rating of 150/250 V (300 V) (see Clause 4) and
    are intended for fixed installations. The various types of cables are given in
    Clause 5. The construction requirements and test methods are aligned with those
    indicated in IEC 60092‑350, unless otherwise specified in this document. This
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2017. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    addition of a colour code for wires and tapes for unit identification;<br />\r\nb)
    addition of the core numbering for multicore cables;<br />\r\nc) addition of design
    and test requirements for cables to be installed in explosive atmosphere areas;<br
    />\r\nd) addition of the design and test requirements for cables to be installed
    between areas with and without explosive atmospheres."
