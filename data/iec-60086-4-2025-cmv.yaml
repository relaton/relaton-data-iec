  content: "IEC 60086-4:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60086-4:2025 edition 6.0 and the previous IEC 60086-4:2019
    edition 5.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 35 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60086-4:2025 specifies tests and requirements for primary
    lithium batteries to ensure their safe operation under intended use and reasonably
    foreseeable misuse.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth
    edition published in 2019. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Added definitions for
    leakage and venting, in addition to the test criteria;<br />\r\n- Revised overdischarge
    test;<br />\r\n- Revised marking requirements;<br />\r\n- Revised criteria for
    the child resistant packaging test;<br />\r\n- Changed the purpose of Annex F
    from \"informative\" to \"normative\";<br />\r\n- Added a new Annex G with additional
    measures against misuse of batteries not intended for consumer replacement;<br
    />\r\n- Integrated the contents of Interpretation Sheet 1 (IEC 60086-4:2019/ISH1:2020);<br
    />\r\n- In Clause 3, terms were reordered according their functions: basic terms,
    electrochemical systems, battery shapes, battery sizes, electrical characteristics,
    specifications, safety aspects, failure modes;<br />\r\n- In 6.4.4, the exemption
    for the shock acceleration for lithium primary batteries was reduced from 12 kg
    to 4,482 kg in order to reflect the fact that this is the threshold in IEC 62281,
    Test T-4, where the peak acceleration decreases below 150 gn."
