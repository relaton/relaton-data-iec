abstract:
- content: "This document describes three types of copyright protection technologies
    in use in the publishing industry:<br />\r\n- DRM free protection, i.e. technologies
    which does not rely on content encryption but rather use content fingerprinting
    or watermarking, adequate for use cases where user convenience is the top priority;<br
    />\r\n- user key-based DRM protection, adequate where user constraints are limited;<br
    />\r\n- device key-based DRM protection, adequate where the transfer of publications
    from one device to another is severely constrained."
