abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes three types of copyright protection technologies
    in use in the publishing industry:</p><p>— DRM free protection, i.e. technologies
    which does not rely on content encryption but rather use content fingerprinting
    or watermarking, adequate for use cases where user convenience is the top priority;</p><p>—
    user key-based DRM protection, adequate where user constraints are limited;</p><p>—
    device key-based DRM protection, adequate where the transfer of publications from
    one device to another is severely constrained.</p>"
