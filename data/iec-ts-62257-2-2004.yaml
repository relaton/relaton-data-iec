- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Proposes a methodological approach for the setting up and carrying out
    of socio-economic studies as part of the framework of decentralized rural electrification
    projects. Also provides some structures as technical solutions that could be recommended,
    depending on the qualitative and quantitative energy demands, consistent with
    the needs and financial situation of the customers. Proposes electrical architectures
    to technical project managers to assist them in the design of the systems.
