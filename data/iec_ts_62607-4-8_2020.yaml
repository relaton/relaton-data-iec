abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-4-8:2020 specifies a test method for the determination of
    water content in electrode nanomaterials for nano-enabled electrical energy storage
    devices, using the Karl Fischer coulometric titration method.<br />\r\nThis document
    includes:<br />\r\n- recommendations for sample preparation,<br />\r\n- outlines
    of the experimental procedures used to measure electrode nanomaterial properties,
    and<br />\r\n- methods of interpretation of results and discussion of data analysis.<br
    />\r\nIEC TS 62607-4-8:2020 is not applicable for samples that can react with
    the main components of Karl Fischer reagent and produce water, or samples that
    can react with iodine or iodide ion."
