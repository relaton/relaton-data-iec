abstract:
- content: "ISO 80369-3:2016 specifies the dimensions and requirements for the design
    and functional performance of small-bore connectors intended to be used for connections
    on enteral medical devices and accessories. NOTE 1 Enteral medical devices include
    enteral feeding sets, enteral drainage sets, enteral syringes, and patient interface
    devices including access ports. It does not specify the dimensions and requirements
    for the medical devices or accessories that use these connectors. Such requirements
    are given in particular International Standards for specific medical devices or
    accessories. It does not specify requirements for small-bore connectors that are
    used for the following:<br />\r\n- gastric suction-only medical devices;<br />\r\n-
    oral-only medical devices;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE An oral tip syringe that is not intended
    to connect to another medical device. It is intended to administer directly to
    the patient's mouth.<br />\r\n- pressurizing and depressurizing the retention
    mechanism (e.g. balloon) used to hold invasive enteral medical devices in place;<br
    />\r\n- medical devices for rectal drainage, rectal administration of medicines
    or fluid, and any other rectal access medical device;<br />\r\n- gastrointestinal
    endoscopy equipment;<br />\r\n- skin level gastrostomy medical devices. NOTE 2
    Manufacturers are encouraged to incorporate the small-bore connectors specified
    in ISO 80369-3:2016 into enteral medical devices or accessories, even if currently
    not required by the relevant particular medical device standards. It is expected
    that when the relevant particular medical device standards are revised, requirements
    for small-bore connectors, as specified in ISO 80369, will be included."
