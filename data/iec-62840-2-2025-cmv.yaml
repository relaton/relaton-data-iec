  content: "IEC 62840-2:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62840-2:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62840-2:2016
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 69 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62840-2:2025 provides the safety requirements for a battery
    swap system, for the purposes of swapping swappable battery system (SBS)/handheld-swappable
    battery system (HBS) of electric vehicles. The battery swap system is intended
    to be connected to the supply network. The power supply is up to 1 000 V AC or
    up to 1 500 V DC in accordance with IEC 60038. This document also applies to battery
    swap systems supplied from on-site storage systems (e.g. buffer batteries).<br
    />\r\nAspects covered in this document:<br />\r\n• safety requirements of the
    battery swap system and its systems;<br />\r\n• security requirements for communication;<br
    />\r\n• electromagnetic compatibility (EMC);<br />\r\n• marking and instructions;<br
    />\r\n• protection against electric shock and other hazards.<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to battery swap systems for EV equipped with one or more SBS/HBS.<br
    />\r\nThis document is not applicable to<br />\r\n• aspects related to maintenance
    and service of the battery swap station (BSS),<br />\r\n• trolley buses, rail
    vehicles and vehicles designed primarily for use off-road, and<br />\r\n• maintenance
    and service of EVs.<br />\r\nRequirements for bidirectional energy transfer are
    under consideration<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) expands the scope to encompass both swappable battery
    systems (SBS) and handheld swappable battery systems (HBS);<br />\r\nb) introduces
    stricter interoperability requirements through detailed system interface specifications
    and defined state transition protocols;<br />\r\nc) enhances data security by
    defining safety message transmission protocols and integrating telecom network
    requirements;<br />\r\nd) increases electrical safety protection levels for battery
    swap stations (BSS) with specified capacitor discharge time limits to mitigate
    electric shock risks;<br />\r\ne) introduces enhanced mechanical safety requirements
    for automated battery handling systems, with technical alignment to ISO 10218-1
    and ISO 10218-2;<br />\r\nf) strengthens overload and short-circuit protection
    for BSS through standardized testing methods and overcurrent protection specifications;<br
    />\r\ng) defines upgraded electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) standards to ensure
    system resilience against external interference, supplemented with EMC-related
    functional safety measures.<br />\r\nThis document is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 62840-1:2025."
