abstract:
- content: 'A digital signature in electronic exchange of information provides the
    same kind of facilities that are expected from a handwritten signature in paper-based
    mail. Hence it is applicable to providing entity authentication, data origin authentication,
    non-repudiation, and integrity of data. ISO/IEC 9796-3:2006 specifies digital
    signature mechanisms giving partial or total message recovery aiming at reducing
    storage and transmission overhead. ISO/IEC 9796-3:2006 specifies mechanisms based
    on the discrete logarithm problem of a finite field or an elliptic curve over
    a finite field. ISO/IEC 9796-3:2006 defines types of redundancy: natural redundancy,
    added redundancy, or both.ISO/IEC 9796-3:2006 gives the general model for digital
    signatures giving partial or total message recovery aiming at reducing storage
    and transmission overhead.ISO/IEC 9796-3:2006 specifies six digital signature
    schemes giving data recovery: NR, ECNR, ECMR, ECAO, ECPV, and ECKNR. NR is defined
    on a prime field; ECNR, ECMR, ECAO, ECPV, and ECKNR are defined on an elliptic
    curve over a finite field.'
