abstract:
- content: Provides a list of failure mechanisms and their associated activation energies
    or acceleration factors that may be used in making system failure rate estimations
    when the only available data is based on tests performed at accelerated stress
    test conditions. The method to be used is the Sum-of-the-Failure-Rates method.
