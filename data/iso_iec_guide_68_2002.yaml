abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC Guide 68:2002 provides an introduction to the development, issuance
    and operation of arrangements for the recognition and acceptance of results produced
    by bodies undertaking similar conformity assessment and related activities. The
    activities to which this guidance is intended to apply are those related to the
    conduct of unregulated marketplace transactions extending across borders from
    one country to another. While agreements among governments pertaining to transactions
    of regulated goods and services can take into account the agreements addressed
    by this Guide, the guidance provided here is introductory and general in nature
    and does not specifically address any special requirements that governmental agreements
    might generate.Some countries may be concerned about having the necessary human
    and institutional resources with respect to conformity assessment infrastructures
    which would permit them to participate in such arrangements. Guidance on the acquisition
    and development of the resources required is beyond the scope of this Guide.
