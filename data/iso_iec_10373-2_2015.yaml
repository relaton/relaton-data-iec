    ISO/IEC 10373-2:2015 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross-referenced to one or more base standards, for example ISO/IEC 7810, or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.

    ISO/IEC 10373-2:2015 defines test methods which are specific to magnetic stripe technology.
