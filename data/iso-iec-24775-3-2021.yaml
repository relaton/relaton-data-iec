  content: "<p>Storage Management Technical Specification, Part 3 Common Profiles,
    1.8.0 Rev 4 defines profiles that are supported by profiles defined in the other
    parts of this standard. The first few clauses provide background material that
    helps explain the purpose and profiles. Common port profiles are grouped together
    since they serve as transport-specific variations of a common model. The port
    profiles are followed by other common profiles.</p>"
