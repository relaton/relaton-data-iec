  content: "IEC 60335-2-62:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-62:2024
    deals with the safety of electrically operated commercial rinsing sinks used in
    commercial kitchens, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    appliances connected between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances.
    These appliances are not intended for household and similar purposes. They are
    used in areas not open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants,
    canteens, hospitals and commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries.<br
    />\r\nThe electrical part of appliances making use of other forms of energy is
    also within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by these types of appliances.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    for appliances intended to be used in tropical countries, special requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances designed primarily
    for sterilizing to clinical standards;<br />\r\n- dishwashers (IEC 60335-2-58);<br
    />\r\n- appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis
    fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2019. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion or conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1, 7.15, 11.7, 22.103, 27.2);<br />\r\nc) clarification
    that commercial electric rinsing sinks are not intended to be used in areas open
    to the public (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) alignment of some requirements with the
    standards for commercial catering appliances (Clause 1, 5.101, 11.4, 11.7, 15.1.1,
    22.101, 22.102, 22.103, 23.3, 25.3, 27.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
