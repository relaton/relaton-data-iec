abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62443-6-2:2025 specifies the evaluation methodology to support
    achieving repeatable and reproducible evaluation results for IACS components under
    evaluation against IEC 62443-4-2 requirements.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    specify the definition of a complete certification scheme or certification program.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not specify the process evaluations of the secure development
    lifecycle according to IEC 62443‑4‑1. The existing secure development lifecycle
    according to IEC 62443‑4‑1 is a prerequisite in this evaluation methodology.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not specify particular tools, e.g. for the use in vulnerability
    or penetration testing.<br />\r\nThis document does not focus on lACS components
    which were not developed according to the lifecycle process of IEC 62443‑4‑1."
