abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 21992:2003(E) specifies
    functions for using a packet network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as its
    network layer protocol and UDP and TCP as its transport layer protocols, to interconnect
    two Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) forming part of a Private
    Integrated Services Network (PISN). Interconnection is achieved by carrying the
    inter-PINX signalling protocol directly over the Transmission Control Protocol
    (TCP) and inter-PINX user information (e.g. voice) over the Real-time Transport
    Protocol (RTP), RTP being carried over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). The inter-PINX
    signalling protocol is assumed to be QSIG, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, ISO/IEC
    11582 and other International Standards.</p><p>ISO/IEC 21992:2003(E) provides
    for two types of interconnection:</p><ul><li>on-demand, where a separate TCP connection
    for QSIG is established at the start of each call and cleared down at the end
    of that call; and</li><li>semi-permanent, where a single TCP connection with an
    indefinite lifetime carries QSIG on behalf of many single calls.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    21992:2003(E) is applicable to PINXs that can be interconnected to form a PISN
    using QSIG as the inter-PINX signalling protocol.</p>
