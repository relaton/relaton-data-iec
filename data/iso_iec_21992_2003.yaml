abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21992:2003(E) specifies functions for using a packet network that uses the Internet
    Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol and UDP and TCP as its transport layer
    protocols, to interconnect two Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs)
    forming part of a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). Interconnection
    is achieved by carrying the inter-PINX signalling protocol directly over the Transmission
    Control Protocol (TCP) and inter-PINX user information (e.g. voice) over the Real-time
    Transport Protocol (RTP), RTP being carried over the User Datagram Protocol (UDP).
    The inter-PINX signalling protocol is assumed to be QSIG, as specified in ISO/IEC
    11572, ISO/IEC 11582 and other International Standards.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 21992:2003(E)
    provides for two types of interconnection:<br />\r\non-demand, where a separate
    TCP connection for QSIG is established at the start of each call and cleared down
    at the end of that call; and<br />\r\nsemi-permanent, where a single TCP connection
    with an indefinite lifetime carries QSIG on behalf of many single calls.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21992:2003(E) is applicable to PINXs that can be interconnected to form a PISN
    using QSIG as the inter-PINX signalling protocol."
