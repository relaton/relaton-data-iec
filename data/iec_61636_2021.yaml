abstract:
- content: IEC 61636:2021 (E) is an implementation-independent specification for a
    software interface to information systems containing data pertinent to the diagnosis
    and maintenance of complex systems consisting of hardware, software, or any combination
    thereof. These interfaces support service definitions for creating application
    programming interfaces (API) for the access, exchange, and analysis of historical
    diagnostic and maintenance information. This standard is published as a double
    logo IEC-IEEE standard.
