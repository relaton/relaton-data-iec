  content: IEC/PAS 62543 describes the VSC transmission technology, with a particular
    view to the issues to be considered when it is applied at voltages above 100 kV
    d.c., and power in excess of 100 MW. It provides information about the equipment
    included in a VSC transmission scheme, as well as the characteristics and performance
    that can be expected.
