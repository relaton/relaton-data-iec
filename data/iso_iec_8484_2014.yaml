    ISO/IEC 8484:2014 specifies the characteristics and location of a magnetic stripe on a savingsbook and the use of such savingsbooks for international interchange. Compatibility with international interchange systems is provided through the requirements of ISO/IEC 8484:2014, enabling a savingsbook with a magnetic stripe to be read and possibly encoded in a device that is compatible with reading identification cards used in international interchange.

    ISO/IEC 8484:2014 specifies requirements for a magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on a savingsbook, the encoding technique, and coded character sets. It also specifies the characteristics of the savingsbook cover such as stiffness, minimum size, surface irregularities, roughness, and interaction between the cover material and the magnetic stripe. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.

    Coercivity influences many of the quantities specified in ISO/IEC 8484:2014 but is not itself specified. Exposure of the savingsbook to a magnetic field is likely to destroy the recorded data.

    ISO/IEC 8484:2014 defines performance criteria for savingsbooks. No consideration is given within ISO/IEC 8484:2014 to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the savingsbook prior to test.
