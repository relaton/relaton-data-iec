abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-101:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-101:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC
    60335-2-101:2002+AMD1:2008+AMD2:2014 CSV edition 1.2. Furthermore, comments from
    IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes,
    or to clarify any part of the content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-101:2024 deals
    with the safety of electric vaporizers for household and similar use, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within
    the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n- air fresheners;<br />\r\n- insect repellers.<br
    />\r\nThey can be plugged directly into a socket-outlet or connected to the supply
    mains by means of a flexible cord and plug.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for
    appliances to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- appliances for heating liquids (IEC 60335-2-15);<br />\r\n- insect killers
    (IEC 60335-2-59);<br />\r\n- fabric steamers (IEC 60335-2-85);<br />\r\n- humidifiers
    (IEC 60335-2-98).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2014. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 7.1);<br />\r\nc) application of test probe 19 has been introduced
    (8.1.1, 8.1.3, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) addition of external accessible
    surface temperatures (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
