abstract:
- content: "ISO 80369-6:2016 specifies requirements for small-bore connectors intended
    to be used for connections in neuraxial applications. Neuraxial applications involve
    the use of medical devices intended to administer medications to neuraxial sites,
    wound infiltration anaesthesia delivery, and other regional anaesthesia procedures
    or to monitor or remove cerebro-spinal fluid for therapeutic or diagnostic purposes.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 Sites for the neuraxial application include the spine, intrathecal
    or subarachnoid space, ventricles of the brain, and the epi-, extra-, or peri-dural
    space. Neuraxial application anaesthetics can be administered regionally affecting
    a large part of the body, such as a limb, and include plexus blocks, such as the
    branchial plexus blocks or single nerve blocks. Neuraxial application procedures
    include continuous infusion of wounds with local anaesthetic agents.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 For the purposes of this part of ISO 80369, local anaesthesia injected hypodermically
    is not considered a neuraxial application.<br />\r\nEXAMPLES Intended administration
    includes intrathecal chemotherapy, local anaesthetics, radiological contrast agents,
    antibiotics, analgesics. This part of ISO 80369 specifies dimensions and requirements
    for the design and functional performance of these small-bore connectors intended
    to be used with medical devices. This part of ISO 80369 does not specify requirements
    for the medical devices or accessories that use these connectors. Such requirements
    are given in particular International Standards for specific medical devices or
    accessories.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 Manufacturers are encouraged to incorporate the small-bore
    connectors specified in this part of ISO 80369 into medical devices, medical systems,
    or accessories, even if currently not required by the relevant particular medical
    device standards. It is expected that when the relevant particular medical device
    standards are revised, requirements for small-bore connectors, as specified in
    this part of ISO 80369, will be included. Furthermore, it is recognized that standards
    need to be developed for many medical devices used for neuraxial applications.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 4 ISO 80369-1:2010, 5.8, specifies alternative methods of compliance
    with ISO 80369-1:2010, for small-bore connectors intended for use with neuraxial
    application medical devices or accessories, which do not comply with this part
    of ISO 80369."
