  content: "IEC TS 62600-30:2018(E) includes: definition and specification of the
    quantities to be determined for characterizing the power quality of a marine energy
    (wave, tidal and other water current) converter unit; measurement procedures for
    quantifying the characteristics of a marine energy (wave, tidal and other water
    current) converter.<br />\r\nThe measurement procedures are valid for a single
    marine energy converter (MEC) unit (or farm) with three-phase grid or an off-grid
    connection. The measurement procedures are valid for any size of MEC unit."
