  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19794-4:2005 specifies a data record interchange format for
    storing, recording, and transmitting the information from one or more finger or
    palm image areas within an ISO/IEC 19785-1 CBEFF data structure. This can be used
    for the exchange and comparison of finger image data. It defines the content,
    format, and units of measurement for the exchange of finger image data that may
    be used in the verification or identification process of a subject. The information
    consists of a variety of mandatory and optional items, including scanning parameters,
    compressed or uncompressed images and vendor-specific information. This information
    is intended for interchange among organizations that rely on automated devices
    and systems for identification or verification purposes based on the information
    from finger image areas. Information compiled and formatted in accordance with
    ISO/IEC 19794-4:2005 can be recorded on machine-readable media or may be transmitted
    by data communication facilities.</p>"
