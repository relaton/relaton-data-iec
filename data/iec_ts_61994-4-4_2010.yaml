    IEC 61994-4-4:2010(E) specifies the terms and definitions for single crystal wafers applied for surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices representing the state of the art, which are intended for use in the standards and documents of IEC technical committee 49. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2005. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are listed below:<br />
    - Terms and definitions are rearranged in accordance with the order of the alphabet.<br />
    - "reduced LN" is appended to terms and definitions.<br />
    - "reduced LT" is appended to terms and definitions.<br />
    - reduction process is appended to terms and definitions.
