abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 specifies iris image interchange formats for biometric
    enrolment, verification and identification systems. The image information might
    be stored as an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948
    or ISO/IEC 15444, or an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC
    15948 or ISO/IEC 15444 that might be cropped around the iris, with the iris at
    the centre, and which might incorporate region-of-interest masking of non-iris
    regions.ISO/IEC 19794-6:2011 does not establish requirements on the optical specifications
    of cameras, requirements on photometric properties of iris images, or requirements
    on enrolment processes, workflow and use of iris equipment.
