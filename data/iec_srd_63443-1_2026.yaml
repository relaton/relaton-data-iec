abstract:
- content: IEC SRD 63443-1:2026 covers the terms and definitions, system composition
    and a service scenario of Distributed Energy Resource Aggregation Business (ERAB)
    System that is the convergence of Distributed Energy Resource (DER) units, Controllable
    loads, ERAB Controller, and a smart volt-ampere meter to measure the performance
    of the ERAB Controller, separating to Virtual Power Plant whose definition is
    the group of distributed energy resources which combine to function as a dispatchable
    unit.
