abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29109-8:2011 specifies elements of conformance testing methodology,
    test assertions, and test procedures as applicable to ISO/IEC 19794-8:2006.It
    establishestest assertions of the structure of the finger pattern skeletal data
    format as specified in ISO/IEC 19794-8:2006 (Type A Level 1 as defined in ISO/IEC
    29109-1:2009),test asssertions of internal consistency by checking the types of
    values that may be contained within each field (Type A Level 2 as defined in ISO/IEC
    29109-1:2009).It does not establishtest of conformance of Common Biometric Exchange
    Formats Framework (CBEFF) structures required by ISO/IEC 19794-8:2006,test of
    consistency with input biometric data record (Level 3),test of other characteristics
    of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance,
    performance, robustness, security),test of conformance of systems that do not
    produce ISO/IEC 19794-8:2006 records.
