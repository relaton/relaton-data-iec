  content: "Artificial intelligence (AI) is continuously making inroads into domains
    previously reserved to humans. Robots support workers in the manufacturing sector;
    digital assistants automate office tasks; intelligent appliances order food based
    on owners’ preferences or control lighting and temperature in the home in preparation
    of their arrival. Increasingly sophisticated algorithms have the potential to
    help address some of humanity’s biggest challenges. They also bring about a number
    of risks and threats that businesses, governments and policy makers need to understand
    and tackle carefully.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis white paper sets the scene for understanding
    where AI stands today and the outlook for the next 5 to 10 years. Taking an industrial
    perspective, it discusses in more detail: smart homes, intelligent manufacturing,
    smart transportation/self-driving vehicles, and the energy sector.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIt covers current technological capabilities and provides a detailed description
    of some of the major existing and future challenges related to safety, security,
    privacy, trust and ethics that AI will have to address at the international level.
    AI will become one of the core technologies across many different industries and
    standardization will play a critical role in shaping its future.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe white paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>)
    with major contributions from Haier Group and project partner the German Research
    Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI). Supporting project team members included
    SAP, Huawei, NSW Data Analytics Centre (DAC), China Electronic Standardization
    Institute (CESI), LG Electronics, and Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO).<br
