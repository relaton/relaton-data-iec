- content: "<p>Manufacturers of bar code equipment and users of bar code technology
    require publicly available standard symbology specifications to which they can
    refer when developing equipment and software.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15420:2009 specifies
    the requirements for the bar code symbology known as EAN/UPC. It specifies EAN/UPC
    symbology characteristics, data character encodation, dimensions, tolerances,
    decoding algorithms and parameters to be defined by applications. It specifies
    the Symbology Identifier prefix strings for EAN/UPC symbols.</p><p>Data content
    and the rules governing the use of this symbology are outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    15420:2009; they are defined in the GS1 General Specifications.</p>"
