    <p>This document is one of a series of International Standards describing the parameters for identification cards as defined in the terms and definitions clause and the use of such cards for international interchange.</p>
    <p>This document specifies requirements for embossed characters on identification cards. The embossed characters are intended for transfer of data either by use of imprinters or by visual or machine reading. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.</p>
    <p>It is the purpose of this document to provide criteria to which cards shall perform. No consideration is given within this document to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria is negotiated between the involved parties.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10373‑1 specifies the test procedures used to check cards against the parameters specified in this document.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1    Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial measurement system in this document may have been rounded off and are consistent with, but not exactly equal to each other. Using either system is correct but intermixing or reconverting values can result in errors. The original design was made using the Imperial measurement system.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2    Tactile Identifier Mark (TIM) defined by ISO/IEC 7811‑9 can be located in the name and address area of this document. The layout of embossed characters in this area is not intended to interfere with TIM.</p>
