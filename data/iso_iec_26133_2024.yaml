abstract:
- content: "<p>OpenID Connect 1.0 is a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0
    protocol. It enables Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the
    authentication performed by an Authorization Server, as well as to obtain basic
    profile information about the End-User in an interoperable and REST-like manner.</p><p>This
    document defines how an OpenID Connect Relying Party can dynamically register
    with the End-User's OpenID Provider, providing information about itself to the
    OpenID Provider, and obtaining information needed to use it, including the OAuth
    2.0 Client ID for this Relying Party.</p>"
