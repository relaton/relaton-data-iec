    <p>This document specifies provision of connectionless user data confidentiality, frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity by media access independent protocols and entities that operate transparently to MAC Clients.</p>
    <p>NOTE—The MAC Clients are as specified in IEEE Std 802®, IEEE Std 802.1Q?, and IEEE Std 802.1X.2</p>
    <p>To this end, it</p>
    <p>a) Specifies the requirements to be satisfied by equipment claiming conformance to this standard.</p>
    <p>b) Specifies the requirements for MACsec in terms of provision of the MAC Service and the</p>
    <p>preservation of the semantics and parameters of service requests and indications.</p>
    <p>c) Describes the threats, both intentional and accidental, to correct provision of the service.</p>
    <p>d) Specifies security services that prevent, or restrict, the effect of attacks that exploit these threats.</p>
    <p>e) Examines the potential impact of both the threats and the use of MACsec on the Quality of Service</p>
    <p>(QoS), specifying constraints on the design and operation of MAC Security entities and protocols.</p>
    <p>f) Models support of the secure MAC Service in terms of the operation of media access control method</p>
    <p>independent MAC Security Entities (SecYs) within the MAC Sublayer.</p>
    <p>g) Specifies the format of the MACsec Protocol Data Unit (MPDUs) used to provide secure service.</p>
    <p>h) Identifies the functions to be performed by each SecY, and provides an architectural model of its</p>
    <p>internal operation in terms of Processes and Entities that provide those functions.</p>
    <p>i) Specifies each SecY's use of an associated and collocated Port Access Entity (PAE,</p>
    <p>IEEE Std 802.1X) to discover and authenticate MACsec protocol peers and its use of that PAE's</p>
    <p>Key Agreement Entity (KaY) to agree and update cryptographic keys.</p>
    <p>j) Specifies performance requirements and recommends default values and applicable ranges for the</p>
    <p>operational parameters of a SecY.</p>
    <p>k) Specifies how SecYs are incorporated within the architecture of end stations, bridges, and two-port</p>
    <p>Ethernet Data Encryption devices (EDEs).</p>
    <p>l) Establishes the requirements for management of MAC Security, identifying the managed objects</p>
    <p>and defining the management operations for SecYs.</p>
    <p>m) Specifies the Management Information Base (MIB) module for managing the operation of MAC</p>
    <p>Security in TCP/IP networks.</p>
    <p>n) Specifies requirements, criteria, and choices of Cipher Suites for use with this standard.</p>
