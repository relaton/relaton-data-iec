abstract:
- content: "IEC 61009-1:2024 gives general requirements and tests for residual current
    operated circuit‑breakers with integral overcurrent protection for household and
    similar uses (hereafter referred to as RCBOs), for rated operational voltages
    not exceeding 440 V AC, with rated frequencies of 50 Hz, 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz and
    rated currents not exceeding 125 A and rated short‑circuit capacities not exceeding
    25 000 A.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2010, Amendment 1:2012 and Amendment 2:2013. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) harmonization
    of all clauses between the IEC 61008, IEC 61009 and IEC 60755 series using blocks
    and modules approach;<br />\r\nb) harmonization of all tables and figures between
    the IEC 61008, IEC 61009 and IEC 60755 series;<br />\r\nc) terms and definitions
    are now referred to IEC 62873-2;<br />\r\nd) modification of Subclause 4.1 for
    classification according to supply conditions;<br />\r\ne) new Subclauses 8.17
    and 9.24 for requirements and tests for the resistance to temporary overvoltages
    (TOV);<br />\r\nf) improvement of Subclause 9.7 for test of dielectric properties;<br
    />\r\ng) tests for screwless, flat-quick terminals and aluminium conductors are
    now referred to in the IEC 62873-3 series."
