abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15908:2014 provides the basis for metamodel definition in OMG's
    family of MDA languages and is based on a simplification of UML2's class modeling
    capabilities. In addition to providing the means for metamodel definition it adds
    core capabilities for model management in general, including Identifiers, a simple
    generic Tag capability and Reflective operations that are defined generically
    and can be applied regardless of metamodel.</p>"
