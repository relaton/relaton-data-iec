    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62442-3:2022
    defines measurement and calculation methods for specifying the efficiency and
    the standby power of controlgear for tungsten-halogen lamps and LED light sources.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2018.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    this edition has been harmonized with IEC 62442-1 and IEC 62442-­2;<br />\r\n-
    the reference to and use of the measurement methods for non-active power consumption
    in accordance with IEC 63103 have been added."
