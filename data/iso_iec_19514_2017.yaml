abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19514:2017 is to specify the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), a general-purpose
    modeling language for systems engineering. Its intent is to specify the language
    so that systems engineering modelers may learn to apply and use SysML; modeling
    tool vendors may implement and support SysML; and both can provide feedback to
    improve future versions. Note that a definition of \"system\" and \"systems engineering\"
    can be found in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.<br />\r\nSysML reuses a subset of UML 2 and
    provides additional extensions to satisfy the requirements of the language. This
    International Standard documents the language architecture in terms of the parts
    of UML 2 that are reused and the extensions to UML 2. The International Standard
    includes the concrete syntax (notation) for the complete language and specifies
    the extensions to UML 2. The reusable portion of the UML 2 standard is not included
    directly in the International Standard but is included by reference. The International
    Standard also provides examples of how the language can be used to solve common
    systems engineering problems.<br />\r\nSysML is designed to provide simple but
    powerful constructs for modeling a wide range of systems engineering problems.
    It is particularly effective in specifying requirements, structure, behavior,
    allocations, and constraints on system properties to support engineering analysis.
    The language is intended to support multiple processes and methods such as structured,
    object-oriented, and others, but each methodology may impose additional constraints
    on how a construct or diagram kind may be used. This version of the language supports
    most, but not all, of the requirements of the UML for Systems Engineering RFP,
    as shown in the Requirements Traceability referenced by Annex F. These gaps are
    intended to be addressed in future versions of SysML as indicated in the matrix.<br
    />\r\nThe following sub clauses provide background information about this International
    Standard. Instructions for both systems engineers and tool vendors who read this
    International Standard are provided in \"How to Read this International Standard.\"
    The main body of this International Standard describes the normative technical
    content. The annexes include additional information to aid in understanding and
    implementation of this International Standard."
