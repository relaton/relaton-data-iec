    29341-20-4:2017 defines the layout of the AV Datastructure Template (AVDT) XML
    document. An AVDT document describes the format requirements and restrictions
    of various data structures used within the UPnP AV specifications. Although these
    data structures are defined very precisely in the appropriate service specification,
    in most cases, each data structure definition allows for a certain degree of variation
    in order to accommodate differences between individual devices.<br />\r\nThe purpose
    of an AVDT document is to enable each device to describe (at run-time) its particular
    variation of these AV data structures. AVDT documents allow users of AV data structures
    (e.g. UPnP control points) to reduce the number of instances of those data structures
    that comply with the service specification but are not compatible with the device's
    particular capabilities. The ultimate goal of an AVDT document is to reduce those
    error conditions that are caused by control points creating instances of a data
    structure that exceed the static (known) capabilities of the device. Unfortunately,
    the AVDT mechanism will never eliminate all preventable error conditions, but
    it will help to reduce them by giving the client more information about the device's
    particular capabilities.<br />\r\nAs described above, an AVDT document is a machine
    readable, implementation-specific variant of an AV data structure defined by one
    of the UPnP AV specifications. For a given device, each instance of that data
    structure shall conform to both the specification definition and the device's
    AVDT definition of that data structure.<br />\r\nIronically, an AVDT document
    is both a more-restrictive and more-permissive variant of the specification definition.
    AVDT documents are more restrictive because they limit certain aspects of the
    data structure (e.g. such as the allowed values for each field) that are otherwise
    permitted by the specification definition. However, due to limitations of the
    AVDT constructs, it is simply not possible to express some of the more intricate
    requirements defined by the specification (e.g. subtle interdependencies between
    data structure fields). Consequently, instances of a data structure that comply
    with a given AVDT description may not fully comply with all of the requirements
    defined in the specification.<br />\r\nThe types of data structures that can be
    described by an AVDT document represent a (non-hierarchitical) set of named property
    values. The set of allowed property names and their allowed values for a given
    data structure are defined by one of the UPnP AV specifications. Individual instances
    of these data structures are manifested via an XML document whose elements and
    attributes correspond to the set of named properties. In other words, within the
    XML document that corresponds to a given instance of a certain data structure,
    each XML element and attribute contains the value of a specific named property.<br
    />\r\nAn AVDT document is conceptually similar to an XML schema in that both entities
    identify the XML elements and attributes that appear in any given document instance.
    Additionally, both AVDT documents and XML schemas identify the allowed values
    that are permitted for each element and/or attribute which corresponds to a specific
    property. However, unlike an XML schema, an AVDT document can also identify certain
    dependencies between two or more properties. For example, the set of allowed values
    of one property may depend on the actual value of another property. This type
    of interrelationship is difficult to represent using an XML schema. Hence, the
    AVDTdocument structure is needed.<br />\r\nIn the various AV Architecture scenarios,
    sometimes there is a need to exchange device capabilities to ensure high level
    interoperability. In order to express the parameterized capability, an AV specification
    defines various templates for each purpose. A device uses the template and populates
    it with values to reflect its capabilities at run-time.<br />\r\nThe AV Datastructure
    Template (AVDT) is a common structure to define various templates, which are called
    \"Datastructure\". This is written in XML and each data structure uses a subset
    of the AVDT to meet the necessary requirement."
