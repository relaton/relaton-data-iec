    <p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge to</p>
    <p>enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the</p>
    <p>recording method and the recorded format called MammothTape-2, and thereby allowing data interchange between drives by</p>
    <p>means of such magnetic tape cartridges.</p>
    <p>Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the</p>
    <p>interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p>
