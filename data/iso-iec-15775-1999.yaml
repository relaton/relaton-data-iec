    <p>This International Standard applies to implementation and application of test charts for colour copying machines.</p>
    <p>This International Standard serves for testing of reproduction properties of colour copying machines, in order to help</p>
    <p>to recognize the possibilities and limits of various machines and for their comparison.</p>
    <p>To use this International Standard, make copies of at least two test charts (one achromatic and one chromatic) out of</p>
    <p>eight test charts using the device to be tested. The resulting copies shall be examined visually and may be</p>
    <p>compared with the original test charts. Objective measurements may be made for these copies.</p>
    <p>Eight ISO-test charts, four in halftone (offset reproduction) and four in continuous tone (photographic reproduction),</p>
    <p>belonging to this International Standard may be produced by different manufacturers. Information about where to</p>
    <p>obtain test chart layout and colorimetric L*a*b* data to produce the charts may be found in Annex M.</p>
    <p>All hard copy patterns (analog test charts) produced according to this International Standard should be discarded</p>
    <p>after three years.</p>
