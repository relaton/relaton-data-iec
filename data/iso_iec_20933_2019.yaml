abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20933:2019 This document specifies a framework for a distributed real-time Access
    system. It includes:<br />\r\n1) an ID triggered modular system architecture,
    the functions of the modules, the semantics of messages those modules exchange,
    and elements of messages;<br />\r\n2) the system behaviour from the time it receives
    an access request until the time it sends the result along with the sequence;<br
    />\r\n3) performance measurement mechanisms using a time stamping function that
    can be employed for the evaluation of the system."
