abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a framework for a distributed real-time Access
    system. It includes:</p><p>1) an ID triggered modular system architecture, the
    functions of the modules, the semantics of messages those modules exchange, and
    elements of messages;</p><p>2) the system behaviour from the time it receives
    an access request until the time it sends the result along with the sequence;</p><p>3)
    performance measurement mechanisms using a time stamping function that can be
    employed for the evaluation of the system.</p>"
