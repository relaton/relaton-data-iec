    <p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-4:2015 provides an overview to the structure and terminology of the Linux/UNIX graphical environments accessibility API.</p>
    <p>It will provide the following:</p>
    <p>-      a description of the overall architecture and terminology of the API;</p>
    <p>-      further introductory explanations regarding the content and use of the API beyond those found in ISO/IEC 13066‑1:2011, Annex A;</p>
    <p>-      an overview of the main properties, including</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      of user interface elements,</li>
    <li>-      of how to get and set focus, and</li>
    <li>-      of communication mechanisms in the API;</li>
    </ul>
    <p>-      a discussion of design considerations for the API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility guidance related to using the API);</p>
    <p>-      information on extending the API (and where this is appropriate);</p>
    <p>-      an introduction to the programming interface of the API (including pointers to external sources of information).</p>
    <p>It will provide this information as an introduction to the Java API to assist the following:</p>
    <p>-      IT system level developers who create custom controls and/or interface to them;</p>
    <p>-      AT developers involved in programming "hardware to software" and "software to software" interactions.</p>
