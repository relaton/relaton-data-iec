abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a set of JavaScript Object Notation Encoding Rules
    (JER) that may be used to derive a transfer syntax for values of types defined
    in Rec. ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1, Rec. ITU-T X.681 | ISO/IEC 8824-2, Rec.
    ITU-T X.682 | ISO/IEC 8824-3 and Rec. ITU-T X.683 | ISO/IEC 8824-4. It is implicit
    in the specification of these encoding rules that they are also to be used for
    decoding.<br />\r\nThe encoding rules specified in this document:<br />\r\n– are
    used at the time of communication;<br />\r\n– are intended for use in circumstances
    where interoperability with applications using JSON is the major concern in the
    choice of encoding rules;<br />\r\n– allow the extension of an abstract syntax
    by addition of extra values for all forms of extensibility described in Rec. ITU-T
    X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824‑1.<br />\r\nThis document also specifies the syntax and semantics
    of JER encoding instructions, as well as the rules for their assignment and combination.
    JER encoding instructions can be used to control JER encoding for specific Abstract
    Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) types."
