abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60825-19:2024 specifies the velocity-dependent closest points of
    human access (VCPHA) for the classification of moving platform laser products
    when considering the movement of the platform with respect to a stationary frame
    of reference. This presupposes that the inherent kinetic hazard of the moving
    platform creates a zone in which persons would not be reasonably expected to be
    located. Additionally, it takes neighbouring moving platforms into account by
    defining stationary and moving apertures. This document is applicable to all laser
    products whose laser apertures are on a moving platform.<br />\r\nLaser products
    are sometimes used on moving platforms. Currently the standard IEC 60825-1:2014
    considers only a stationary aperture; it does not address the situations where
    the emitting aperture is mounted on a platform, such as a vehicle, that can be
    in motion. Failure to consider the effects of the motion of the platform can result
    in overly restrictive assessment of the hazard.<br />\r\nAlthough accounting for
    a platform’s movement during the assessment of a laser product’s classification
    can lead to less restrictive measurement conditions, it is important not to overlook
    that there can be apertures, even on other moving platforms, moving at a relative
    speed of zero or close to zero with respect to the moving platform laser product
    being classified."
