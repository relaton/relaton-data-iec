    <p>This document specifies elements of conformance testing methodology, test assertions, and test procedures as applicable to two-dimensional face images defined in the ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 biometric data interchange format standard for face image data.</p>
    <p>This document establishes</p>
    <p>—          test assertions of the structure of the face image data format as specified in ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005 (Type A Level 1 as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009),</p>
    <p>—          test assertions of internal consistency by checking the types of values that may be contained within each field (Type A Level 2 as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009).</p>
    <p>This document does not establish</p>
    <p>—          tests of conformance of 3D face records defined in ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005, 5.7.1, codes 0x80, 0x81, and 0x82,</p>
    <p>—          tests of conformance of CBEFF structures required by ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005,</p>
    <p>—          tests of consistency with the input biometric data record (Level 3),</p>
    <p>—          tests of conformance of the image data to the quality-related specifications of ISO/IEC 19794-5:2005,</p>
    <p>—          tests of conformance of the image data blocks to the respective JPEG or JPEG 2000 standards,</p>
    <p>—          tests of other characteristics of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g., acceptance, performance, robustness, security).</p>
