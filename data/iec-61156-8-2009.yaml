  content: IEC 61156-8:2009(E) relates to IEC 61156-1 and IEC 61156-7. The cables
    described herein are specified up to 1 200 MHz and are specifically designed to
    build patch, equipment, and work area cables as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and ISO/IEC
    15018. It covers a cable having four individually screened (STP) pairs. The cable
    may be provided with a common screen over the cable core. The transmission characteristics
    are specified for a frequency range 4 MHz to 1 200 MHz and at 20 °C. The contents
    of the corrigendum of July 2009 have been included in this copy.
