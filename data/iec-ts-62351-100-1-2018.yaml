  content: "IEC TS 62351-100-1:2018(E), which is a technical specification, describes
    test cases of data and communication security for telecontrol equipment, substation
    automation systems (SAS) and telecontrol systems, including front-end functions
    of SCADA.<br />\r\nThe goal of this document is to enable interoperability by
    providing a standard method of testing protocol implementations to verify that
    a device fulfils the requirement of the standard. Note that conformity to the
    standard does not guarantee interoperability between devices using different implementations.
    It is expected that using this specification during testing will minimize the
    risk of non-interoperability. A basic condition for this interoperability is a
    passed conformance test of both devices.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document is
    to specify commonly available procedures and definitions for conformance and/or
    interoperability testing of IEC TS 62351-5 and IEC TS 60870-5-7. The conformance
    test cases defined herein are focused to verify the conformant integration of
    the underlying authentication, as specified in IEC TS 62351-5 and IEC TS 60870-5-7,
    to protect IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 6870-5-104-based communications.<br />\r\nThis
    document deals with data and communication security conformance testing; therefore,
    other requirements, such as safety or EMC, are not covered. These requirements
    are covered by other standards (if applicable) and the proof of compliance for
    these topics is done according to these standards."
