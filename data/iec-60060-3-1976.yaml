abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Applies to devices and complete systems, other than sphere-gaps, used for
    the measurement of voltages and currents during dielectric tests with direct voltage,
    alternating voltage, lightning and switching impulse voltages and for tests with
    high-impulse currents. Voltage measurements with sphere-gaps are dealt with in
    IEC 52. Gives guidance concerning the quantities to be measured, accuracies required
    and requirements of measuring systems.
