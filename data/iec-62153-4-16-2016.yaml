  script: Latn
  content: IEC 62153-4-16:2016(E) describes a method to extrapolate the test results
    of transfer impedance to higher frequencies and the test results of screening
    attenuation to lower frequencies when measured with the triaxial set-up according
    to IEC 62153-4-3 (method B) respectively IEC 62153-4-4. A similar approach to
    extrapolate the test results of transfer impedance to higher frequencies was already
    described in IEC 61196-1:1995 Subclause 12.2. This method is applicable for homogenous
    screens, i.e. screens having a transfer impedance directly proportional to length.
    The transfer impedance may have any frequency behaviour, i.e. it could have a
    behaviour where it does not increase with 20 dB per decade as observed for screens
    made of a foil and a braid.
