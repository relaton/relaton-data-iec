abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62635:2012(E) provides a methodology for information exchange involving
    EEE manufacturers and recyclers, and for calculating the recyclability and recoverability
    rates to provide information to recyclers to enable appropriate and optimized
    EoL treatment operations, provide sufficient information to characterize activities
    at EoL treatment facilities in order to enable manufacturers to implement effective
    ECD, evaluate the recyclability and recoverability rates based on product attributes
    and reflecting real end-of-life practices.
