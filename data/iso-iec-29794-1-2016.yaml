    <p>ISO/IEC 29794-1:2016, for any or all biometric sample types as necessary, establishes the following:</p>
    <p>-      terms and definitions that are useful in the specification and use of quality metrics;</p>
    <p>-      purpose and interpretation of biometric quality scores;</p>
    <p>-      encoding of quality data fields in biometric data interchange formats;</p>
    <p>-      methods for developing biometric sample datasets for the purpose of quality score normalisation;</p>
    <p>-      format for exchange of quality algorithm results;</p>
    <p>-      methods for aggregation of quality scores.</p>
    <p>The following are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 29794-1:2016:</p>
    <p>-      specification of minimum requirements for sample, module, or system quality scores;</p>
