abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62565-4-1:2019 establishes a blank detail specification and format
    for listing essential optical and certain other characteristics of monodisperse
    luminescent nanomaterials. This document does not address mixtures or agglomerations
    of luminescent nanomaterials.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document enables the
    customer to specify requirements in a standardized manner and to verify through
    standardized methods that the luminescent nanomaterial meets the required properties.<br
    />\r\nNumeric values to be specified for the properties and characteristics in
    this document are intentionally left blank and are determined by agreement between
    customer and material supplier. Properties and characteristics deemed by the customer
    or supplier as not relevant to a specific application are classified as “not applicable”
    or “not specified”."
