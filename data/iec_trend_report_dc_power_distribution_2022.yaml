abstract:
- content: "The need to accelerate the adoption of renewable energies, the exponential
    growth of power consumption for data and the Internet of Things (IoT), and the
    fast growth of electric vehicles (EVs) are pushing the transmission and distribution
    grid to evolve. A greater reliance on direct current (DC) is one of the options.<br
    /><br />\r\nThe aim of this report is to specify a common vision concerning the
    next steps needed to maximize the evolution of DC in a unique direction that would
    be beneficial for the energy ecosystem and for all involved parties.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology trend report was developed by the DC Power
    Distribution Sub-Working Group (DCPD-SWG) of the Societal and Technology Trend
    Working Group (STTWG) in the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB).<br /><br />\r\nThis
    IEC STTR is available for free download."
