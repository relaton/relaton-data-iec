    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document describes potential applications of biometrics in identity management systems used for medical and healthcare purposes. It provides feedback from healthcare practitioners on the advantages, disadvantages, risks and priority of implementing certain use cases of healthcare with biometrics. For those use cases, information related to the selection of biometric type and associated measures related to security and privacy protection is provided to system designers.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The document concentrates on aspects of the subject which apply to the good management of healthcare services for patients who need monitoring, treatment and care in hospitals, clinics or at home, but can be incapacitated. It does not cover the measurement and interpretation of symptoms and biological data for the purposes of medical treatment or research.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The document is intended to be useful for the management of public and private healthcare systems anywhere in the world, and to commercial providers of identity management services and equipment. It is also potentially relevant to regulatory stakeholders addressing issues of privacy and legality, and the assessment of potential vulnerabilities in biometrics and identity management systems applied in the healthcare sector.</span></p>
