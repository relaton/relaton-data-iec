abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 29155-4:2016 provides general requirements and guidance for
    collecting and maintaining data of information technology (IT) projects and for
    delivering the benchmarking repository within benchmarking activities of "the
    IT project performance benchmarking framework" by prescribing the following:</p><p>a)
    requirements and guidance for data element definitions;</p><p>b) requirements
    and guidance for the data collection and maintenance processes within the benchmarking
    framework;</p><p>c) requirements and guidance for maintaining benchmarking repository
    product and issued benchmarks.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29155-4:2016 mainly focuses on three
    major activities, which are "maintain repository", "submit IT project data", and
    "measure IT project" activities.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29155-4:2016 is intended for use
    by stakeholder(s) of IT project performance benchmarking (e.g. benchmarking user,
    benchmark provider, benchmarking service provider, and IT project team).</p><p>NOTE
    The following are examples of how this document can be used:</p><p>- by a benchmark
    provider, to define data elements, collect and maintain IT project data, and provide
    benchmarking repository product or issued benchmarks;</p><p>- by a benchmarking
    analyst, to use benchmarking repository product and/or benchmarks for executing
    an instance of benchmarking;</p><p>- by a benchmarking service provider, to utilize
    benchmarking repository product and/or benchmarks for providing benchmarking services;</p><p>-
    by an IT service provider, to define data elements to be measured and/or to be
    submitted to repository owner.</p><p>It is out of the scope of this document to
    prescribe a particular set of data element definitions, formats or contents of
    the benchmarking repository.</p>
