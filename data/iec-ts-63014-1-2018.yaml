  content: IEC TS 63014-1:2018(E) is intended to provide an overall and consistent
    set of guidelines to facilitate the specification of equipment for the DC-side
    of a high-voltage direct current (HVDC) system using line-commutated converters.
    For point-to-point HVDC transmission systems, this document covers all DC-side
    equipment located between the converter valves and the DC overhead line or cable
    termination, excluding the converter valves themselves. For back-to-back HVDC
    systems, this document covers all DC-side equipment excluding the converter valves
    themselves.
