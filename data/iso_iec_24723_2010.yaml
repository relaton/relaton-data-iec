abstract:
- content: Composite symbologies are a class of bar code symbology, the principal
    distinguishing feature of which is that they comprise two, or more, components,
    each of which is a distinct symbol, but which contain a set of related data. Typically
    one component is a linear symbol containing primary data, which can be read on
    its own in some areas of the application. The other component(s) is a two-dimensional
    symbol containing supplementary data which qualifies the primary message, and
    requiring all components to be read to extract the complete message. The GS1 Composite
    symbology is one such symbology. The use of the symbology is intended to comply
    with the GS1 General Specifications.A GS1 Composite symbol consists of a linear
    component (encoding the item's primary identification) associated with an adjacent
    2D component (encoding supplementary data, such as a batch number or expiration
    date). The GS1 Composite symbol always includes a linear component so that the
    primary identification is readable by all scanning technologies, and so that 2D
    imagers can use the linear component as a finder pattern for the adjacent 2D component.
    The GS1 Composite symbol always includes a multi-row 2D component, for compatibility
    with linear and 2D imagers, and with linear and rastering laser scanners.GS1 Composite
    symbols are intended for encoding identification numbers and data supplementary
    to the identification in accordance with the GS1 General Specifications. The administration
    of the numbering system by GS1 ensures that identification codes assigned to particular
    items are unique world-wide and that they and the associated supplementary data
    are defined in a consistent way.ISO/IEC 24723:2010 defines the requirements for
    the GS1 Composite symbology. It specifies the GS1 Composite symbology characteristics,
    data character encodation, symbol formats, dimensions and print quality requirements,
    error correction rules, and reference decoding algorithms. For those linear and
    2D components of GS1 Composite symbols with published symbology specifications,
    those published specifications apply, except as specifically noted in ISO/IEC
    24723:2010.
