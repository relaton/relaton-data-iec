  content: "IEC 63093-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 63093-2:2025
    specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical interchangeability
    for a preferred range of pot-cores made of ferrite, and the dimensional limits
    for coil formers to be used with them, as well as the effective parameter values
    to be used in calculations involving them. It also gives guidelines on the allowable
    limits of surface irregularities applicable to pot-cores in accordance with the
    relevant generic specification. The selection of core sizes and shapes for this
    document is based on the philosophy of including those sizes which are industrial
    standards, either by inclusion in a national standard, or by broad-based use in
    industry. The general considerations upon which the design of this range of cores
    is based are given in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of
    Table 4 and Table 5 according to IEC 60205:2016."
