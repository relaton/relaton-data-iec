  content: "IEC TS 61857-42:2025 provides a procedure to evaluate the lifetime of
    an electrical insulation system (EIS) in a drivetrain unit within road transportation
    (automotive) applications. Typical applications include motors and generators
    in hybrid and full electric passenger vehicles, light-duty and heavy-duty commercial
    vehicles, as well as buses.<br />\r\nIn general, the IEC 61857 series is applicable
    to EIS used in electrotechnical products with an input voltage of up to 1 000
    V where the predominant ageing factor is thermal. In the context of this document
    the limit of 1 000 V is understood to be the application-specific battery DC voltage.<br
    />\r\nThe EIS evaluated by this procedure will operate free from partial discharges
    over its whole lifetime.<br />\r\nEvaluation of EIS in the following applications
    is outside the scope:<br />\r\n- motors and generators within the scope of IEC
    TC 2, Rotating machinery;<br />\r\n- rail traction machines in the scope of IEC
    TC 9, Electrical equipment and systems for railways;<br />\r\n- motors and generators
    for road vehicles that are not intended for the traction of them."
