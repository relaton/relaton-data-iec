  content: IEC TS 62804-1:2015(E) defines procedures to test and evaluate the durability
    of crystalline silicon photovoltaic (PV) modules to the effects of short-term
    high-voltage stress including potential-induced degradation (PID). Two test methods
    are defined that do not inherently produce equivalent results. They are given
    as screening tests; neither test includes all the factors existing in the natural
    environment that can affect the PID rate. The methods describe how to achieve
    a constant stress level. The testing in this Technical Specification is designed
    for crystalline silicon PV modules with one or two glass surfaces, silicon cells
    having passivating dielectric layers, for degradation mechanisms involving mobile
    ions influencing the electric field over the silicon semiconductor, or electronically
    interacting with the silicon semiconductor itself.
