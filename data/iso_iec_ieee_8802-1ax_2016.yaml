abstract:
- content: Link Aggregation provides protocols, procedures, and managed objects that
    allow the following:<p>- One or more parallel instances of full-duplex point-to-point
    links to be aggregated together to form a Link Aggregation Group (LAG), such that
    a MAC Client can treat the LAG as if it were a single link.</p><p>- A resilient
    interconnect using multiple full-duplex point-to-point links among one to three
    nodes in a network and one to three nodes in another, separately administered,
    network, along with a means to ensure that frames belonging to any given service
    will use the same physical path in both directions between the two networks.</p><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE
    8802-1AX:2015 defines the MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability and general
    information relevant to specific MAC types that support Link Aggregation. The
    capabilities defined are compatible with previous versions of this standard.</p>
