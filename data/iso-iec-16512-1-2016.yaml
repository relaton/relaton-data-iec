    <p>Relayed multicast protocol (RMCP) is a protocol which is used to realize a relayed multicast data transport scheme. Different from the conventional IP multicast, RMCP can configure a relayed multicast path that multicast traffic flows by using intermediate end-hosts. RMCP can be applied to the current unicast based IP network where IP multicast is not fully deployed. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 16512-1:2016 addresses the basic concepts needed to specify RMCP for relayed multicast. It defines the related terminology and proposes a framework for the future development of subsequent protocols. The framework covers network topology including network entities and the relationship among them, service scenarios, basic operations, and message format.</p>
