    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-6-16:2008(E) describes the service type which enables the means to set and get a temperature setpoint for use by a temperature controller. The series of ISO/IEC 29341 publications defines an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity of intelligent appliances, wireless devices and PCs. It is designed to bring easy to use, flexible, standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home, in a small business, public spaces or attached to the Internet.</p>
