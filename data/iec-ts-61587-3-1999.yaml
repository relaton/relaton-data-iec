  content: Specifies the test of empty cabinets and subracks concerning electromagnetic
    shielding performance, in the frequency range of 30 MHz to 1 000 MHz. Stipulated
    attenuation values are chosen for the definition of the shielding performance
    level of cabinets and subracks as per the IEC 60297 and IEC 60917 series. The
    purpose is to ensure physical integrity and environmental performance in cabinets
    and subracks.
