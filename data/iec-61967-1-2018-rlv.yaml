  content: "IEC 61967-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 61967-1:2018
    provides general information and definitions on the measurement of conducted and
    radiated electromagnetic disturbances from integrated circuits. It also provides
    a description of measurement conditions, test equipment and set-up as well as
    the test procedures and content of the test reports. Test method comparison tables
    are include in Annex A to assist in selecting the appropriate measurement method(s).
    The object of this document is to describe general conditions in order to establish
    a uniform testing environment and to obtain a quantitative measure of RF disturbances
    from integrated circuits (IC). Critical parameters that are expected to influence
    the test results are described. Deviations from this document are noted explicitly
    in the individual test report. The measurement results can be used for comparison
    or other purposes. Measurement of the voltage and current of conducted RF emissions
    or radiated RF disturbances, coming from an integrated circuit under controlled
    conditions, yields information about the potential for RF disturbances in an application
    of the integrated circuit. The applicable frequency range is described in each
    part of IEC 61967.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the frequency range of
    150 kHz to 1 GHz has been deleted from the title;<br />\r\n- the frequency step
    above 1 GHz has been added to Table 1, Table 2 and to 5.4;<br />\r\n- Table A.1
    has been divided into two tables, and IEC 61967-8 has been added to Table A.2
    of Annex A;<br />\r\n- the general test board description has been moved to Annex
    D.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
