abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19795-2:2007 addresses two specific biometric performance testing
    methodologies: technology and scenario evaluation. The large majority of biometric
    tests are of one of these two generic evaluation types. Technology evaluations
    evaluate enrolment and comparison algorithms by means of previously collected
    corpuses, while scenario evaluations evaluate sensors and algorithms by processing
    of samples collected from Test Subjects in real time. The former is intended for
    generation of large volumes of comparison scores and candidate lists indicative
    of the fundamental discriminating power of an algorithm. The latter is intended
    for measurement of performance in modeled environments, inclusive of Test Subject-system
    interactions.ISO/IEC 19795-2:2007 provides requirements and recommendations on
    data collection, analysis and reporting specific to the two primary types of evaluation:
    technology evaluation and scenario evaluation.It specifies requirements in the
    following areas:development and full description of protocols for technology and
    scenario evaluations;execution and reporting of biometric evaluations reflective
    of the parameters associated with biometric evaluation types.'
