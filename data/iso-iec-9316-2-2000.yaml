  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />SCSI provides a diverse range of peripherals
    for attachment to a wide range of computing equipment. Some system manufacturers
    have developed approaches for SCSI attachment which are widely followed, increasing
    the applications available for the attachment of SCSI peripherals. In markets
    where no standard method of attachment exists, however, variations between third
    party sellers have made it nearly impossible for end users to attach more than
    one SCSI peripheral to one host bus adapter. In an effort to broaden the application
    base for SCSI peripherals, an ad hoc industry group of companies representing
    system integrators, controllers, peripherals, and semiconductors decided to address
    the issues involved. That effort has evolved into this International Standard.
    Its purpose is to define a method whereby multiple environments may adopt a common
    procedure for the support of SCSI devices. The CAM provides a structured method
    for supporting peripherals with the software (e.g. device driver) and hardware
    (e.g. host bus adapter) associated with any computer.
