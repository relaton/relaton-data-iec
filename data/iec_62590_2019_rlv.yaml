abstract:
- content: "IEC 62590:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62590:2019 specifies the
    requirements for the performance of all fixed installations electronic power converters,
    using controllable and/or non-controllable electronic valves, intended for traction
    power supply. The devices can be controlled by means of current, voltage or light.
    Non-bistable devices are assumed to be operated in the switched mode.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to fixed installations of the following electric traction systems:<br
    />\r\n- railways,<br />\r\n- guided mass transport systems such as: tramways,
    light rail systems, elevated and underground railways, mountain railways, trolleybuses.<br
    />\r\nThis standard is based on EN 50328. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2010. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Incorporation
    of DC converters.<br />\r\nb) Correction of the clearances and withstand voltages
    due to erroneous use of PD in former edition.<br />\r\nc) adaption of structure,
    adaption of vocabulary, removal of unused term and abbreviations.</p>"
