abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14846:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Call Intrusion supplementary service (SS-CI) at the Q reference point between
    Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within
    a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>SS-CI is a supplementary service
    which, on request from the calling user, enables the calling user to establish
    communication with a busy called user by breaking into an established call between
    the called user and a third user (unwanted user).</p><p>The Q reference point
    is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three
    stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International
    Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    14845.</p><p>The signalling protocol for SS-CI operates on top of the signalling
    protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572,
    and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary
    services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14846:2003 also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between SS-CI and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>NOTE Additional
    interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference
    point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14846:2003
    is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
