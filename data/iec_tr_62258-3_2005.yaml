    This technical report has been developed to facilitate the production, supply and use of semiconductor die products, including:
    - singulated bare die,
    - minimally or partially encapsulated die and wafers.

    This report contains suggested good practice for the handling, packing and storage of die products.

    Success in manufacture of electronic assemblies containing die products is enhanced by attention to handling, storage and environmental conditions. This report provides guidelines taken from industry experience and is especially useful to those integrating die products into assemblies for the first time. It is also intended as an aid to setting up and auditing facilities that handle or use bare die products, from wafer fabrication to final assembly.
