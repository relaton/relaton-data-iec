  content: "ISO/IEC 15045-3-1:2024 describes the series of privacy, security, and
    safety standards to support the HES Gateway and attached devices. The purpose
    is to specify methods for protecting home and building systems from both internal
    and external threats, intrusions, or unintended observation of data and unsafe
    conditions that could result from network functions. Part 3 defines a set of basic
    and advanced requirements for gateway monitoring and control of both inbound and
    outbound traffic, including switching/routing, addressing, encryption, intrusion
    detection and prevention, and other “firewall” functions.<br />\r\nThe Part 3
    requirements specify the following functions:<br />\r\n1) prevention of active
    inbound attacks and unsafe commands,<br />\r\n2) discovery and classification
    of outbound traffic,<br />\r\n3) interoperability of premises internal network
    traffic,<br />\r\n4) management of privacy and security mechanisms, and<br />\r\n5)
    provision for a management and reporting dashboard for use by the non-technical
    end-user.<br />\r\nThis standard describes the inter-relationships between privacy,
    security, and safety."
