abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a family of logic languages designed for use
    in the representation and interchange of information and data among disparate
    computer systems.</p><p>The following features are essential to the design of
    this document.</p><p>— Languages in the family have declarative semantics. It
    is possible to understand the meaning of expressions in these languages without
    appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions.</p><p>— Languages
    in the family are logically comprehensive? at its most general, they provide for
    the expression of arbitrary first-order logical sentences.</p><p>— Languages in
    the family are translatable by a semantics-preserving transformation to a common
    XML-based syntax, facilitating interchange of information among heterogeneous
    computer systems.</p><p>The following are within the scope of this document:</p><p>—
    representation of information in ontologies and knowledge bases;</p><p>— specification
    of expressions that are the input or output of inference engines;</p><p>— formal
    interpretations of the symbols in the language.</p><p>The following are outside
    the scope of this document:</p><p>— specification of proof theory or inference
    rules;</p><p>— specification of translators between the notations of heterogeneous
    computer systems;</p><p>— computer-based operational methods of providing relationships
    between symbols in the logical "universe of discourse" and individuals in the
    "real world".</p><p>This document describes Common Logic's syntax and semantics.</p><p>This
    document defines an abstract syntax and an associated model-theoretic semantics
    for a specific extension of first-order logic. The intent is that the content
    of any system using first-order logic can be represented in this document. The
    purpose is to facilitate interchange of first-order logic-based information between
    systems.</p><p>Issues relating to computability using this document (including
    efficiency, optimization, etc.) are not addressed.</p>
