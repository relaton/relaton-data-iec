abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    24707:2018 This document specifies a family of logic languages designed for use
    in the representation and interchange of information and data among disparate
    computer systems.<br />\r\nThe following features are essential to the design
    of this document.<br />\r\n— Languages in the family have declarative semantics.
    It is possible to understand the meaning of expressions in these languages without
    appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions.<br />\r\n— Languages
    in the family are logically comprehensive? at its most general, they provide for
    the expression of arbitrary first-order logical sentences.<br />\r\n— Languages
    in the family are translatable by a semantics-preserving transformation to a common
    XML-based syntax, facilitating interchange of information among heterogeneous
    computer systems.<br />\r\nThe following are within the scope of this document:<br
    />\r\n— representation of information in ontologies and knowledge bases;<br />\r\n—
    specification of expressions that are the input or output of inference engines;<br
    />\r\n— formal interpretations of the symbols in the language.<br />\r\nThe following
    are outside the scope of this document:<br />\r\n— specification of proof theory
    or inference rules;<br />\r\n— specification of translators between the notations
    of heterogeneous computer systems;<br />\r\n— computer-based operational methods
    of providing relationships between symbols in the logical \"universe of discourse\"
    and individuals in the \"real world\".<br />\r\nThis document describes Common
    Logic's syntax and semantics.<br />\r\nThis document defines an abstract syntax
    and an associated model-theoretic semantics for a specific extension of first-order
    logic. The intent is that the content of any system using first-order logic can
    be represented in this document. The purpose is to facilitate interchange of first-order
    logic-based information between systems.<br />\r\nIssues relating to computability
    using this document (including efficiency, optimization, etc.) are not addressed."
