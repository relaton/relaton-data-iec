  content: "IEC TS 63331:2024 applies to electric dishwashers for household and similar
    use that are supplied with hot and/or cold water.<br />\r\nThis document deals
    with measurement procedures regarding the reduction of microbial contamination
    resulting from the use of electric dishwashers for household and similar use.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies methods that enable reproducible measurements. These
    derived measurement results can only be used for a relative statement. Absolute
    statements, i.e. health-related claims or conclusions about prevention or treatment
    of a disease or health improvement, are reserved for explicit regulatory action
    after a medical assessment.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to appliances
    intended to be used in medical, veterinary, or pharmaceutical applications.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not address sanitization, disinfection or sterilization
    measures.<br />\r\nThe dishwashing process is a complex operation consisting of
    cleaning dish items and cleaning the dishwasher itself. This document only focusses
    on the dish items to be cleaned."
