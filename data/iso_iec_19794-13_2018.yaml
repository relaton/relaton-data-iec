abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19794-13:2018 specifies a data interchange format that can be
    used for storing, recording, and transmitting digitized acoustic human voice data
    (speech) assumed to be from a single speaker recorded in a single session. This
    format is designed specifically to support a wide variety of Speaker Identification
    and Verification (SIV) applications, both text-dependent and text-independent,
    with minimal assumptions made regarding the voice data capture conditions or the
    collection environment. Other uses for the data encapsulated in this format, such
    as automated speech recognition (ASR), may be possible, but are not addressed
    in this documnet. This document also does not address handling of data that has
    been processed to the feature or voice model levels. No application-specific requirements,
    equipment, or features are addressed in this document. This document supports
    the optional inclusion of non-standardized extended data. This document allows
    both the original data captured and digitally-processed (enhanced) voice data
    to be exchanged. A description of any processing of the original source input
    is intended to be included in the metadata associated with the voice representations
    (VRs). This document does not address data streaming.<br />\r\nProvisions that
    stored and transmitted biometric data be time-stamped and that cryptographic techniques
    be used to protect their authenticity, integrity and confidentiality are out of
    the scope of this document.<br />\r\nInformation formatted in accordance with
    this document can be recorded on machine-readable media or can be transmitted
    by data communication between systems.<br />\r\nA general content-oriented subclause
    describing the voice data interchange format is followed by a subclause addressing
    an XML schema definition.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19794-13:2018 includes vocabulary in
    common use by the speech and speaker recognition community, as well as terminology
    from other ISO standards."
