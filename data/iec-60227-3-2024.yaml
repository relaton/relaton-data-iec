  content: IEC 60227-3:2024 details the particular standards for polyvinyl chloride
    insulated single-core non-sheathed cables for fixed wiring of rated voltages up
    to and including 450/750 V. This document provides the particular requirements
    for non-sheathed cables for fixed wiring which apply in addition to the appropriate
    requirements specified in IEC 60227-1, which apply to all cables. The tests for
    cables specified in the IEC 60227 series are described in IEC 63294.
