abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008 addresses some of the security requirements in the
    areas of authentication and other security services through the provision of a
    set of frameworks upon which full services can be based.Specifically, it defines
    frameworks for:Public-key certificates;Attribute certificates;Authentication services.The
    public-key certificate framework defined in ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008 includes definition
    of the information objects for Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), including public-key
    certificates, and Certificate Revocation List (CRL). The attribute certificate
    framework includes definition of the information objects for Privilege Management
    Infrastructure (PMI), including attribute certificates, and Attribute Certificate
    Revocation List (ACRL). ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008 also provides the framework for issuing,
    managing, using and revoking certificates. An extensibility mechanism is included
    in the defined formats for both certificate types and for all revocation list
    schemes. ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008 also includes a set of standard extensions for each,
    which is expected to be generally useful across a number of applications of PKI
    and PMI. The schema components (including object classes, attribute types and
    matching rules) for storing PKI and PMI objects in the Directory are included
    in ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008. Other elements of PKI and PMI, beyond these frameworks,
    such as key and certificate management protocols, operational protocols, additional
    certificate and CRL extensions, are expected to be defined by other standards
    bodies (e.g. ISO/TC 68 and IETF).The authentication scheme defined in ISO/IEC
    9594-8:2008 is generic and can be applied to a variety of applications and environments.The
    Directory makes use of public-key certificates and attribute certificates, and
    the framework for the Directory''s use of these facilities is also defined in
    ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008. Public-key technology, including certificates, is used by
    the Directory to enable strong authentication, signed and/or encrypted operations,
    and for storage of signed and/or encrypted data in the Directory. Attribute certificates
    can be used by the Directory to enable rule-based access control. Although the
    framework for these is provided in this Specification, the full definition of
    the Directory''s use of these frameworks, and the associated services provided
    by the Directory and its components, is supplied in the complete set of Directory
    Specifications.ISO/IEC 9594-8:2008, in the Authentication services framework,
    also:specifies the form of authentication information held by the Directory;describes
    how authentication information may be obtained from the Directory;states the assumptions
    made about how authentication information is formed and placed in the Directory;defines
    three ways in which applications may use this authentication information to perform
    authentication and describes how other security services may be supported by authentication.ISO/IEC
    9594-8:2008 describes two levels of authentication: simple authentication, using
    a password as a verification of claimed identity; and strong authentication, involving
    credentials formed using cryptographic techniques. While simple authentication
    offers some limited protection against unauthorized access, only strong authentication
    should be used as the basis for providing secure services. It is not intended
    to establish this as a general framework for authentication, but it can be of
    general use for applications that consider these techniques adequate.Authentication
    (and other security services) can only be provided within the context of a defined
    security policy. It is a matter for users of an application to define their own
    security policy, which may be constrained by the services provided by a standard.It
    is a matter for standards-defining applications that use the authentication framework
    to specify the protocol exchanges which need to be performed in order to achieve
    authentication based upon the authentication information obtained from the Directory.
    The protocol used by applications to obtain credentials from the Directory is
    the Directory Access Protocol (DAP) specified in ISO/IEC 9594-5.'
