    <p>ISO/IEC 23001-4:2009 defines the methods and general principles capable of describing codec configurations in the so-called reconfigurable video-coding (RVC) framework. It primarily addresses reconfigurable video aspects and will only focus on the description of representation for video codec configurations within the RVC framework. </p>
    <p>Within the scope of RVC framework, two languages, namely FNL and RVC-BSDL, are specified normatively. FNL is a language that describes the FND, also known as “network of FUs”. RVC-BSDL is a pertinent subset of BSDL defined in ISO/IEC 23001-5. This RVC-BSDL also includes possibilities for further extensions, which are necessary to provide complete description of video bitstreams.</p>
