  content: "IEC 60728-11:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60728-11:2023
    deals with the safety requirements applicable to fixed sited systems and equipment.
    As far as applicable, it is also valid for mobile and temporarily installed systems,
    for example, caravans. Additional requirements may be applied, for example, referring
    to:<br />\r\n- electrical installations of buildings and overhead lines,<br />\r\n-
    other telecommunication services distribution systems,<br />\r\n- water distribution
    systems,<br />\r\n- gas distribution systems,<br />\r\n- lightning systems.<br
    />\r\nThis document is intended to provide requirements specifically for the safety
    of the system, personnel working on it, subscribers and subscriber equipment.
    It deals only with safety aspects and is not intended to define a standard for
    the protection of the equipment used in the system. IEC 60728-11:2023 cancels
    and replaces the fourth edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) Replacement of references
    to IEC 60065 and IEC 60950-1 with references to IEC 62368-1.<br />\r\nb) Addition
    of subclauses 4.4 to 4.6.<br />\r\nc) Revised definition of class I equipment,
    class II equipment, main earthing terminal, see 3.1.6, 3.1.8 and 3.1.31.<br />\r\nd)
    Addition of definitions for harm, hazard, ordinary person, instructed person,
    skilled person, see 3.1.22, 3.1.23, 3.1.39, 3.1.40 and 3.1.41.<br />\r\ne) Additional
    requirement to provide details on the equipment installed, see 4.1.<br />\r\nf)
    Additional mechanical, design and construction requirements, see 4.2.2.<br />\r\ng)
    Changes to the accessible part requirements, see 4.2.3.<br />\r\nh) The current
    carrying capacity and dielectric strength of components is now obligatory, see
    8.1.3.<br />\r\ni) The assessment of the risk of lightning strike is now obligatory,
    see Figure 10.<br />\r\nj) Extension of remote feeding voltage on subscriber feeder,
    see Table 1."
