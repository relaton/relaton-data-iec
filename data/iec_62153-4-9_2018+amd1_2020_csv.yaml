abstract:
- content: "IEC 62153-4-9:2018+A1:2020 applies to metallic communication cables. It
    specifies a test method for determining the coupling attenuation aC of screened
    balanced cables. Due to the concentric outer tube, measurements are independent
    of irregularities on the circumference and external electromagnetic fields. A
    wide dynamic and frequency range can be applied to test even super screened cables
    with normal instrumentation from low frequencies up to the limit of defined transversal
    waves in the outer circuit at approximately 4 GHz. However, when using a balun,
    the upper frequency is limited by the properties of the balun. Measurements can
    be performed with standard tube procedure (respectively with standard test head)
    according to IEC 62153-4-4 or with open tube (open test head) procedure.<br />\r\nThe
    procedure described herein to measure the coupling attenuation aC is based on
    the procedure to measure the screening attenuation aS according to IEC 62153-4-4.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n–
    two test procedures, open head and standard head procedure;<br />\r\n– measuring
    with balun or with multiport respectively mixed mode VNA;<br />\r\n– extension
    of frequency range up to and above 2 GHz.<br /><strong>This consolidated version
    consists of the second edition (2018) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>"
