abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21122-1:2022 This document defines the syntax and an accompanying
    decompression process that is capable to represent continuous-tone grey-scale,
    or continuous-tone colour digital images without visual loss at moderate compression
    rates. Typical compression rates are between 2:1 and 6:1 but can also be higher
    depending on the nature of the image. In particular, the syntax and the decoding
    process specified in this document allow lightweight encoder and decoder implementations
    that limit the end-to-end latency to a fraction of the frame size. However, the
    definition of transmission channel buffer models necessary to ensure such latency
    is beyond the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n- specifies
    decoding processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image
    data;<br />\r\n- specifies a codestream syntax containing information for interpreting
    the compressed image data;<br />\r\n- provides guidance on encoding processes
    for converting source image data to compressed image data."
