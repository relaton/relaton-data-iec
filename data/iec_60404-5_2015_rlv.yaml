abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-5:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60404-5:2015 is to
    define the method of measurement of the magnetic flux density, magnetic polarization
    and the magnetic field strength and also to determine the demagnetization curve
    and recoil line of permanent magnet materials. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    adaption of the measurement methods and test conditions to newly introduced magnetically
    hard materials with coercivity values HcJ higher than 2 MA/m;<br />\r\n- update
    of the temperature conditions to allow the measurement of new materials with high
    temperature coefficients."
