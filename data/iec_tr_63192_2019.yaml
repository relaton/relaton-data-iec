abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63192:2019 provides the comparison of the hazard analysis requirements
    between IAEA framework and NRC-IEEE framework of standards and guidance. The hazard
    analysis requirements in the different standards were compared with a set of comparison
    criteria, including the safety principle, the safety process, the definitions,
    the hazard analysis process, etc. This document includes the comparison results
    of the HA requirements of the safety control systems of other safety industries
    in Annex C.<br />\r\nFor a nuclear power plant, the design safety and operation
    safety shall be analyzed, for example, to meet the IAEA Safety Requirements for
    Design (SSR-2/1) and Operation (SSRâ€‘2/2). The scope of this document is to survey
    the state of the art in the hazard analysis for the design of I&C system of NPPs."
