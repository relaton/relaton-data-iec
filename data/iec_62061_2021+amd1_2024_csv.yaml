abstract:
- content: "IEC 62061:2021+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies requirements and makes recommendations
    for the design, integration and validation of safety-related control systems (SCS)
    for machines. It is applicable to control systems used, either singly or in combination,
    to carry out safety functions on machines that are not portable by hand while
    working, including a group of machines working together in a coordinated manner.
    This document is a machinery sector specific standard within the framework of
    IEC 61508 (all parts). The design of complex programmable electronic subsystems
    or subsystem elements is not within the scope of this document. The main body
    of this sector standard specifies general requirements for the design, and verification
    of a safety-related control system intended to be used in high/continuous demand
    mode.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n- is concerned only with functional safety
    requirements intended to reduce the risk of hazardous situations;<br />\r\n- is
    restricted to risks arising directly from the hazards of the machine itself or
    from a group of machines working together in a coordinated manner;<br />\r\nThis
    document does not cover<br />\r\n- electrical hazards arising from the electrical
    control equipment itself (e.g. electric shock – see IEC 60204-1);<br />\r\n- other
    safety requirements necessary at the machine level such as safeguarding;<br />\r\n-
    specific measures for security aspects – see IEC TR 63074.<br />\r\nThis document
    is not intended to limit or inhibit technological advancement.<br />\r\nIEC 62061:2021
    cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2005, Amendment 1:2012 and
    Amendment 2:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- structure has been changed and contents have been
    updated to reflect the design process of the safety function,<br />\r\n- standard
    extended to non-electrical technologies,<br />\r\n- definitions updated to be
    aligned with IEC 61508-4,<br />\r\n- functional safety plan introduced and configuration
    management updated (Clause 4),<br />\r\n- requirements on parametrization expanded
    (Clause 6),<br />\r\n- reference to requirements on security added (Subclause
    6.8),<br />\r\n- requirements on periodic testing added (Subclause 6.9),<br />\r\n-
    various improvements and clarification on architectures and reliability calculations
    (Clause 6 and Clause 7),<br />\r\n- shift from \"SILCL\" to \"maximum SIL\" of
    a subsystem (Clause 7),<br />\r\n- use cases for software described including
    requirements (Clause 8),<br />\r\n- requirements on independence for software
    verification (Clause 8) and validation activities (Clause 9) added,<br />\r\n-
    new informative annex with examples (Annex G),<br />\r\n- new informative annexes
    on typical MTTFD values, diagnostics and calculation methods for the architectures
    (Annex C, Annex D and Annex H)."
