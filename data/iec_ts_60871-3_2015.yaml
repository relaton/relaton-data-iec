abstract:
- content: "IEC/TS 60871-3:2015(E) which is a technical specification, gives guidance
    on the protection of shunt capacitors and shunt capacitor banks. it applies to
    capacitors according to IEC 60871-1. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Clearer writing of formulas on energy limitation
    for expulsion fuses;<br />\r\n- Updated normative references and bibliography;<br
    />\r\n- A new clause for synchronized switching has been added. Keywords: shunt
    capacitors, shunt capacitor banks"
