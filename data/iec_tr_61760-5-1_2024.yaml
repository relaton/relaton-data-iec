abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61760-5-1:2024 describes examples of methods using electrical strain
    gauges for determination of critical mechanical stresses in assembly processes.
    These stresses can damage chip type ceramic components, causing so called “bending
    cracks”. Area-array components are excluded from the scope of this document.
