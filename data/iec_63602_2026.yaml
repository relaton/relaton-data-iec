abstract:
- content: "IEC 63602:2026 specifies how to correctly display essential parameters
    of SiC-based PECS devices having a gate dielectric region biased to turn devices
    on and off. This typically refers to MOS devices such as MOSFETs and IGBTs. In
    this document, only NMOS devices are discussed as these are dominant for power
    device applications; however, the procedures apply to PMOS devices as well. In
    contrast to silicon power MOSFETs certain aspects of SiC power MOSFETs require
    a dedicated approach in order to represent device parameters correctly in the
    datasheet. Details are explained in the following paragraphs, among others the
    most important topics are:<br />\r\n- substantially higher switching speeds ad
    high VDS;<br />\r\n- strong impact of test setup (see Clause 5);<br />\r\n- impact
    of body diode as a function of the applied negative gate bias ant the limitations
    arising for the VG(off) values depending on the actual device.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not define device failure criteria, acceptable use conditions or acceptable
    lifetime targets. That is up to the device manufacturers and users. However, it
    provides stress procedures such that the threshold voltage stability over time
    as affected by gate bias and temperature can be demonstrated and evaluated."
