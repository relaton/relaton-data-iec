abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60904-1-2:2019 describes procedures for the measurement of the
    current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of bifacial photovoltaic devices in natural
    or simulated sunlight. It is applicable to single PV cells, sub-assemblies of
    such cells or entire PV modules.<br />\r\nThis document may be applicable to PV
    devices designed for use under concentrated irradiation if they are measured without
    the optics for concentration, and irradiated using direct normal irradiance and
    a mismatch correction with respect to a direct normal reference spectrum is performed.
    This document describes the additional requirements for the measurement of I-V
    characteristics of bifacial PV devices."
