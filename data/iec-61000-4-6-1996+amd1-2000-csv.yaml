  content: |-
    Relates to the conducted immunity requirements of electrical and
    electronic equipment to electromagnetic disturbances coming from
    intended radio-frequency (RF) transmitters in the frequency range 9
    kHz up to 80 MHz. Equipment not having at least one conducting
    cable (such as mains supply, signal line or earth connection), which
    can couple the equipment to the disturbing RF fields is excluded.

    This standard does not intend to specify the tests to be applied to
    particular apparatus or systems. Its main aim is to give a general
    basic reference to all concerned product committes of the IEC. The
    product committees (or users and manufacturers of equipment) remain
    responsible for the appropriate choice of the test and the severity
    level to be applied to their equipment.
