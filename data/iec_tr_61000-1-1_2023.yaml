abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-1-1:2023 which is a Technical Report, aims to describe and
    interpret various terms considered to be of basic importance to concepts and practical
    application in the design and evaluation of electromagnetically compatible equipment
    and systems. In addition, attention is drawn to the distinction between electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) tests carried out in a standardized set-up and those carried
    out at other locations, for example at premises where a device, equipment or system
    is manufactured or at the location where a device, equipment or system is installed
    (in situ tests or measurements). This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 1992. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the general description of the electromagnetic
    environment has been updated in accordance with IEC TR 61000-2-5;<br />\r\nb)
    the description of source, of potentially susceptible equipment/systems and of
    coupling mechanism has been updated,<br />\r\nc) elements from IEC TR 61000-2-3,
    that is intended to be withdrawn, as well as from IEC TR 61000-2-5, have been
    incorporated into this document."
