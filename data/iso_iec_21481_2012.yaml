abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18092, ISO/IEC 14443 and ISO/IEC 15693 specify the radio frequency
    signal interface, initialization, anti-collision and protocols for wireless interconnection
    of closely coupled devices and access to contactless integrated circuit cards
    operating at 13,56 MHz.</p><p>This International Standard specifies the communication
    mode selection mechanism, designed not to disturb any ongoing communication at
    13,56 MHz, for devices implementing ISO/IEC 18092, ISO/IEC 14443 or ISO/IEC 15693.
    This International Standard requires implementations to enter the selected communication
    mode as specified in the respective International Standard. The communication
    mode specifications, however, are outside the scope of this International Standard.</p>"
