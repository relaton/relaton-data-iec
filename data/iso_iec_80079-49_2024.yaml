abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 80079-49:2024 specifies the requirements for flame arresters that
    prevent flame transmission when explosive gas-air or vapour-air mixtures are present.
    It establishes uniform principles for the classification, basic construction and
    information for use, including the marking of flame arresters, and specifies test
    methods to verify the safety requirements and determine safe limits of use.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to pressures ranging from 80 kPa to 160 kPa
    and temperatures ranging from -20 °C to +200 °C.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    apply to the following:<br />\r\n- external safety-related measurement and control
    equipment that might be required to keep the operational conditions within the
    established safe limits;<br />\r\n- flame arresters used for explosive mixtures
    of vapours and gases, which tend to self-decompose (for example, acetylene) or
    which are chemically unstable;<br />\r\n- flame arresters used for carbon disulfide,
    due to its special properties;<br />\r\n- flame arresters whose intended use is
    for mixtures other than gas-air or vapour-air mixtures (for example, higher oxygen-nitrogen
    ratio, chlorine as oxidant);<br />\r\n- flame arrester test procedures for reciprocating
    internal combustion engines;<br />\r\n- fast acting valves, extinguishing systems
    and other explosion isolating systems;<br />\r\n- Flame arresters used in gas
    detectors (those being covered for example, by IEC 60079‑29‑1 and IEC 62990‑1).<br
    />\r\nThis edition cancels and replaces ISO 16852:2016, which has been technically
    revised. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to ISO 16852:2016:<br
    />\r\na) adaptation of the relevant IEC TC 31 requirements on standards;<br />\r\nb)
    modification of the upper limit of the temperature range from 150 °C to 200 °C
    under the condition that T0 shall be not larger than 80 % of the auto ignition
    temperature of the gas-air-mixture;<br />\r\nc) change of the term \"explosion
    group\" to \"equipment group\" due to editorial requirements in IEC/TC 31;<br
    />\r\nd) clarification of the conditions and requirements for flame arresters
    whose intended operating conditions are outside the atmospheric conditions in
    7.3.4 and 7.3.5;<br />\r\ne) clarification of the requirements on the information
    for use in Clause 12 f) concerning the burn time;<br />\r\nf) addition of a permission
    to the construction requirements both in 7.1 and 14.1 to substitute visual inspection
    by performing a flow test;<br />\r\ng) addition of a flow chart for the evaluation
    of test results as Annex D"
