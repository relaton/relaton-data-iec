  content: "IEC 62067:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62067:2022
    specifies test methods and requirements for power cable systems, cables with extruded
    insulation and their accessories for fixed installations, for rated voltages above
    150 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 170 kV) up to and including 500 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub>
    = 550 kV). The requirements apply to single-core cables and to their accessories
    for usual conditions of installation and operation, but not to special cables
    and their accessories, such as submarine cables, for which modifications to the
    standard tests can be necessary or special test conditions that may need to be
    devised. This document does not cover transition joints between cables with extruded
    insulation and paper insulated cables."
