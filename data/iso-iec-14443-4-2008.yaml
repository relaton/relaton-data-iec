    <p>ISO/IEC 14443 is one of a series of International Standards describing the parameters for identification cards as defined in ISO/IEC 7810, and the use of such cards for international interchange.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 14443-4:2008 specifies a half-duplex block transmission protocol featuring the special needs of a contactless environment and defines the activation and deactivation sequence of the protocol.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 14443-4:2008 is intended to be used in conjunction with other parts of ISO/IEC 14443 and is applicable to proximity cards or objects of Type A and Type B.</p>
