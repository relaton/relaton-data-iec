- content: Provides the description of the protocol (abstract syntax) and procedures
    for the Reliable Transfer Service Element services (ISO/IEC 9066-1). The RTSE

    peer RTSE protocol machines through the use of ACSE and the presentation-service;
    b) the interactions between the RTSE protocol machine and its service-user. Prescribes
    the conformance requirements for systems implementing these procedures.
