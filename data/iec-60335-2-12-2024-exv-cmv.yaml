  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-12:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-12:2024 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-12:2024 deals with the safety of electric warming
    plates, warming trays and similar appliances intended to keep food or vessels
    warm, for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nAppliances intended for normal household and similar use and that can also
    be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms are within the
    scope of this standard. However, if the appliance is intended to be used professionally
    to keep vessels warm or to process food for commercial consumption, the appliance
    is not considered to be for household and similar use only.<br />\r\nAs far as
    is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or in aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br
    />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n–
    appliances made of flexible material, such as textile material;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended exclusively to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for commercial catering (IEC 60335 2 49,
    IEC 60335 2 50);<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n– warming cabinets.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the
    fifth edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 5.2, 7.12, 15.2, 15.101, 24.1.5);<br />\r\nc) application of test
    probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) clarification of applicability
    of requirements for remote operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part
    2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its
    amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
