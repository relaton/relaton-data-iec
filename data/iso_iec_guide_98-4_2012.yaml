abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 98-4:2012 provides guidance and procedures for assessing
    the conformity of an item (entity, object or system) with specified requirements.
    The item might be, for example, a gauge block, a grocery scale or a blood sample.
    The procedures can be applied where the following conditions exist: the item is
    distinguished by a single scalar quantity (a measurable property) defined to a
    level of detail sufficient to be reasonably represented by an essentially unique
    true value; an interval of permissible values of the property is specified by
    one or two tolerance limits; the property can be measured and the measurement
    result expressed in a manner consistent with the principles of the GUM, so that
    knowledge of the value of the property can be reasonably described by (a) a probability
    density function, (b) a distribution function, (c) numerical approximations to
    such functions, or (d) a best estimate, together with a coverage interval and
    an associated coverage probability.<br /><br />\r\nThe procedures developed in
    this document can be used to realize an interval, called an acceptance interval,
    of permissible measured values of the property of interest. Acceptance limits
    can be chosen so as to balance the risks associated with accepting non-conforming
    items (consumer's risk) or rejecting conforming items (producer's risk).<br /><br
    />\r\nTwo types of conformity assessment problems are addressed. The first is
    the setting of acceptance limits that will assure that a desired conformance probability
    for a single measured item is achieved. The second is the setting of acceptance
    limits to assure an acceptable level of confidence on average as a number of (nominally
    identical) items are measured. Guidance is given for their solution.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis document contains examples to illustrate the guidance provided. The
    concepts presented can be extended to more general conformity assessment problems
    based on measurements of a set of scalar measurands. The audience of this document
    includes quality managers, members of standards development organizations, accreditation
    authorities and the staffs of testing and measuring laboratories, inspection bodies,
    certification bodies, regulatory agencies, academics and researchers."
