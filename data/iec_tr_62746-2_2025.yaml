abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62746-2:2025, which is a technical report, describes the main pillars
    of interoperability to assist different IEC Technical Committees in defining their
    interfaces and messages covering the whole chain between a Smart Grid and Smart
    Home/Building/Industrial area.<br />\r\nThe main topics of this document are:<br
    />\r\n– To describe an architecture model from a logical point of view;<br />\r\n–
    To describe a set of user stories that describe a number of situations related
    to energy flexibility and demand side management as well as an outline of potential
    upcoming Smart Building and Smart Home scenarios. The set of user stories does
    not have the ambition to list all home and building (energy) management possibilities,
    but is meant as a set of examples that are used as input in use cases and to check
    that the set of use cases is complete;<br />\r\n– To describe a set of use cases
    based on the user stories and architecture. The use cases describe scenarios in
    which the communication between elements of the architecture are identified;<br
    />\r\n– To further detail the communication, identified in the use cases, by describing
    the messages and information to be exchanged.<br />\r\nThis document can also
    be used as a blueprint for further smart home solutions like remote control, remote
    monitoring, ambient assistant living and so forth.<br />\r\nThis technical report
    will be regularly revised by introducing new use cases and updating the current
    use cases. The use cases presented in this document are not going to be included
    in the IEC Use Case Management Repository (UCMR). The data models of some use
    cases presented here are defined in the second edition of IEC 62746-4. The smart
    grid architecture model presented in this document is created in coordination
    with IEC TC13, SC23, and TC57<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The Architecture Model of the Smart Grid
    Coordination Group (Figure 6) has been replaced with the draft Architecture Model
    of TC57 in collaboration with SC23K and TC13;<br />\r\nb) The use cases from Edition
    1 (2015) with the following IDs have been removed from the current document: JWG2000,
    JWG2001, JWG2010, JWG202x, JWG2041, JWG2042, JWG1111, WGSP2120, JWG30xx;<br />\r\nc)
    The use cases from Edition 1 (2015) with the following IDs: JWG1100, JWG1101,
    JWG-SPUC1102, and JWG1103 have been replaced with the use case JWG1100;<br />\r\nd)
    The following use cases have been added to the current document: JWG3000, JWG3001,
    JWG3002, JWG3003, JWG3004, JWG3005, JWG3006, JWG4000."
