  content: "IEC 60502-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60502-1:2021
    specifies the construction, dimensions and test requirements of power cables with
    extruded solid insulation for rated AC voltages of 1 kV (Um = 1,2 kV) and 3 kV
    (Um = 3,6 kV) for fixed installations such as distribution networks or industrial
    installations. Cables of rated AC voltage 1 kV (Um = 1,2 kV) designed and tested
    in accordance with this document can also be used, if declared by the manufacturer,
    in DC distribution systems having their nominal voltage ≤ 750 V DC (with a maximum
    of 900 V DC) between a live conductor and neutral/earth, or ≤ 1 500 V DC (with
    a maximum 1 800 V DC) between two live conductors. Applicable core identification
    for DC systems are considered in accordance with local installation regulations."
