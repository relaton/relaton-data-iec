  content: "IEC 60598-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60598-1:2020 specifies
    general requirements for luminaires, incorporating electric light sources for
    operation from supply voltages up to 1 000 V. The requirements and related tests
    of this document cover: classification, marking, mechanical construction, electrical
    construction and photobiological safety. This ninth edition cancels and replaces
    the eighth edition published in 2014 and Amendment 1:2017. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Revision of Clause 4.30,
    Fixing cover live parts of non-user replaceable light source;<br />\r\n- Subclause
    4.24.2, Blue Light Hazard: removal of Risk Group 0;<br />\r\n- Subclause 5.2.16:
    additional requirements for AC mains appliance inlets related to IEC 61984;<br
    />\r\n- Addition of Subclause 3.3.25, UV protection of cable;<br />\r\n- Addition
    of Clause 4.34, Inclusion of EMF safety requirements (IEC 62493);<br />\r\n- Revision
    of the requirements for functional earth and protective earth;<br />\r\n- Addition
    of Clause 4.35, Protection against fast rotating parts;<br />\r\n- Revision of
    Clause 3.2, Rated voltage marking;<br />\r\n- Revision of Subclause 5.2.10, Cord
    anchorage;<br />\r\n- Revision of Annex G for touch current and protective conductor
    current test set-up;<br />\r\n- Addition of requirements for constant light output
    function and programmable current output;<br />\r\n- Revision of Subclause 8.2.3
    c), touch voltage limits for interrupted DC voltage;<br />\r\n- Introduction of
    PELV;<br />\r\n- Introduction of Ethernet power supply connection for luminaires
    (PoE);<br />\r\n- Section 9, Introduction of IPX9;<br />\r\n- Addition of Subclause
    3.3.26 for wall mounted luminaires;<br />\r\n- Revision of Annex D introducing
    alternative thermal tests for luminaires with ta marking higher than 25°C;<br
    />\r\n- Revision of Table 10.3 and Subclause 3.3.19 for protective conductor current
    limits;<br />\r\n- Track-mounted luminaires: cross reference to Annex A of IEC
    60570:2003/AMD2:2019;<br />\r\n- Revision of Subclause 10.2.2, alternative DC
    electric strength test;<br />\r\n- Revision of Annex D for recessed luminaires;<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 4.12.5: revision of Table 4.2 for torque test on metal glands;<br
    />\r\n- Revision of use of bridging capacitors in luminaires;<br />\r\n- Revision
