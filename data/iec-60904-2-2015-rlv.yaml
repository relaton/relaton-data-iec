  content: "IEC 60904-2:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60904-2:2015 gives
    requirements for the classification, selection, packaging, marking, calibration
    and care of photovoltaic reference devices. This standard covers photovoltaic
    reference devices used to determine the electrical performance of photovoltaic
    cells, modules and arrays under natural and simulated sunlight. The main technical
    changes with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- addition
    of a test procedure in simulated sunlight of subsequent measurement of primary
    and secondary reference device;<br />\r\n- definition of standard test conditions;<br
    />\r\n- reduction of allowed diffuse component for secondary reference cell calibration."
