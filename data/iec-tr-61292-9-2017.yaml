  content: "IEC TR 61292-9:2017(E) which is a Technical Report, focuses on semiconductor
    optical amplifiers (SOAs), especially the specific features and measurement of
    gain and polarization dependent gain (PDG). In this document, only the amplifying
    application of SOAs is described. Other applications, such as modulation, switching
    and non-linear functions, are not covered. Potential applications of SOAs, however,
    such as reflective SOAs (RSOAs) for the seeded wavelength division multiplexing
    passive optical network (WDM-PON), are briefly reviewed in Annex A. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2013. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of
    new terms;<br />\r\nb) clarification of noise figure definition.<br />\r\nKeywords:
    semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), gain and polarization dependent gain
    (PDG)"
