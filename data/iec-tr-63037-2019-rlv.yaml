  content: "IEC TR 63037:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC TR 63037:2019 provides
    guidance to controlgear/integrated lamp designers for the development of products
    suitable to operate with future phase-cut dimmers. It describes the possible voltage
    signals and the expected response of the controlgear/integrated lamps. This document
    describes the expected response of controlgear during all operation states of
    a phase-cut lighting system and provides a complete understanding of the requirements
    for phase-cut dimmers. The response of a phase-cut dimmer is described in IEC
    60669-2‑1:—, Annex EE. This document specifies the system performance aspects
    and test procedures for the control by mains voltage phase-cut dimming of the
    brightness of mains operated electronic lighting equipment intended to be controlled
    by mains voltage phase-cut dimmers, such as LED integrated lamps and light sources
    with external controlgear. Safety requirements are not covered by this document,
    but by respective product standards. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- emission of audible noise;<br />\r\n- ghosting
    caused by issues that are not related to the power supply of the dimmer or synchronization;<br
    />\r\n- stability of phase angle waveform (for the dimmer), including symmetry
    and stability tests;<br />\r\n- flicker of light loads;<br />\r\n- repetitive
    ring up voltage;<br />\r\n- dimming range; and<br />\r\n- number of switching
    cycles have been added.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
