- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the characteristics of a series of related 130 mm optical disk</p><p>cartridges
    (ODCs) by using a number of Type designations.</p><p>A disk has two sides, called
    Side A and Side B. Each side can have a nominal capacity of 2,6 Gbytes.</p><p><strong>Type
    R/W</strong>provides for data to be written, read and erased many times over the</p><p>recording
    surface of the corresponding disk side, using the thermo-magnetic</p><p>and magneto-optical
    effects.</p><p><strong>Type P-ROM</strong>provides for a part of the disk surface
    to be pre-recorded and reproduced by</p><p>stamping or other means. This part
    of the disk is read without recourse to</p><p>the magneto-optical effect. All
    parts which are not pre-recorded provide for</p><p>data to meet the requirements
    of Type R/W.</p><p><strong>Type O-ROM</strong>provides for the whole of the disk
    surface to be pre-recorded and reproduced</p><p>by stamping or other means. The
    corresponding disk sides are read without</p><p>recourse to the magneto-optical
    effect.</p><p><strong>Type DOW</strong>provides for data to be written and read
    many times over the recording</p><p>surface of the corresponding disk side, using
    the direct overwrite thermomagnetic</p><p>and magneto-optical effects requiring
    a single external magnetic</p><p>field.</p><p><strong>Type P-DOW</strong>provides
    for a part of the disk surface to be pre-recorded and reproduced by</p><p>stamping
    or other means. This part of the disk is read without recourse to</p><p>the magneto-optical
    effect. All parts which are not pre-recorded provide for</p><p>data to meet the
    requirements of Type DOW.</p><p><strong>Type WO</strong>provides write once, read
    multiple functionality using the thermo-magnetic</p><p>and magneto-optical effects.</p><p><strong>Type
    WO-DOW</strong>provides write once, read multiple functionality using the direct
    overwrite</p><p>thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.</p><p>In addition,
    for each Type, this International Standard provides for cartridges containing
    a disk with a</p><p>sector size of 512 bytes, cartridges containing a disk with
    a sector size of 1 024 bytes and cartridges</p><p>containing a disk with a sector
    size of 2 048 bytes. All sectors of a disk are the same size.</p><p>This International
    Standard specifies</p><p>- the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference
    Drive;</p><p>- the environments in which the cartridges are to be operated and
    stored;</p><p>- the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the
    cartridge, so as to</p><p>provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing
    systems;</p><p>- the format of the information on the disk, both embossed and
    user-written, including</p><p>the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors,
    the error correction codes, the</p><p>modulation methods used;</p><p>- the characteristics
    of the embossed information on the disk;</p><p>- the magneto-optical characteristics
    of the disk, enabling processing systems to write</p><p>data onto the disk;</p><p>-
    the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing</p><p>systems
    to read data from the disk.</p><p>This International Standard provides for interchange
    between optical disk drives. Together with a</p><p>Standard for volume and file
    structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing</p><p>systems.</p>
