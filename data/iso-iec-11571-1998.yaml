    <p>This International Standard defines the requirements for the handling of network addresses for the identification of entities</p>
    <p>which use or provide telecommunication services offered by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). This International</p>
    <p>Standard covers numbering, including the requirements for the support of a Private Numbering Plan, the addressing of</p>
    <p>network service access points for open systems interconnection (OSI NSAP addressing), and the support of subaddressing.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable to Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges with broad-band and narrow-band</p>
    <p>capabilities (PINX) and to terminals to be attached to the access of PINXs. Any use by a PINX of the Support of Private</p>
    <p>Numbering Plans supplementary service provided by a public ISDN is outside the scope of this International Standard.</p>
    <p>Although this International Standard does not explicitly describe its application to location-independent (mobile) addressable</p>
    <p>entities, this application is not precluded.</p>
