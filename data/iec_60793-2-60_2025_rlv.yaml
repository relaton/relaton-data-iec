abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-2-60:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-2-60:2025
    is applicable to optical fibre types C1, C2, C3, and C4, as described in Table
    1. These fibres are used for the interconnections within or between optical components
    systems and are optimized to support dense optical connectivity. While the fibres
    can be overcoated or buffered for the purpose of making protected pigtails, they
    can be used without overcoating. They can, however, be colour coded. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    replacement of \"intraconnection\" with \"interconnection\" and addition of the
    definition of \"interconnection fibres\";<br />\r\nb) modification of the nominal
    MFD limit of C1 fibres;<br />\r\nc) addition of \"Primary coating diameter-coloured\"
    limits for class C fibres and change of \"Primary coating diameter-uncoloured\"
    limits for class C_80 fibres;<br />\r\nd) change of coating strip force limits
    for class C1, class C2, and class C3 fibres;<br />\r\ne) replacement of \"Fibre
    cut-off wavelength\" with \"Cable cut-off wavelength\" and revision of \"Note
    b\" in Table 6;<br />\r\nf) replacement of \"Fibre cut-off wavelength\" with \"Cable
    cut-off wavelength\" and deletion of the \"Note\" in Table 8;<br />\r\ng) addition
    of 200 μm coating diameter requirements for C1_125 fibres and change of coating
    diameters limits for C1_80 fibres in Table A.1;<br />\r\nh) addition of 200 µm
    coating diameter requirements for C1_125 fibres and change of coating strip force
    limits in Table A.2 and in Table A.5;<br />\r\ni) replacement of \"Fibre cut-off
    wavelength\" with \"Cable cut-off wavelength\", modification of the \"Cable cut-off
    wavelength\" limit and addition of a new \"Note\" in Table A.3;<br />\r\nj) addition
    of a transmission requirements at 1 625 nm and deletion of 1 310 nm for C1 fibres
    in Table A.4;<br />\r\nk) modification of \"Fibre cut-off wavelength\" limits
    of C3 fibres in Table C.3;<br />\r\nl) replacement of \"Fibre cut-off wavelength\"
    with \"Cable cut-off wavelength\" for C4 fibres in Table D.3."
