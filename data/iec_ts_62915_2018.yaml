abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62915:2018(E) sets forth a uniform approach to maintain type approval,
    design and safety qualification of terrestrial PV modules that have undergone,
    or will undergo modification from their originally assessed design. Changes in
    material selection, components and manufacturing process can impact electrical
    performance, reliability and safety of the modified product. This document lists
    typical modifications and the resulting requirements for retesting based on the
    different test standards. This document is closely related to the IEC 61215 and
    IEC 61730 series of standards.
