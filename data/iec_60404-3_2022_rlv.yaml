abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60404-3:2022
    is applicable to grain-oriented and non-oriented electrical steel strip and sheet
    for measurement of AC magnetic properties at power frequencies. The object of
    this document is to define the general principles and the technical details of
    the measurement of the magnetic properties of electrical steel strip and sheet
    by means of a single sheet tester (SST). This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Annex A was
    revised. The method of determining the yokesâ€™ lamination resistance was added
    to Annex A;<br />\r\n- Annex B of the consolidated version of 2010 referred to
    calibration of the SST using the Epstein method. It was cancelled;<br />\r\n-
    Annex B (new), Annex C and Annex D were revised, they are for information only;<br
    />\r\n- Annex C was modified taking account of the new situation regarding P and
    R grades;<br />\r\n- Annex D was amended by addition of Clause D.4 on the numerical
    air flux compensation."
