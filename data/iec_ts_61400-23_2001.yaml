abstract:
- content: Is a technical specification providing guidelines for the full-scale structural
    testing of wind turbine blades and for the interpretation or evaluation of results,
    as a possible part of a design verification of the integrity of the blade. Includes
    static strength tests, fatigue tests, and other tests determining blade properties.<br
    /><br />This publication is of high relevance for Smart Grid.
