  content: "IEC 62138:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62138:2018
    specifies requirements for the software of computer-based instrumentation and
    control (I&C) systems performing functions of safety category B or C as defined
    by IEC 61226. It complements IEC 60880 which provides requirements for the software
    of computer-based I&C systems performing functions of safety category A. It is
    consistent with, and complementary to, IEC 61513. Requirements that are not specific
    to software are deferred to IEC 61513. This new edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    align the standard with standards published or revised since the first edition,
    in particular IEC 61513, IEC 60880, IEC 62645 and IEC 62671;<br />\r\n- merge
    two clauses in order to avoid repetitions of text;<br />\r\n- introduce requirements
    on traceability in consistency with IEC 61513;<br />\r\n- introduce new annexes."
