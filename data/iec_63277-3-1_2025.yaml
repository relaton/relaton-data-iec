abstract:
- content: "IEC 63277-3-1:2025 describes the safety requirements of binary power generation
    systems based on organic Rankine cycle (ORC) with less than 500 kW in output capacity.<br
    />\r\nThis document covers significant hazards, hazardous situations, and events,
    with the exception of those associated with environmental compatibility (installation
    conditions), relevant to binary power generation systems (ORC), when they are
    used as intended and under the conditions foreseen by the manufacturer."
