    <p>ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format and associated system requirements for volume and boot block recognition,</p>
    <p>volume structure, file structure and record structure for the interchange of information on media between users of</p>
    <p>information processing systems.</p>
    <p>The media shall be recorded as if the recording of sectors may be done in any order.</p>
    <p>Note 1 - The medium is not restricted to being of only one type; the type of medium may be either write once, or read only, or</p>
    <p>rewritable, or a combination of these types.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 13346 consists of the following five Parts:</p>
    <p>Part 1: General</p>
    <p>Part 2: Volume and Boot Block Recognition</p>
    <p>Part 3: Volume Structure</p>
    <p>Part 4: File Structure</p>
    <p>Part 5: Record Structure</p>
    <p>Annex A - ICB Strategies, is part of ISO/IEC 13346-4.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format and associated system requirements for volume structure by</p>
    <p>specifying:</p>
    <p>  the attributes of a volume and the descriptors recorded on it;</p>
    <p>  the relationship among volumes of a volume set;</p>
    <p>  the attributes of a partition of a volume;</p>
    <p>  the attributes of a logical volume and the descriptors recorded on it;</p>
    <p>  levels of medium interchange;</p>
    <p>  requirements for the processes which are provided within information processing systems, to enable</p>
    <p>information to be interchanged between different systems; for this purpose, it specifies the functions to be</p>
    <p>provided within systems which are intended to originate or receive media which conform to this part of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 13346.</p>
