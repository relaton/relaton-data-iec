  content: "IEC TS 62257-2:2015(E) proposes a methodological approach for the setting
    up and carrying out of socio-economic studies as part of the framework of decentralized
    rural electrification projects. It is addressed to project teams and in particular
    to experts in charge of socio-economic studies in international projects. This
    technical specification also provides some structures as technical solutions that
    could be recommended, depending on the qualitative and quantitative energy demands,
    consistent with the needs and financial situation of the customers. The main technical
    changes with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- redefine
    the maximum AC voltage from 500 V to 1 000 V, the maximum DC voltage from 750
    V to 1 500 V;<br />\r\n- removal of the limitation of 100 kVA system size.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/searchform&amp;q=62257\">IEC
    62257 series</a>."
