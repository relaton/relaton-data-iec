abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-214:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62271-214:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62271-1:2017+AMD1:2021 CSV.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-214:2024 specifies
    requirements for internal arc classification of AC metal-enclosed pole-mounted
    switchgear and controlgear with rated voltages above 1 kV and up to and including
    52 kV with service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. This document is applicable
    to three-phase, two-phase and single-phase open terminal equipment for which an
    internal arc classification is assigned. Enclosures may include fixed and removable
    components and may be filled with fluid (liquid or gas) to provide insulation.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    indicators positioning update;<br />\r\nb) neutral earthing connection of the
    test circuit for three-phase tests;<br />\r\nc) general review for consistency
    with IEC 62271-200, Ed.3.0:2021."
