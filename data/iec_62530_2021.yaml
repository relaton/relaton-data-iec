abstract:
- content: "IEC 62530:2021(E) provides the definition of the language syntax and semantics
    for the IEEE 1800â„¢ SystemVerilog language, which is a unified hardware design,
    specification, and verification language. The standard includes support for behavioral,
    register transfer level (RTL), and gate-level hardware descriptions; testbench,
    coverage, assertion, object-oriented, and constrained random constructs; and also
    provides application programming interfaces (APIs) to foreign programming languages.<br
    />\r\nThis edition corrects errors and clarifies aspects of the language definition
    in IEEE Std 1800-2012.1 This revision also provides enhanced features that ease
    design, improve verification, and enhance cross-language interactions.<br />\r\nThis
    publication has the status of a double logo IEEE/IEC standard."
