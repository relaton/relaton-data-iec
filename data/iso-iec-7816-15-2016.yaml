    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-15:2016 specifies an application in a card. This application contains information on cryptographic functionality. This part of ISO/IEC 7816 defines a common syntax and format for the cryptographic information and mechanisms to share this information whenever appropriate. </p>
    <p>The objectives of this part of ISO/IEC 7816 are to</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      facilitate interoperability among components running on various platforms (platform neutral),</li>
    <li>-      enable applications in the outside world to take advantage of products and components from multiple manufacturers (vendor neutral),</li>
    <li>-      enable the use of advances in technology without rewriting application-level software (application neutral), and</li>
    <li>-      maintain consistency with existing, related standards while expanding upon them only where necessary and practical.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It supports the following capabilities:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      storage of multiple instances of cryptographic information in a card;</li>
    <li>-      use of the cryptographic information;</li>
    <li>-      retrieval of the cryptographic information, a key factor for this is the notion of "Directory Files", which provides a layer of indirection between objects on the card and the actual format of these objects;</li>
    <li>-      cross-referencing of the cryptographic information with DOs defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 7816 when appropriate; </li>
    <li>-      different authentication mechanisms;</li>
    <li>-      multiple cryptographic algorithms (the suitability of these is outside the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 7816).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-15.2016 does not cover the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside world. It is not mandatory for implementations complying with this International Standard to support all options described.</p>
    <p>In case of discrepancies between ASN.1 definitions in the body of the text and the module in Annex A, Annex A takes precedence.</p>
