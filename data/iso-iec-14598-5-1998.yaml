    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 14598 provides requirements and recommendations for the practical</p>
    <p>implementation of software product evaluation when several parties need to understand, accept and</p>
    <p>trust evaluation results. In particular, it may be used to apply the concepts described in</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9126.</p>
    <p>The process described in this part of ISO/IEC 14598 defines the activities needed to analyse</p>
    <p>evaluation requirements, to specify, design and perform evaluation actions and to conclude the</p>
    <p>evaluation of any kind of software product.</p>
    <p>The evaluation process may be used to evaluate already existing products, provided the needed</p>
    <p>product components are available, or to evaluate products in development.</p>
    <p>NOTE For the evaluation of a product in development, the evaluation process needs to be</p>
    <p>synchronized with the software development process and product components are evaluated as they</p>
    <p>are delivered.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 14598 may be used by</p>
    <p>- testing laboratory evaluators, when providing software product evaluation services,</p>
    <p>- software suppliers, when planning evaluation of their products, including evaluation to be</p>
    <p>carried out by independent testing services,</p>
    <p>- software acquirers, when requesting evaluation information from a supplier or testing service,</p>
    <p>- software users when evaluating products or when using evaluation reports provided by testing</p>
    <p>laboratories,</p>
    <p>- certification bodies in defining new certification schemes for software products.</p>
