  content: "IEC PAS 63125:2017(E) specifies methods for measuring the performance
    of clothes washing machines for commercial use utilizing cold and/or hot water
    supplies and without heating or with heating devices for electricity, steam or
    gas. It also deals with appliances for both washing and drying textiles (washer-dryers)
    with respect to their washing-related functions. This PAS covers top, front and
    side-loaded non-household washing machines with horizontal or vertical axes and
    with one or more wash compartments.<br />\r\nThe object is to state and define
    the principal performance characteristics of non-household washing machines and
    to describe the test methods for measuring these characteristics.<br />\r\nNon
    household tumble dryer performance is assessed to CLC/TS 50594.<br />\r\nThis
    PAS does not apply to continuous batch washing machines (e.g. tunnel washers)
    or washing machines only possible to operate with automatic loading and unloading.<br
    />\r\nThis PAS does not specify safety requirements for non-household washing
    machines. Safety requirements are specified in EN 50571 and the EN ISO 10472 series."
