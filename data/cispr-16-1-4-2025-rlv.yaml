  content: "CISPR 16-1-4:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCISPR 16-1-4:2025
    specifies the characteristics and performance of equipment for the measurement
    of radiated disturbances in the frequency range 9 kHz to 18 GHz. Specifications
    for antennas and test sites are included.<br />\r\nNOTE In accordance with IEC
    Guide 107. CISPR 16-1-4 is a basic EMC publication for use by product committees
    of the IEC. As stated in Guide 107, product committees are responsible for determining
    the applicability of the EMC standard. CISPR and its sub-committees are prepared
    to cooperate with product committees in the evaluation of the value of particular
    EMC tests for specific products.<br />\r\nThe requirements of this publication
    apply at all frequencies and for all levels of radiated disturbances within the
    CISPR indicating range of the measuring equipment. Methods of measurement are
    covered in CISPR 16-2-3, further information on radio disturbance is given in
    CISPR TR 16-3, and uncertainties, statistics, and limit modelling are covered
    in CISPR 16-4 series. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition
    published in 2019, Amendment 1:2020 and Amendment 2:2023. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of
    the definition 3.1.7 and of the general introduction 8.1.1 for CMAD;<br />\r\nb)
    introduction of a new cable termination device, the very high frequency line impedance
    stabilization network (VHF-LISN) in 8.2;<br />\r\nc) addition of definition 3.1.34
    for VHF-LISN, 3.1.20 for reference ground, 3.1.21 for reference ground plane and
    3.1.31 for TN‑C‑S power system;<br />\r\nd) various non-technical editorial, style,
    and wording adjustments for consistency with drafting rules."
