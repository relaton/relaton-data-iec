  content: "IEC 62024-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62024-1:2024
    specifies the electrical characteristics and measuring methods for the nanohenry
    range chip inductor that is normally used in the high frequency (over 100 kHz)
    range.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of S parameter measurement;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of the inductance, Q-factor and impedance of an inductor which
    are measured by the reflection coefficient method with a network analyzer;<br
    />\r\nc) addition of the resonance frequency of an inductor which is measured
    by a two-port network analyzer;<br />\r\nd) addition of the mounting method for
    a surface mounting inductor with Pb-free solder.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum
    1 (2025-12) has been included in this copy."
