It provides guidelines and general principles on how the specified requirements can be met using established messaging and other technical methods.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable to all forms of exchange and sharing of sensitive information, both public and private, nationally and internationally, within the same industry or market sector or between sectors. In particular, it may be applicable to information exchanges and sharing relating to the provision, maintenance and protection of an organization's or nation state's critical infrastructure. It is designed to support the creation of trust when exchanging and sharing sensitive information, thereby encouraging the international growth of information sharing communities.</p>
