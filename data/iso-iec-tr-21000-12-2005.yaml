    <p>ISO/IEC TR 21000-12:2005 specifies a test bed that is designed to assist in performance assessment of MPEG-21, Scalable Video Codec (SVC) for streaming applications, and for the evaluation of resource delivery technologies over unreliable packet-switched networks. The streaming protocols used in the test bed are based on RTSP and RTP. The Network Adaptation QoS mechanism of MPEG-21 Digital Item Adaptation (DIA) is used for bandwidth-scalable streaming. A subset of MPEG-4 IPMP is also included in the test bed so that encrypted streaming and layered access functionality of a DRM system can be tested for different SVC designs.</p>
    <p>The test bed includes a network emulator GUI that interfaces with a Linux-based network emulator, NistNet, for real-time emulation of channel characteristics of various networks. Therefore:</p>
    <ul><li>Various scalable codec (audio, video, scene composition) technologies can be evaluated.</li><li>Various packetization methods and file formats can be evaluated.</li><li>Various multimedia streaming rate control and error control mechanisms can be plugged into the test bed and evaluated.</li></ul>
    <p>In summary, the following MPEG technologies are demonstrated by the test bed:</p>
    <ul><li>MPEG scalable audio and video codecs;</li><li>MPEG-4 on IP;</li><li>MPEG-4 IPMP (a small subset); and</li><li>MPEG-21 DIA Network Adaptation QoS.</li></ul>
    <p>The architecture and the API are not tied to any particular media codecs. However, currently only the MPEG-4 FGS video and MPEG-4 BSAC audio are officially supported by the software. The support for ISO/IEC 21000-13 (MPEG-21 part 13) SVC will be included when that International Standard is ready.</p>
