- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: IEC 62541-2:2020 describes the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) security
    model. It describes the security threats of the physical, hardware, and software
    environments in which OPC UA is expected to run. It describes how OPC UA relies
    upon other standards for security. It provides definition of common security terms
    that are used in this and other parts of the OPC UA specification. It gives an
    overview of the security features that are specified in other parts of the OPC
    UA specification. It references services, mappings, and Profiles that are specified
    normatively in other parts of the OPC UA Specification. It provides suggestions
    or best practice guidelines on implementing security. Any seeming ambiguity between
    this part and one of the other normative parts does not remove or reduce the requirement
    specified in the other normative part.
