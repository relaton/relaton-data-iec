abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-11:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61156-11:2023
    describes cables intended to be used for single balanced pair (office, home, industrial)
    applications according to ISO/IEC 11801-1. An example of existing application
    is 1000BASE-T1, see ISO/IEC TR 11801-9906. The transmission characteristics of
    these cables are specified up to a frequency of 1,25 GHz and at a temperature
    of 20 Â°C. The T1-C type cable is specified up to 600 MHz, the T1-D type cable
    up to 1,25 GHz. Depending on the MICE environment and the installation conditions
    either unscreened or screened cables can be used. A blank detail specification
    can be found in Annex A."
