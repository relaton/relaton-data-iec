  content: "IEC 60601-2-68:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-68:2025
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of X-ray based IMAGE-GUIDED
    RADIOTHERAPY equipment for use with EXTERNAL BEAM EQUIPMENT (EBE). This document
    covers safety aspects of kilovoltage (kV) and megavoltage (MV) X-ray imaging devices
    integrated in a specified geometrical relationship with EBE for the purpose of
    IGRT. It covers aspects of communication and relationships between the EXTERNAL
    BEAM EQUIPMENT and X-ray imaging devices, attached or not directly attached to,
    but in the same RADIATION shielded area as, and dedicated for use only with, the
    EXTERNAL BEAM EQUIPMENT. This document deals with equipment for OFFLINE X-IGRT,
    ONLINE X-IGRT and REAL-TIME X-IGRT. It covers procedures to reduce the risk of
    over-reliance on the X-IGRT EBE SYSTEM. For example, in the case of ONLINE X-IGRT,
    the MANUFACTURER will provide an interactive interface for user interaction with
    the correction suggested by the system. This document does not apply to CT SCANNERS,
    X-RAY EQUIPMENT for RADIOGRAPHY, and X-RAY EQUIPMENT for RADIOSCOPY, which are
    not intended for use for IGRT. Requirements that are being tested according to
    another standard can be identified by the manufacturer and if equivalent do not
    require retesting, instead evidence can refer to the CT SCANNER, X-RAY EQUIPMENT
    for RADIOGRAPHY, or X-RAY EQUIPMENT for RADIOSCOPY EQUIPMENT manufacturer's providing
    compliance statements or test reports. If the X-IGRT EQUIPMENT is combined with
    an MEE, any requirement that is the same for the X-IGRT EQUIPMENT and the MEE,
    such as a PATIENT POSITIONER, is not required to be tested twice, but can be accepted
    as tested by the MEE. This document applies for X-ray equipment for radiography,
    radioscopy, and COMPUTER tomography used for IGRT. If a clause or subclause is
    specifically intended to be applicable to X-IGRT EBE SYSTEMS, the content of that
    clause or subclause will say so. Where that is not the case, the clause or subclause
    applies only to X-IGRT EQUIPMENT.<br />\r\nThis document, with the inclusion of
    TYPE TESTS and SITE TESTS, applies respectively to the MANUFACTURER and some installation
    aspects of X-IGRT EBE SYSTEMS intended to be:<br />\r\n• for NORMAL USE, operated
    under the authority of the RESPONSIBLE ORGANIZATION by QUALIFIED PERSONS having
    the required skills for a particular medical application, for particular specified
    clinical purposes, e.g., STATIONARY RADIOTHERAPY or MOVING BEAM RADIOTHERAPY,<br
    />\r\n• maintained in accordance with the recommendations given in the INSTRUCTIONS
    FOR USE, and<br />\r\n• subject to regular quality assurance performance and calibration
    checks by a QUALIFIED PERSON.<br />\r\nIEC 80601-2-68:2024 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with the new editions of the relevant
    standards:<br />\r\n– IEC 60601-2-1:2020;<br />\r\n– IEC 60601-2-44:2009, IEC
    60601-2-44:2009/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601-2-44:2009/AMD2:2016;<br />\r\n– IEC 60601-2-64:2014;<br
    />\r\nb) clarification of the use of IEC 60601-2-68 for CT SCANNERS, X-RAY EQUIPMENT
    for RADIOGRAPHY and RADIOSCOPY used in the same room with an EXTERNAL BEAM EQUIPMENT
    (EBE);<br />\r\nc) introduction of updated requirements related to MECHANICAL
    HAZARDS, RADIATION HAZARDS, PROGRAMMABLE ELECTRICAL MEDICAL SYSTEMS (PEMS), ACCOMPANYING
    DOCUMENTATION of an ME SYSTEM, and REMOTE OPERATION."
