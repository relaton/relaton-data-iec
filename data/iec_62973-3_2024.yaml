abstract:
- content: "IEC 62973-3:2024 establishes the framework for the selection and operation
    of lead acid batteries of the VRLA type for auxiliary power supply systems on
    rolling stock of railways and complements IEC 62973-1, unless otherwise specified.
    This document provides guidance and links to standards for the required battery
    qualification tests procedures and safety measures to be implemented. In this
    document, the most appropriate clauses of these cited standards have been selected
    and adapted as needed to reflect the intended use of these batteries as auxiliary
    power sources on rolling stock of railways.<br />\r\nThe battery-specific requirements
    for subcomponents of battery systems such as containers, charging controls, temperature
    probes, nameplates and similar are covered in this document as needed.<br />\r\nCharging
    systems are excluded from the scope of this document."
