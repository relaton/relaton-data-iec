abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23006-2:2011 specifies a set of Application Programming Interfaces
    (APIs) so that MXM Applications executing on an MXM Device can access the standard
    multimedia technologies contained in its Middleware as MXM Engines, as specified
    by ISO/IEC 23006-1.<br /><br /><br />\r\nThe APIs belong to the following two
    classes:<br /><br /><br />\r\nthe MXM Engine APIs, i.e. the collection of the
    individual MXM Engine APIs providing access to a single MPEG technology (e.g.
    video coding) or to a group of MPEG technologies where this is convenient;<br
    />\r\nthe MXM Orchestrator API, i.e. the API of the special MXM Engine that is
    capable of creating chains of MXM engines to execute a high-level application
    call such as Play, as opposed to the typically low-level MXM Engine API calls."
