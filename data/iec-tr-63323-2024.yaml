  content: "IEC TR 63323:2024 deals with a new proposal for an SC adaptor connector
    which includes a flexible retaining element on its top surface, compared to the
    SC standard adaptor.<br />\r\nWith this solution, when the SC plug connector is
    in place, any accidental disconnection is difficult, as it employs an external
    tool or a particular unlocking manoeuvre.<br />\r\nThis new adaptor is intended
    primarily for the home network customer optical fibre termination, but it can
    be used in every situation where safety issues are important (e.g. main distribution
    frames in central offices, cross-connect cabinets, street cabinets, termination
    boxes).<br />\r\nIt consists of a push-latch-pull mating sequence connection with
    the assistance of a suitable tool.<br />\r\nThis solution assures compatibility
    with the existing SC interface standard according to IEC 61754-4."
