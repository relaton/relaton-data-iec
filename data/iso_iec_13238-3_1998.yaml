abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 13238 enables the bulk transfer of all or part
    of the data contained in an</p><p>Information Resource Dictionary (IRD) or in
    an Information Resource Dictionary Definition</p><p>conforming to ISO/IEC 10728:1993
    IRDS Services Interface.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 13238 defines a format for
    such a transfer and also services to generate</p><p>the export file and services
    to import the file. These services are additional to the existing</p><p>services
    defined in the IRDS Services Interface.</p><p>This version of this part of ISO/IEC
    13238 defines a limited set of Export and Import</p><p>services. It is expected
    that implementations will also provide more sophisticated services</p><p>based
    on the use of the Transfer File structure defined in this part of ISO/IEC 13238.</p><p>The
    physical way in which the transfer takes place is outside the scope of this part
    of</p><p>ISO/IEC 13238. Each transfer may be effected in one of several ways including
    the physical</p><p>transfer of the data using a transportable storage device.</p>"
