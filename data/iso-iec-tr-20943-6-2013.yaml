    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 covers the framework for generating ontologies based on ISO/IEC 11179-3, and provides the procedure and mapping model for generating ontologies.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 describes a method to generate ontologies for a context using concepts in ISO/IEC 11179-3. Most ontologies are basically composed of classes (concepts), properties, relations between classes, and instances (objects or individuals). ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 considers the generation of ontology consisting of a subset of ontology components required for defining ontologies at the conceptual level which is called "FGO_Ontology". ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 uses the prefix "FGO_" to avoid confusion from homonym and to clearly identify each term. For example, "Property" is specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3 as well as in ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013, but the meaning is slightly different. ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 defines FGO_Class, FGO_Property, and FGO_Relation to distinguish between components of FGO_Ontology and components of ISO/IEC 11179-3.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 specifies the method to generate ontologies using registered concepts in ISO/IEC 11179-3 Concepts metamodel region and Data description metamodel region. ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 specifies a procedure and method for generating ontologies due to an application domain reusing concepts registered in a metadata registry.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20943-6:2013 does not include a way to describe in a specific ontology description language, such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), RDF Schema (RDFS), Web Ontology Language (OWL), Topic Map, and Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF).</p>
