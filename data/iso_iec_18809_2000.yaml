abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the physical and magnetic characteristics of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge</p><p>containing
    a memory chip to enable physical interchange of such cartridges between drives.
    It also specifies the quality of the</p><p>recorded signals, the recording method
    and the recorded format - called Advanced Intelligent Tape No. 1 with Memory In</p><p>Cartridge
    (AIT-1 with MIC) - thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of
    such magnetic tape cartridges.</p><p>The System Log is recorded in the MIC.</p><p>This
    International Standard specifies two types of cartridge depending on the thickness
    of the magnetic tape contained in the</p><p>case.</p><p>Information interchange
    between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange
    parties upon the</p><p>interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure
    and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p>
