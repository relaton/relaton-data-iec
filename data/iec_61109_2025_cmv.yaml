abstract:
- content: "IEC61109:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61109:2025 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61109:2008
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 36 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\nIEC 61109:2025 applies to composite insulators for overhead lines consisting
    of a load-bearing cylindrical insulating solid core consisting of fibres - usually
    glass - in a resin-based matrix, a housing (surrounding the insulating core) made
    of polymeric material and metal end fittings permanently attached to the insulating
    core. Composite insulators covered by this document are intended for use as suspension/tension
    line insulators, but these insulators could occasionally be subjected to compression
    or bending, for example when used as interphase-spacers. Guidance on such loads
    is outlined in Annex C.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is to:<br />\r\n-
    define the terms used,<br />\r\n- specify test methods,<br />\r\n- specify acceptance
    criteria.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- extension of this document to apply both to AC and
    DC systems;<br />\r\n- modifications of Clause 3, Terms, definitions and abbreviations;<br
    />\r\n- removal of Clause 7, Hybrid insulators, from this document;<br />\r\n-
    modifications of tests procedures recently included in IEC 62217 (hydrophobicity
    transfer test, stress corrosion, water diffusion test on the core with housing);<br
    />\r\n- modifications on environmental conditions;<br />\r\n- modifications on
    classification of tests and include the relevance of the interfaces;<br />\r\n-
    clarification and modification of the parameters determining the need to repeat
    design and type tests;<br />\r\n- revision of Table 1;<br />\r\n- revision of
    electrical type tests;<br />\r\n- revision of re-testing procedure of sample test;<br
    />\r\n- addition of a new Annex D on electric field control for AC;<br />\r\n-
    addition of a new Annex E on typical sketch for composite insulators assembly;<br
    />\r\n- addition of a new Annex F on mechanical evaluation of the adhesion between
    core and housing;<br />\r\n- addition of a new Annex G on applicability of design-
    and type tests for DC applications."
