abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 specifies a metadata system for describing multimedia
    content. ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 specifies the Multimedia Description Schemes (MDS)
    description tools (Description Schemes, Descriptors, and datatypes) that comprise
    ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 by specifying the normative syntax of each description tool
    using Description Definition Language (DDL) (see ISO/IEC 15938-2) and the normative
    semantics including semantics of each component of each description tool (attributes
    and elements). ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 also provides informative examples that illustrate
    the instantiation of description tools in creating descriptions conforming to
    ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 defines the following
    basic elements: schema tools (the root element, top-level types, description metadata,
    and packages), basic datatypes (integers, reals, vectors, matrices), linking and
    media localization tools (spatial and temporal localization), basic description
    tools (language, text, classification schemes). ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 defines the
    following content description tools, which describe the features of the multimedia
    content and the immutable metadata related to the multimedia content: structure
    description tools (spatio-temporal segments of multimedia content) and semantic
    description tools (\"real-world\" semantics related to or captured by the multimedia
    content, including objects, events, concepts, and so forth). ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003
    defines additionally the following description tools for content metadata: media
    description (storage format, encoding), creation and production (title, creator,
    classification, purpose), and usage (access rights, publication). The content
    description and metadata tools are related in the sense that the content description
    tools use the content metadata tools. For example, a description of creation and
    production or media information can be attached to an individual video or video
    segment in order to describe the structure and creation and production of the
    multimedia content. ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 also defines description tools for navigation
    and access (browsing, summarization), content organization (collections and models),
    and user interaction (user preferences pertaining to consumption of multimedia
    and usage history). Finally, ISO/IEC 15938-5:2003 defines classification schemes,
    which organize terms that are used by the description tools."
