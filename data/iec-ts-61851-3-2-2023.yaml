  content: IEC TS 61851-3-2:2023 This part of IEC 61851, which is a Technical Specification,
    applies to the portable and mobile DRI EV supply equipment where the protection
    against electric shocks relies on double or reinforced insulation, and with double
    or reinforced insulation between all AC and DC inputs and outputs with a rated
    input voltage being not more than 250 V AC and output voltages not more than 120
    V DC.
