abstract:
- content: "IEC 62037-3:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62037-3:2025
    defines the impact test on coaxial connectors to evaluate their robustness against
    weak connections and particles inside the connector, as independently as possible
    from the effects of cable passive intermodulation (PIM). For other connectors
    (e.g. panel mounted connectors), the cable can be replaced by an adequate transmission
    line (e.g. airline, stripline). In order to evaluate the effects of mechanical
    stresses on the connectors, a series of impacts is applied to the connectors while
    measuring the PIM.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) impact test requirements for multi-channel connectors
    added;<br />\r\nb) method for calculating impact energy added for connector shapes
    other than round;<br />\r\nc) revised test considerations for achieving maximum
    PIM in reverse (reflected) PIM measurements;<br />\r\nd) added clarification that
    PIM tests reports shall include the maximum PIM value measured."
