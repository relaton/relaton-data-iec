abstract:
- content: "<p>This document establishes the requirements for systems engineering
    activities to be performed on projects of defence agencies, including the United
    States (US) Department of Defense (DoD), across the entire system life cycle.
    This document implements ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use by defence agencies in acquiring
    systems or systems engineering support, including the planning, acquisition, operation,
    modification, and sustainment of defence systems. It provides the foundation for
    systems engineering within the context of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. This document provides
    detailed requirements for the application of the life cycle processes, activities,
    and tasks of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use on any defence system and includes the
    effective integration of agreement processes, technical processes, technical management
    processes, organizational project enabling processes, and essential specialty
    engineering requirements. While primarily supporting the acquirer-supplier agreement
    mode, this document also can be used to support the other modes: use by organizations,
    projects, and process assessors.</p>"
