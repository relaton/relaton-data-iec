abstract:
- content: "This document specifies mechanisms for cross-domain password-based authenticated
    key exchange, all of which are four-party password-based authenticated key exchange
    (4PAKE) protocols. Such protocols let two communicating entities establish a shared
    session key using just the login passwords that they share with their respective
    domain authentication servers. The authentication servers, assumed to be part
    of a standard public key infrastructure (PKI), act as ephemeral certification
    authorities (CAs) that certify key materials that the users can subsequently use
    to exchange and agree on as a session key.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify
    the means to be used to establish a shared password between an entity and its
    corresponding domain server. This document also does not define the implementation
    of a PKI and the means for two distinct domain servers to exchange or verify their
    respective public key certificates."
