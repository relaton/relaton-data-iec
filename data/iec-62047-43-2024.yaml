  content: 'IEC 62047-43:2024 specifies the test method of electrical characteristics
    after cyclic bending deformation for flexible electromechanical devices. These
    devices include passive micro components and active micro components on the flexible
    film or embedded in the flexible film. The desired in-plane dimensions of the
    device for the test method ranges typically from 1 mm to 300 mm and the thickness
    ranges from 10 μm to 1 mm, but these are not limiting values. The test method
    is so designed as to understand and further visualize the entire performance deterioration
    behaviour after cyclic bending deformation in a concept of 3D (P-S-N: Performance
    - Severity of bending - Number of cycles) plot over the loading space of severity
    of bending and number of repeated cycles. This document is essential to estimate
    safety margin over the operation period under a certain level of cyclic bending
    deformation and indispensable for reliable design of the product employing these
    devices.'
