  content: IEC TR 62967:2018(E) provides guidance on the assurance of reliability
    data of automation devices. If the source of this data is through calculation,
    guidance is given on how to specify the methods used for this calculation. If
    the source is through observations, guidance is given on how to describe these
    observations and their evaluations. If the source is the outcome of laboratory
    tests, guidance is given on how to specify these tests and the conditions under
    which they have been carried out. This document defines the form to present the
    data.
