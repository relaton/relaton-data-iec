abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 960 MHz industrial, scientific, and
    medical (ISM) band used in item management applications. It provides a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that can be used to develop RFID application
    standards. This document is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage
    inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international
    marketplace.</p><p>It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical
    attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel
    accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic radiated power
    (EIRP), spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit
    rate accuracy, bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels,
    frequency hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further
    defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.</p><p>This document
    specifies the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter, Interrogator-Talks-First
    (ITF) systems. The system comprises Interrogators, also known as readers, and
    tags, also known as labels. An Interrogator receives information from a tag by
    transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag responds by
    modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering an
    information signal to the Interrogator. The system is ITF, i.e. a tag modulates
    its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal only after being
    directed to do so by an Interrogator.</p><p>This document specifies</p><p>— physical
    interactions (the signalling layer of the communication link) between Interrogators
    and tags;</p><p>— logical operating procedures and commands between Interrogators
    and Tags;</p><p>— the collision arbitration scheme used to identify a specific
    tag in a multiple-tag environment;</p><p>— optional security commands that allow
    the use of crypto suites of ISO/IEC 29167.</p>"
