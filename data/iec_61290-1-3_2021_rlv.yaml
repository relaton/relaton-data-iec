abstract:
- content: "IEC 61290-1-3:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61290-1-3:2021
    applies to all commercially available optical amplifiers (OA) and optically amplified
    subsystems. It applies to OA using optically pumped fibres (OFA based on either
    rare-earth doped fibres or on the Raman effect), semiconductors (SOA), and waveguides
    (POWA).<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The applicability of the test methods described in this
    document to distributed Raman amplifiers is for further study. The object of this
    document is to establish uniform requirements for accurate and reliable measurements,
    by means of the optical power meter test method, of the following OA parameters,
    as defined in IEC 61291-1:<br />\r\n- nominal output signal power;<br />\r\n-
    gain;<br />\r\n- polarization-dependent gain;<br />\r\n- maximum output signal
    power;<br />\r\n- maximum total output power.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 All numerical values
    followed by (â€¡) are suggested values for which the measurement is assured. Other
    values can be acceptable upon verification.<br />\r\nThis document applies to
    single-channel amplifiers. For multichannel amplifiers,<br />\r\nIEC 61290-10
    (all parts) applies. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- harmonization with IEC 61290-1-1;<br />\r\n- use of the term
    \"measurement uncertainty\" instead of \"measurement accuracy\"."
