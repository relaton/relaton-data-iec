  script: Latn
  content: Aims at evaluating the reliability of nonhermetic packaged solid-state
    devices in humid environments. Employs conditions of temperature, humidity, and
    bias which accelerate the penetration of moisture through the external protective
    material or along the interface between the external protective material and the
    metallic conductors which pass through it.
