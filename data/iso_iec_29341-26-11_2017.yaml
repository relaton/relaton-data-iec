abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-11:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service
    type referred to herein as the MediaManagement service.</p><p>The MediaManagement
    service enables the feature to set-up a media session on a Telephony Client (TC),
    under the control of a Telephony Control Point (TelCP). This service provides
    the following functions:</p><p>- Set up a media session to send and/or receive
    media streams between a TC and a TS. To set up a media session, The MediaManagement
    service provides an interface for a TelCP to negotiate the media capabilities
    (e.g., codec types, IP address, port number etc.) between a TC and a TS. This
    ensures a TelCP to select a common set of the media capabilities to be used to
    send and/or receive media streams between a TS and a TC. After the media session
    is established, the TC starts sending and/or receiving media streams based on
    the media chapabilities negotiated between the TC and the TS.</p><p>- The mechanism
    to modify the media capabilities of an existing media session. For instance, if
    a media session is created for sending and receiving an audio media stream, it
    is possible to modify the media session for sending and receiving a video media
    stream.</p><p>- The mechanism to terminate a media session.</p>"
