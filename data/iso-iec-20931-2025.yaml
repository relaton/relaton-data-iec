    to specify the function and to indicate status of the serviced offices and their
    services. The icons are used as the user interfaces for searching, booking, and
    advertising applications for serviced offices. This document specifies basic icons
    that define the functions of all serviced offices, and also specifies additional
    and miscellaneous icons that indicate other services. The functions specified
    by the icons include facilities, equipment and services for fulfilling various
