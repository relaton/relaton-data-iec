  content: "IEC 62282-3-201:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62282-3-201:2025
    provides test methods for the electrical, thermal, and environmental performance
    of small stationary fuel cell power systems that meet the following criteria:<br
    />\r\n- output: rated electric power output of less than 10 kW;<br />\r\n- output
    mode: grid-connected/independent operation or stand-alone operation with single-phase
    AC output or 3-phase AC output not exceeding 1 000 V, or DC output not exceeding
    1 500 V;<br />\r\n- operating pressure: maximum allowable working pressure of
    0,1 MPa (gauge) for the fuel and oxidant passages;<br />\r\n- fuel: gaseous fuel
    (natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, propane, butane, hydrogen, etc.) or liquid
    fuel (kerosene, methanol, etc.);<br />\r\n- oxidant: air.<br />\r\nThis document
    describes type tests and their test methods only. No routine tests are required
    or identified, and no performance targets are set in this document.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides test methods to be carried out under laboratory conditions.<br
    />\r\nThis document covers fuel cell power systems whose primary purpose is the
    production of electric power and whose secondary purpose can be the utilization
    of heat. Accordingly, fuel cell power systems for which the use of heat is primary,
    and the use of electric power is secondary are outside the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2017 and Amendment 1:2022. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of Introduction;<br
    />\r\n- revision of terms and definitions;<br />\r\n- revision of Table 1;<br
    />\r\n- revision of Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4;<br />\r\n- revision
    of measurement instruments (10.2);<br />\r\n- revision of minimum required measurement
    systematic uncertainty (10.4);<br />\r\n- revision of test conditions (Clause
    11);<br />\r\n- revision of operating process (Clause 12);<br />\r\n- revision
    of fuel consumption test (14.2);<br />\r\n- revision of heat recovery test (14.4);<br
    />\r\n- revision of Figure 13 and Figure 14;<br />\r\n- revision of calculation
    of results (14.14.4);<br />\r\n- revision of Annex A and Annex B.</p>"
