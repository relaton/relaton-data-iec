abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 25434:2007 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of 120 mm recordable optical disks with capacities of 8,55 Gbytes and 17,1 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written once and read many times using
    a non-reversible method. These disks are identified as +R DL.ISO/IEC 25434:2007
    also specifies 80 mm disks with capacities of 2,66 Gbytes and 5,32 Gbytes. These
    disks have the same characteristics as the 120 mm disks, except for some parameters
    related to the smaller dimensions. All parameters unique for the 80 mm disks are
    specified in a normative annex.ISO/IEC 25434:2007 specifiestwo related but different
    Types of this disk;the conditions for conformance;the environments in which the
    disk is to be tested, operated and stored;the mechanical, physical and dimensional
    characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data
    processing systems;the format of the information on the disk, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding
    method;the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling
    data processing systems to read the data from the disk.ISO/IEC 25434:2007 provides
    for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems.
