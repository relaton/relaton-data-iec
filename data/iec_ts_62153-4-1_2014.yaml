abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62153-4-1:2014(E) deals with screening measurements. Screening (or
    shielding) is one basic way of achieving electromagnetic compatibility (EMC).
    However, a confusingly large number of methods and concepts is available to test
    for the screening quality of cables and related components, and for defining their
    quality. This technical specification gives a brief introduction to basic concepts
    and terms trying to reveal the common features of apparently different test methods.
    It is intended to assist in correct interpretation of test data, and in the better
    understanding of screening (or shielding) and related specifications and standards.
    This technical specification cancels and replaces the second edition of the technical
    report IEC/TR 62153-4-1 published in 2010.
