abstract:
- content: "IEC 60981:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60981:2019 specifies requirements
    for extra heavy-duty electrical rigid steel (EHDERS) conduits, couplings, nipples
    and elbows for electrical installations, including communications and fibre optics.
    This document also specifies threads for these components. It is not applicable
    to the conduits specified in IEC 60423. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the second edition:<br />\r\n- addition of provisions for alternative coatings
    to zinc;<br />\r\n- addition of elasticity test for organic coatings;<br />\r\n-
    new Annex B on tests for evaluating alternative exterior coatings applied on extra
    heavyÂ­duty electrical rigid steel (EHDERS) conduits.</p>"
