  content: "IEC TS 60815-2:2025, which is a technical specification, is applicable
    for the selection of ceramic and glass insulators for AC systems, and the determination
    of their relevant dimensions, to be used in high-voltage systems with respect
    to pollution. This document applies to insulators for outdoor installation only.<br
    />\r\nThis document gives specific guidelines and principles to arrive at an informed
    judgement on the probable behaviour of a given insulator in certain pollution
    environments.<br />\r\nThe basis for the structure and approach of this document
    is fully explained in IEC TS 60815­-1.<br />\r\nThe objective of this document
    is to give the user means to:<br />\r\n- determine the reference unified specific
    creepage distance (RUSCD) from site pollution severity (SPS) value or class;<br
    />\r\n- evaluate the suitability of different insulator profiles;<br />\r\n- determine
    the necessary USCD by applying corrections for insulator shape, size, position,
    etc. to the RUSCD;<br />\r\n- if required, determine the appropriate test methods
    and parameters to verify the performance of the selected insulators.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition of IEC TS 60815-2, together with IEC TS 60815-1, cancels and replaces
    the first edition of IEC TS 60815-2 published in 2008. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Some terms
    and definitions are modified or introduced in this document, such as USCD, nominal
    creepage distance, RUSCD, creepage factor, insulator trunk, etc.;<br />\r\nb)
    From RUSCD of reference insulator to USCD of candidate insulator, the correction
    factors are introduced and revised, such as altitude correction, diameter correction,
    shed profile correction and parallel insulator number correction;<br />\r\nc)
    Profile suitability on ceramic and glass insulators was simplified."
