abstract:
- content: "<p>Is intended for use in guiding the design and application of real interworking
    units and real subnetworks (e.g. local area networks and private packet switched
    networks) which are to support the OSI network service. As the principal means
    for expressing the definition, the concept of the network internal layer service
    is used. The definition includes the invocation of network routing functions as
    a necessary element of the network relaying functions. The definition of network
    relaying functions applies both to a subnetwork supporting all elements of the
    network service and to a network relay system interconnecting two subnetworks.</p>"
