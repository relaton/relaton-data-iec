abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-20:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60749-20:2020
    provides a means of assessing the resistance to soldering heat of semiconductors
    packaged as plastic encapsulated surface mount devices (SMDs). This test is destructive.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- incorporation of a technical corrigendum to
    IEC 60749-20:2008 (second edition );<br />\r\n- inclusion of new Clause 3;<br
    />\r\n- inclusion of explanatory notes."
