abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 21277:2018 defines test methods to measure the performance of
    crypto suites of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (tags and interrogators)
    for item management as specified in ISO/IEC 18000‑63 and ISO/IEC 29167 (all parts).</p><p>These
    test methods measure the crypto suite system performance (tags and interrogators)
    against the crypto suite outcomes as required by the desired set of use case requirements
    for a specific application/service. These test methods are used as an extension
    of ISO/IEC 18046‑1 but can be used in a standalone manner.</p><p>Crypto suite
    performance can vary substantially between crypto suites, implementations of a
    crypto suite for tags and interrogators and crypto suite outcomes in specific
    interrogation scenarios. Tag crypto functions require time and energy to complete
    successfully. The desired crypto strength and method influence the time and energy
    required. "Crypto suite performance" is therefore defined in this document as
    "the shortest time to complete a crypto outcome at a given read distance in relation
    to the RF power available". This document provides guidelines in the evaluation
    of the measurement results.</p><p>The test methods do not measure crypto capabilities
    which include crypto strength, suitability and robustness. They neither measure
    random generator performance nor deal with key management.</p>
