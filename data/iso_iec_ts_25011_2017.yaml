abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 is applicable
    to IT services that support the needs of an individual user or a business. IT
    services can be delivered personally or remotely by people, or by an IT application
    that could be in a local or remote location (see Annex A).</p><p>These include
    two types of IT services:</p><p>a) services completely automated provided by an
    IT system;</p><p>b) services provided by a human using an IT system.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 25011:2017 describes the use of two quality models for IT services.</p><p>a)
    ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 defines an IT service quality model composed of eight characteristics
    (which are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) that relate to properties
    of the IT service made up from a combination of elements including people, processes,
    technology, facilities and information.</p><p>b) ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 describes
    how the quality in use model in ISO/IEC 25010 which is composed of five characteristics
    (some of them are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) can be applied
    to the outcome when an IT service is used in a particular context of use. This
    model is applicable to the complete service provision system composed of people,
    processes, technology, facilities and information.</p><p>The characteristics and
    sub-characteristics provide consistent terminologies and check lists for specifying,
    measuring and evaluating IT service quality.</p><p>The use of the IT service quality
    models can help:</p><p>- IT service providers to identify service quality requirements,
    and evaluate and improve the quality of the service provided;</p><p>- customers
    to specify their requirements for the quality of service, define the acceptance
    criteria for service, and evaluate the quality of an IT service; and</p><p>- a
    third party to evaluate the quality of an IT service.</p>
