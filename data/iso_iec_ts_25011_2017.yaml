abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 is applicable to IT services that support the
    needs of an individual user or a business. IT services can be delivered personally
    or remotely by people, or by an IT application that could be in a local or remote
    location (see Annex A).</p><p>These include two types of IT services:</p><p>a)
    services completely automated provided by an IT system;</p><p>b) services provided
    by a human using an IT system.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 describes the use of
    two quality models for IT services.</p><p>a) ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 defines an
    IT service quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further
    subdivided into sub-characteristics) that relate to properties of the IT service
    made up from a combination of elements including people, processes, technology,
    facilities and information.</p><p>b) ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 describes how the quality
    in use model in ISO/IEC 25010 which is composed of five characteristics (some
    of them are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) can be applied to the
    outcome when an IT service is used in a particular context of use. This model
    is applicable to the complete service provision system composed of people, processes,
    technology, facilities and information.</p><p>The characteristics and sub-characteristics
    provide consistent terminologies and check lists for specifying, measuring and
    evaluating IT service quality.</p><p>The use of the IT service quality models
    can help:</p><p>- IT service providers to identify service quality requirements,
    and evaluate and improve the quality of the service provided;</p><p>- customers
    to specify their requirements for the quality of service, define the acceptance
    criteria for service, and evaluate the quality of an IT service; and</p><p>- a
    third party to evaluate the quality of an IT service.</p>"
