abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 is applicable to IT services that support the needs
    of an individual user or a business. IT services can be delivered personally or
    remotely by people, or by an IT application that could be in a local or remote
    location (see Annex A). These include two types of IT services:<br />\r\na) services
    completely automated provided by an IT system;<br />\r\nb) services provided by
    a human using an IT system.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 describes the
    use of two quality models for IT services:<br />\r\na) ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 defines
    an IT service quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further
    subdivided into sub-characteristics) that relate to properties of the IT service
    made up from a combination of elements including people, processes, technology,
    facilities and information.<br />\r\nb) ISO/IEC TS 25011:2017 describes how the
    quality in use model in ISO/IEC 25010 which is composed of five characteristics
    (some of them are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) can be applied
    to the outcome when an IT service is used in a particular context of use. This
    model is applicable to the complete service provision system composed of people,
    processes, technology, facilities and information.<br /><br />\r\nThe characteristics
    and sub-characteristics provide consistent terminologies and check lists for specifying,
    measuring and evaluating IT service quality.<br /><br />\r\nThe use of the IT
    service quality models can help:<br />\r\n- IT service providers to identify service
    quality requirements, and evaluate and improve the quality of the service provided;<br
    />\r\n- customers to specify their requirements for the quality of service, define
    the acceptance criteria for service, and evaluate the quality of an IT service;
    and<br />\r\n- a third party to evaluate the quality of an IT service."
