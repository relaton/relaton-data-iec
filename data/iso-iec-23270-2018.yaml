    <p>This specification describes the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the C# programming language. It describes:</p>
    <p>—          The representation of C# programs;</p>
    <p>—          The syntax and constraints of the C# language;</p>
    <p>—          The semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;</p>
    <p>—          The restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.</p>
    <p>This specification does not describe</p>
    <p>—          The mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;</p>
    <p>—          The mechanism by which C# applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;</p>
    <p>—          The mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C# application;</p>
    <p>—          The mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;</p>
    <p>—          The size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;</p>
    <p>—          All minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.</p>
