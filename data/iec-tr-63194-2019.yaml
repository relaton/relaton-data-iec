  content: "IEC TR 63194:2019 which is a Technical Report, examines the need for and
    intent of colour coding of optical fibre cables. Further, this document lists
    the major colour codes in various regions throughout the world. Noting that decades
    of discussion of a universal recommended colour coding scheme has failed to bring
    about an agreement, this document does not intend to promote any listed colour
    code above any other. This document includes regional information on the colour
    coding of units when different from the fibre code, and of jackets to convey information
    about the types of fibres within, or the types of performance expected. It also
    includes information on colours beyond the basic 12 set out in IEC 60304. This
    document is not a normative document, but, rather, a guide to the subject of colour
    coding of cables.<br />\r\nKeywords: colour coding of optical fibre cables"
