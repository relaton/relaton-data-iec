    <p>ISO/IEC 23005-3:2013 specifies syntax and semantics of description schemes and descriptors that represent sensory information. It is applicable to enhance the experience of users while consuming media resources by stimulating human multi-sensor such as tactile, olfactory, light sense, temperature sense, etc.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23005-3:2013 specifies</p>
    <p>1) Sensory effects description language, including description metadata, declarations, group of effects, effects, reference effects;</p>
    <p>2) Sensory effect vocabulary, including light, flash, temperature, wind, vibration, spraying, scent, fog, color correction, rigid body motion, passive kinesthetic motion, passive kinesthetic force, active kinesthetic, tactile, tactile pattern effect;</p>
    <p>3) Binary format for each tool and the examples.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23005-3:2013 provides interoperability for sensory information between media processing engines. Together with media, the sensory information is rendered by sensory device in a synchronized way based on the user's preference and capabilities of sensory devices which are other parts of ISO/IEC 23005.</p>
