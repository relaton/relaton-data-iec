  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />This Technical Report describes the
    concepts, issues, objectives, and requirements for the design of an active air-flow
    control (AFC) system for commercial aircraft based on a dense deployment of wired
    and wireless sensor and actuator networks. It focuses on the architecture design,
    module definition, statement of objectives, scalability analysis, system-level
    simulation, as well as networking and implementation issues using standardized
    interfaces and service-oriented middleware architectures.
