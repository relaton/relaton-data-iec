abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 29140-2:2011 provides a learner information model specific
    to mobile learning that can be used as a reference by software developers, implementers,
    instructional designers, trainers, automated systems, and learning management
    systems to ensure that learning, education, and training (LET) environments reflect
    the specific needs of mobile participants. Since these needs impact on other standardization
    efforts and other work items in LET, a concise view is necessary.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 29140-2:2011 provides<br />\r\n\ta definition of mobile learning that is appropriate
    for all sectors in LET,<br />\r\n\tthe description of the learner information
    model for mobile learning,<br />\r\n\tspecific learner information that supports
    learners engaged in mobile learning activities in LET environments.<br /><br /><br
    /><br /><br />\r\nIn addition, ISO/IEC TS 29140-2:2011 provides some initial guidance
    regarding the issue of privacy. This includes ensuring that ISO/IEC TS 29140-2:2011
    does not contravene any privacy requirements."
