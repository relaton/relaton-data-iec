abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 80005-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 80005-1:2019
    describes high-voltage shore connection (HVSC) systems, onboard the ship and on
    shore, to supply the ship with electrical power from shore. This document is applicable
    to the design, installation and testing of HVSC systems and addresses:<br />\r\n-
    HV shore distribution systems,<br />\r\n- shore-to-ship connection and interface
    equipment,<br />\r\n- transformers/reactors,<br />\r\n- semiconductor/rotating
    frequency convertors,<br />\r\n- ship distribution systems, and<br />\r\n- control,
    monitoring, interlocking and power management systems.<br />\r\nIt does not apply
    to the electrical power supply during docking periods, for example dry docking
    and other out of service maintenance and repair. Additional and/or alternative
    requirements can be imposed by national administrations or the authorities within
    whose jurisdiction the ship is intended to operate and/or by the owners or authorities
    responsible for a shore supply or distribution system. It is expected that HVSC
    systems will have practicable applications for ships requiring 1 MVA or more or
    ships with HV main supply. Low-voltage shore connection systems are not covered
    by this document. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) modification of 4.1, Figure 1: transformer on ship is optional, earthing
    switches on ship removed;<br />\r\nb) 4.2.2 and new item 11.3: alternative procedure
    of periodic testing added;<br />\r\nc) modification of 4.9:<br />\r\n- minimum
    current value in the safety circuits shall be 50 mA;<br />\r\n- opening of safety
    loop shall cause the automatic opening of ship and shore HVSC circuit breakers
    in a maximum time of 200 ms;<br />\r\nd) modification of 5.2: added Figure on
    harmonic contents;<br />\r\ne) modification of 6.2.3:<br />\r\n– earthing transformer
    with resistor can be used also on the secondary side;<br />\r\n– neutral earthing
    resistor rating in amperes shall be minimum 25 A, 5 s;<br />\r\nf) modification
    of all annexes: the safety circuits shall be mandatory;<br />\r\ng) modification
    of A.2.1: a metallic shield shall be installed at least on the power cores or
    common on pilot wires;<br />\r\nh) modification of B.7.2.1: new safety circuit
    introduced: single line diagram and description;<br />\r\ni) modification of C.4.1:
    SLD for cruise ships was updated, also the safety circuits to be coherent with
    main body, IEC symbols and introduced more details about the control socket-outlets
    and plugs manufacturer type;<br />\r\nj) modification of C.7.3.1:<br />\r\n- shore
    power connector pin assignment is updated;<br />\r\n- all cruise ships shall use
    4 cables in all cases;<br />\r\nk) added D.6.1: the supply point on shore can
    be fixed or movable;<br />\r\nl) modification of D.7.3.2: the voltage used in
    the pilot circuit for container ships shall be less than 60 V DC or 25 V AC.<br
    />\r\nm) added D.8.6 and D.9.3.1: automatic restart and synchronization alternatives;<br
    />\r\nn) Annex E set to informative;<br />\r\no) Annex F set to informative."
