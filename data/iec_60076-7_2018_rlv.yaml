abstract:
- content: "IEC 60076-7:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60076-7:2018
    is applicable to mineral-oil-immersed transformers. It describes the effect of
    operation under various ambient temperatures and load conditions on transformer
    life. This document provides guidance for the specification and loading of power
    transformers from the point of view of operating temperatures and thermal ageing.
    It provides recommendations for loading above the nameplate rating and guidance
    for the planner to choose appropriate rated quantities and loading conditions
    for new installations. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) title has been updated
    from \"oil-immersed power transformers\" to \"mineral-oil-immersed transformers\";<br
    />\r\nb) insulation life is updated by considering latest research findings;<br
    />\r\nc) temperature limits have been reviewed and maximum core temperature is
    recommended;<br />\r\nd) number of fibre optic sensors is recommended for temperature
    rise test;<br />\r\ne) Q, S and H factors are considered;<br />\r\nf) thermal
    models are revised and rewritten in generally applicable mathematical form;<br
    />\r\ng) geomagnetic induced currents are briefly discussed and corresponding
    temperature limits are suggested;<br />\r\nh) extensive literature review has
    been performed and a number of references added to bibliography."
