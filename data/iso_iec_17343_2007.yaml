- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    17343:2007 specifies signalling interworking between QSIG and the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) in support of basic services within a corporate telecommunication
    network (CN) (also known as enterprise network).<br />\r\nQSIG is a signalling
    protocol that operates between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX)
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides circuit-switched
    basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other
    Standards.<br />\r\nNOTE The name QSIG was derived from the fact that it is used
    for signalling at the Q reference point. The Q reference point is a point of demarcation
    between two PINXs.<br />\r\nSIP is an application-layer protocol for establishing,
    terminating, and modifying multimedia sessions. It is typically carried over IP.
    Telephone calls are considered a type of multimedia session where just audio is
    exchanged.<br />\r\nAs the support of telephony within corporate networks evolves
    from circuit-switched technology to Internet technology, the two technologies
    will coexist in many networks for a period, perhaps several years. Therefore,
    there is a need to be able to establish, modify, and terminate sessions involving
    a participant in the SIP network and a participant in the QSIG network. Such calls
    are supported by gateways that perform interworking between SIP and QSIG.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    17343:2007 specifies SIP-QSIG signalling interworking for basic services that
    provide a bi-directional transfer capability for speech, DTMF, facsimile, and
    modem media between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing
    SIP. Other aspects of interworking, e.g., the use of RTP and SDP, will differ
    according to the type of media concerned and are outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    17343:2007.<br />\r\nCall-related and call-independent signalling in support of
    supplementary services is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 17343:2007, but support
    for certain supplementary services (e.g., call transfer, call diversion) could
    be the subject of future work.<br />\r\nInterworking between QSIG and SIP permits
    a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user of a corporate IP
    network, or a call originating at a user of a corporate IP network to terminate
    at a user of a PISN.<br />\r\nInterworking between a PISN employing QSIG and a
    public IP network employing SIP is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 17343:2007. However,
    the functionality specified in ISO/IEC 17343:2007 is in principle applicable to
    such a scenario when deployed in conjunction with other relevant functionality
    (e.g., number translation, security functions, etc.).<br />\r\nISO/IEC 17343:2007
    is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN
    employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP."
