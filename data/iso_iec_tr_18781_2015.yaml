abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 18781:2015 gives guidance on the principles and methods
    of testing ID cards to simulate accidental exposure to conditions encountered
    during the washing and drying of clothing. The physical properties of a card may
    degrade after exposure and the test methods described may be useful for comparing
    different card materials or types.</p><p>Although there are many variations in
    the design and operation of washing machines, the operation of washing, rinsing,
    and water removal is common to all types of machine. For simplicity, one washing
    and drying cycle is specified, which is thought to be typical, according to industry
    sources. Additional wash cycles and/or different temperature conditions can be
    used for comparative purposes if desired.</p>"
