abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 18781:2015 gives guidance on the principles and methods of testing
    ID cards to simulate accidental exposure to conditions encountered during the
    washing and drying of clothing. The physical properties of a card may degrade
    after exposure and the test methods described may be useful for comparing different
    card materials or types.<p>Although there are many variations in the design and
    operation of washing machines, the operation of washing, rinsing, and water removal
    is common to all types of machine. For simplicity, one washing and drying cycle
    is specified, which is thought to be typical, according to industry sources. Additional
    wash cycles and/or different temperature conditions can be used for comparative
    purposes if desired.</p>
