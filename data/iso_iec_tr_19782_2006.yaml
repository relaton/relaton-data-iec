abstract:
- content: "<p>Users of bar code systems have experienced problems with poor read
    rates. These read rate problems can sometimes be attributed to spectral gloss
    from either the substrate or the image or both.</p><p>In many bar code applications,
    the position and orientation of the scanner relative to the bar code symbol can
    be directly controlled by the operator. In these applications, the presentation
    of the bar code symbol to the reader will usually be manipulated by the operator
    to achieve optimal performance. However, in bar code applications using fixed
    position automated reading systems, the ability to control bar code symbol presentation
    to the reader and achieve optimised performance is diminished.</p><p>Due to the
    very high volume of bar code marked items in today's supply chain, even a small
    reduction in read rate can represent significant logistics problems.</p><p>Traditional
    gloss measurements are made at the angle that maximises specular reflection and
    do not provide results that can be used to predict performance at other angles.
    Moreover, many laser scanners use a retro-collective optical system that would
    correspond to a gloss meter using a zero degree angle of incidence, which is not
    commonly available.</p><p>Present international bar code quality standards, such
    as ISO/IEC 15416, do not factor the impact of gloss from either the bar code image
    or substrate into quality grade ratings. Thus a Grade '4' label may be high gloss
    or low gloss. Low gloss labels and images tend to work well in all scanning systems,
    while high gloss labels and images may not. In the absence of industry specifications,
    users have no convenient reference to use when requesting suppliers to provide
    labels that will work well in their systems. ISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 provides a
    method for the measurement of gloss that will permit users to judge if the bar
    code symbol and substrate are suitably matched for the reading system used in
    their application.</p><p>Low opacity of the substrate can degrade system performance
    because it may reduce the apparent contrast of the bar code symbol. ISO/IEC TR
    19782:2006 therefore provides means for measuring the substrate opacity.</p><p>The
    test method described in ISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 provides a means for the production
    of reproducible measurements. In specific applications, it may be necessary to
    correlate these measurements to practical performance. For example, a substrate
    backed by dark liquid may exhibit lower opacity than when measured dry.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 19782:2006 gives guidelines to deal with the effects of substrate gloss and/or
    low opacity on the performance of bar code symbols when scanned by reading and
    verification systems.</p><p>It defines methods of measurement for gloss and opacity;
    it identifies conditions and values that present a risk of reading problems and
    provides recommendations to users on the specification of substrates and the set-up
    of scanning systems to minimize these problems. It also addresses the relationship
    between verification results and read performance when either or both of the factors
    are present.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 19782:2006 is intended for those who specify or
    implement labelling systems and those involved in the reading of bar code symbols
    on packages, components and other carriers of bar code symbols.</p>"
