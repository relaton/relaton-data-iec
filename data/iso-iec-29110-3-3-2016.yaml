    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-3-3:2016 contains the requirements for certification bodies performing conformity assessments, of the requirements contained in VSE profile specifications (e.g. ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 for VSE software basic profile), using process assessments and maturity models. This document is based on published ISO/IEC standards and guides for</p>
    <p>a)    certification bodies (see ISO/IEC 17065)</p>
    <p>b)    the process assessment and organizational process maturity performed according to the requirements of the ISO/IEC 33001 to ISO/IEC 33099 family of process assessment standards, and</p>
    <p>c)    based on ISO/IEC 29169 to support an environment which encourages worldwide recognition of VSE profiles conformity assessment results.</p>
    <p>The overall framework for conformity assessment follows the approach defined in ISO/IEC 17065:2012.</p>
    <p>This document has been developed following practical use and in consultation with key stakeholders, national accreditation bodies, and ISO's policy committee for conformity assessment (CASCO).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-3-3:2016 is addressed to people and certification bodies who have a direct relationship with the assessment process based on the VSE profiles.</p>
    <p>It is intended that ISO/IEC/TR 29110‑1, ISO/IEC 29110‑2-1 and ISO/IEC 29110‑4-1 (containing VSE profile specifications) be read first when investigating the possibility of conducting VSE profile certification.</p>
    <p>NOTE          Any clause with requirements directly copied from other standards has those copied requirements marked up in a box. Other requirements which are also copied but for which information is added are not marked up in a box but their source is clearly referenced in the text.</p>
