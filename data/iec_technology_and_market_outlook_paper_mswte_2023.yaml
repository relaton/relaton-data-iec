abstract:
- content: "Municipal solid waste to energy (MSWtE) refers to the technique of energy
    recovery from municipal solid waste, especially organic waste. The residual energy
    is recovered in the form of various energy products through a variety of technical
    means, such as thermal treatment, thermo-chemical treatment and bio-chemical treatment.<br
    /><br />\r\nMSWtE is a potential technology for achieving sustainable development
    goals in the future. With the continuous development of science and technology,
    MSWtE will play a significant role in solving the problem of growing municipal
    solid waste.<br /><br />\r\nThis technology and market outlook paper (TMOP) summarizes
    the existing technologies and applications of MSWtE, while highlighting the current
    status, challenges and standardization of MSWtE technologies. This paper is dedicated
    to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals and clarifying the role and
    value of IEC International Standards and conformity assessment systems.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis TMOP has been prepared by a project team representing a variety of
    organizations, working under the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB).<br /><br />\r\nThis
    TMOP is available for free download."
