  content: "IEC/TS 60034-18-33:2010 describes procedures for evaluation of insulation
    systems by endurance testing where thermal and electrical stresses are applied
    simultaneously. The procedures are intended for insulation systems used in a.c.
    electrical machines using form-wound windings. The test procedures provide a comparison
    of performance between reference and candidate systems at combinations of voltage
    and temperature which have been used separately to assess quality in the past
    and which are chosen to produce failures within a suitable timescale and at stresses
    within practical limits. The outcome of the test on the candidate insulation system
    will indicate whether it is better or worse than the reference system with proven
    service experience. The main changes of this new edition with respect to the previous
    one are as follows:<br />\r\n- the requirement to investigate the nature of interactions
    between thermal and electrical stresses has been abandoned;<br />\r\n- the use
    of single stress acceleration factors has been removed;<br />\r\n- the selection
    of stress levels has been adjusted and the temperatures are now related to the
    thermal class temperature of the insulation system;<br />\r\n- the introduction
    of end-point criteria;<br />\r\n- a simplified method to display results."
