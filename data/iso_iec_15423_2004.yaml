abstract:
- content: ICO/IEC 15423:2004 defines the test equipment and procedures to be used
    to determine the performance of bar code scanning and decoding equipment. It deals
    with bar code scanning and decoding equipment both as integrated reading systems
    and as discrete units. It defines performance of the equipment in a particular
    configuration (e.g. a specific model) irrespective of the individual components
    used. It also defines in a normative annex operational parameters for the test
    equipment, and describes, in an informative annex, a means of classifying scanners.
