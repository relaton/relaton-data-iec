    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-1:2008:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>   specifies a registration-hierarchical-name-tree (RH-name-tree) which is a generic tree structure for allocations made by a hierarchical structure of Registration Authorities, and the specific form of this that supports the ASN.1 <b>OBJECT IDENTIFIER </b>type and the ASN.1 <b>OID-IRI </b>type (ISO/IEC 8824-1);</li>
    <li>   registers top-level arcs of the international object identifier tree;</li>
    <li>   specifies procedures which are generally applicable to registration in the context of any RH-name-tree;</li>
    <li>   provides guidelines for the establishment and operation of International Registration Authorities for use, when needed, by other ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards;</li>
    <li>   provides guidelines for additional International Standards which choose to reference the procedures in ISO/IEC 9834-1:2008;</li>
    <li>   provides a recommended fee structure for lower-level Registration Authorities;</li>
    <li>   records the information provided to IETF and the registration with IANA of the "oid" IRI scheme.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It does not exclude or disallow the use of any syntactic form of names or naming domains for registration purposes. It is intended to cover those cases where a registration-hierarchical-name is an appropriate form of identification.</p>
    <p>Information about registration for specific objects is contained in separate International Standards.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-1:2008 applies to registration by ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards, by International Registration Authorities and by any other Registration Authority.</p>
