  content: IEC 63150-3:2025 specifies terms and definitions, and test methods of impact-driven
    energy harvesting devices of which electric energy is generated by impact force
    of human walking or running motion under practical human motion. This document
    is applicable to impact-driven energy harvesting devices embedded in wearables,
    especially, shoe-mounted energy harvesters, whose main element of the power generation
    is the impact energy. This measuring method is independent of power generation
    principles (such as piezoelectric, electrostatic, triboelectric, electromagnetic,
    etc.). According to typical human motion, power generation performance is measured
    in the condition of large-amplitude and low-frequency external mechanical excitation.
