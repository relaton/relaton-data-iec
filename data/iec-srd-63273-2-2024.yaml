    among these stakeholders, collecting and analysing use cases of city information
    modelling, scoping out the requirements for city information modelling standards
    and providing recommendations to IEC regarding urban planning and management.<br
    />\r\nThe IEC SRD 63273 part 2: 2024 develops the list of user stories and the
    database of use cases, conducts integrative analyses of the use cases, scopes
    out the requirements of city information modelling standards and provides recommendations
    for IEC and other standards development organizations (SDOs) regarding urban planning
    and management using city information modelling."
