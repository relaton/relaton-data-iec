abstract:
- content: Is a Publicly Available Specification (PAS) giving guidance for the use
    of renewable energies in rural decentralized electrification. Describes the functional
    specifications on which the design, implementation, and exploitation of the constituent
    parts of these electrification systems should be based. Establishes common standards
    for use as a reference in assessing the quality of such systems. IEC PAS 62111
    is in the process of being re-issued in the form of IEC technical specifications
    under reference IEC TS 62257.
