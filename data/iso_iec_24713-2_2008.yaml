abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24713-2:2008 specifies the application profile including necessary
    parameters and interfaces between function modules (i.e. BioAPI based modules
    and an external interface) in support of token-based biometric identification
    and verification of employees, at local access points (i.e. doors or other controlled
    entrances) and across local boundaries within the defined area of control in an
    airport. The token is expected to contain one or more reference biometrics, one
    or more operational biometrics, or both.
