  content: 'IEC/TR 62778:2014 brings clarification and guidance concerning the assessment
    of blue light hazard of all lighting products which have the main emission in
    the visible spectrum (380 nm to 780 nm). By optical and spectral calculations,
    it is shown what the photobiological safety measurements as described in IEC 62471
    tell us about the product and, if this product is intended to be a component in
    a higher level lighting product, how this information can be transferred from
    the component product (e.g. the LED package, the LED module, or the lamp) to the
    higher level lighting product (e.g. the luminaire). This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical change with
    respect to the previous edition: inclusion of the photobiological assessment of
    LED arrays (Annex D). The contents of the corrigendum of July 2014 have been included
    in this copy.'
