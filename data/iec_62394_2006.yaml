abstract:
- content: requirements for service diagnostic software to be implemented in products
    that incorporate a digital interface. It does not specify requirements for carrying
    out remote diagnosis or for manufacturer-dependent software.requires the use of
    a controller (exclusive controller or general-purpose controller/PC) into which
    service diagnostic software can be loaded. Part of this controller software should
    be standardized while another part of this controller software is manufacturer-/product-related.is
    the minimal specification necessary to be able to carry out computerized diagnosis
    and covers the standardized software of the controller as well as the standardized
    software and provisions in the DUT.
