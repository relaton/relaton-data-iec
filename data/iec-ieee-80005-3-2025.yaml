  content: "IEC/IEEE 80005-3:2025 specifies provisions for the design, installation
    and testing of low-voltage shore connection (LVSC) systems, onboard ships and
    on shore, to supply the ship with electrical power from shore.<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to:<br />\r\n- ships requiring up to 1 MVA while at berth;<br />\r\n-
    three-phase shore connection systems rated 250 A and above, and with a nominal
    voltage rating of 400 V AC to 1 000 V AC;<br />\r\n- shore-side connection systems;<br
    />\r\n- shore-to-ship connection and interface equipment;<br />\r\n- transformers
    and reactors;<br />\r\n- semiconductor and rotating frequency convertors;<br />\r\n-
    ship-side connection systems;<br />\r\n- protection, control, monitoring, interlocking
    and power management systems.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to:<br />\r\n-
    inland navigation vessels;<br />\r\n- high-voltage shore connection systems, including
    ships built in accordance with the annexes of IEC/IEEE 80005-1;<br />\r\n- the
    electrical power supply during docking periods, for example dry docking and other
    out-of-service maintenance and repair;<br />\r\n- systems to be operated by ordinary
    persons as defined in 3.19."
