  content: "IEC 63465:2026 specifies the techniques for calibration and usage of pressurised,
    well-type ionisation chambers for activity measurements of radioactive sources.
    Such instruments are used to determine the activity, expressed in becquerel (Bq),
    of photon and some medium to high-energy beta-emitters.<br />\r\nThis document
    addresses calibration procedures of ionisation chambers and radionuclide calibrators
    to be used by equipment manufacturers, national metrology institutes and designated
    institutes, radionuclide producers, suppliers, distributors, and end users, like
    nuclear medicine facilities, industrial or hospital (radio)pharmacies, research
    laboratories, and nuclear power plants.<br />\r\nThis document provides the methods
    and tests for establishing conformity of device acceptability and maintaining
    acceptable instrument performance. Performance benchmarks vary depending on the
    application, so information is given specific to field class instruments for end
    users and reference class instruments for standards laboratories and instrument
    manufacturers.<br />\r\nThe ionisation chamber or radionuclide calibrator can
    be an instrument that is used as a standalone device, but it can also be integrated
    in a much larger appliance, such as a laminar air flow cabinet, a fume hood, a
    hot cell, or a dispensing unit. The instrument can also be equipped with accessories
    that are essential for the intended use of the appliance that surrounds and incorporates
    the radionuclide calibrator. The proper use of each of the accessories can be
    important for the correct use of the radionuclide calibrator and therefore is
    part of the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThe software and computer system(s)
    that can be used to control the radionuclide calibrator hardware and functioning
    are considered an integral part of the device and therefore are also considered
    part of the scope of this document.<br />\r\nIEC 63465:2026 cancels and replaces
    IEC TR 61948-4:2019, IEC 61303:1994, IEC 61145:1992. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to IEC TR 61948-4:2019, IEC 61303:1994 and IEC
    61145:1992:<br />\r\na) technical specifications and quality control procedures
    are updated to apply to modern instruments;<br />\r\nb) test acceptance criteria
    are defined for reference class and field class devices;<br />\r\nc) recommendations
    are given on recording and logging of test data, including the use of control
    charts;<br />\r\nd) specific calibration guidance is included, including guidance
    for subsidiary calibrations with end-user-defined source geometries."
