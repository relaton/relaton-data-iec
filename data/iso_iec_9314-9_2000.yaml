abstract:
- content: 'The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is intended for use in a high-performance
    general purpose multi-station network and is designed for efficient operation
    with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit/s. It uses a Token Ring architecture with optical
    fibre as the primary transmission medium. FDDI provides for hundreds of stations
    operating over an extent of tens of kilometers. The FDDI Part: Token ring low-cost
    fibre physical layer medium dependent standard (LCF-PMD) specifies the lower sublayer
    of the Physical Layer for FDDI. It thus specifies the power levels and characteristics
    of the optical transmitter and receiver, and the interface optical signal requirements
    including jitter. LCF-PMD also specifies the connector receptacle footprint, the
    requirements of conforming FDDI optical fibre cablings, and the permissible bit
    error rates. LCF-PMD is one of a set of alternative international standard PMDs
    for FDDI. This set includes the original PMD, the Single Mode Fibre PMD (SMF-PMD),
    and the Twisted-Pair PMD (TP-PMD).'
