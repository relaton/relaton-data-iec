abstract:
- content: 'The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is intended for use in a high-performance
    general purpose multi-station network and is designed for efficient operation
    with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token Ring architecture with
    optical fibre as the primary transmission medium. FDDI provides for hundreds of
    stations operating over an extent of tens of kilometers. The FDDI Part: Token
    ring low-cost fibre physical layer medium dependent standard (LCF-PMD) specifies
    the lower sublayer of the Physical Layer for FDDI. It thus specifies the power
    levels and characteristics of the optical transmitter and receiver, and the interface
    optical signal requirements including jitter. LCF-PMD also specifies the connector
    receptacle footprint, the requirements of conforming FDDI optical fibre cablings,
    and the permissible bit error rates. LCF-PMD is one of a set of alternative international
    standard PMDs for FDDI. This set includes the original PMD, the Single Mode Fibre
    PMD (SMF-PMD), and the Twisted-Pair PMD (TP-PMD).'
