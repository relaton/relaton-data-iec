  content: "IEC 61523-1:2023 focuses on delay and power calculation for integrated
    circuit design with support for modeling logical behavior and signal integrity.<br
    />\r\nThe standard specifications covered in this document are as follows:<br
    />\r\n- Description language for timing and power modeling, called the “delay
    calculation language” (DCL)<br />\r\n- Software procedural interface (PI) for
    communications between EDA applications and compiled libraries of DCL descriptions<br
    />\r\n- Standard file exchange format for parasitic information about the chip
    design: Standard Parasitic Exchange Format (SPEF)<br />\r\n- Informative usage
    examples<br />\r\n- Informative notes.<br />\r\nThis is an IEC/IEEE dual logo
    standard."
