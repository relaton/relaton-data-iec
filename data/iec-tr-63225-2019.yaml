  content: "IEC TR 63225:2019 highlights the problem of incompatibility of connectors
    for DC-application in photovoltaic systems (DC connectors) produced by different
    manufacturers. It addresses four particular issues in that context:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>background
    information on incompatibility of DC connectors from different manufacturers;</li>\r\n\t<li>observations
    and challenges concerning the handling of DC connectors from different manufacturers;</li>\r\n\t<li>stakeholders
    concerned by the incompatibility of DC connectors;</li>\r\n\t<li>recommendations
    for long-term standardization and interim measures to address incompatibility
    of DC connectors</li>\r\n</ul>"
