abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 provides instruction for naming and identification
    of the following administered items: data element concept, conceptual domain,
    data element, and value domain. It describes the parts and structure of identification.
    Identification is narrowly defined to encompass only the means to establish unique
    identification of these administered items within a register. It describes naming
    in an MDR; includes principles and rules by which naming conventions can be developed;
    and describes example naming conventions. The naming principles and rules described
    in ISO/IEC 11179-5:2005 apply primarily to names of data element concepts, conceptual
    domains, data elements, and value domains.'
