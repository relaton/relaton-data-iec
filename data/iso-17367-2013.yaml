    chain when applied to product tagging. In particular it<br />\r\na) provides specific
    recommendations about the encoded identification of the product,<br />\r\nb) makes
    recommendations about additional information about the product on the RF tag,<br
    />\r\nc) makes recommendations about the semantics and data syntax to be used,<br
    />\r\nd) makes recommendations about the data protocol to be used to interface
    with business applications and the RFID system, and<br />\r\ne) makes recommendations
    about the air interface standards between the RF interrogator and RF tag.<br />\r\nISO
