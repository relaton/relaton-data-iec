  content: "IEC 60287-1-2:2023 provides a method for calculating the eddy current
    losses in the metallic sheaths of single-core cables arranged as a three-phase
    double circuit in flat formation. The sheaths are bonded at one point or are cross-bonded
    so that there are no significant sheath circulating currents. Where metallic sheaths
    are bonded at both ends there are significant circulating currents which result
    in a lower current-carrying capacity. A method of calculating circulating current
    losses for double circuits is provided in IEC 60287-1-3.<br />\r\nThe method descibed
    in this document provides coefficients which are applied as corrections to the
    loss factors for the sheaths of one isolated three-phase circuit. These corrections
    are negligible for cables where the parameter m is less than approximately 0,1
    (m = ω/(Rs · 107)), which corresponds to a sheath longitudinal resistance higher
    than 314 µΩ/m at 50 Hz.<br />\r\nConsequently, the method is used for most sizes
    of aluminium-sheathed cables, but is not required for lead-sheathed cables unless
    they are unusually large.<br />\r\nThe coefficients are provided in tabular form
    and have been computed from fundamental formulae for sheath losses, the evaluation
    of which calls for expertise in computer programming which will possibly not be
    readily available in general commercial situations. The development of simplified
    formulae for some of the tabulated coefficients is under consideration.<br />\r\nLosses
    for cables in a single circuit is covered in IEC 60287-1-1."
