  content: Applies to the electrical and electronic equipment of industrial machines.
    Promotes the safety of persons who come into contact with industrial machines,
    not only from hazards associated with electricity (such as electrical shock and
    fire), but also resulting from malfunction of the electrical equipment itself.
    Addresses hazards associated with the machine and its environment. Replaces the
    second edition of IEC 204-1 as well as parts of IEC 550 and ISO 4336.
