abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60919-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 60919-1:2020(E)
    provides general guidance on the steady-state performance requirements of high-voltage
    direct current (HVDC) systems. It concerns the steady-state performance of two-terminal
    HVDC systems utilizing 12-pulse converter units comprised of three-phase bridge
    (double-way) connections, but it does not cover multiÂ­terminal HVDC transmission
    systems. Both terminals are assumed to use thyristor valves as the main semiconductor
    valves and to have power flow capability in both directions. Diode valves are
    not considered in this document. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Figure 8 and
    Figure 20 have been updated, a new Figure 18 \"LCC/VSC hybrid bipolar system\"
    has been added;<br />\r\n- the HVDC system control objectives have been supplemented;<br
    />\r\n- additional explanations regarding the HVDC system control structure have
    been given;<br />\r\n- a new subclause 13.6 on HVDC system protection has been
    added."
