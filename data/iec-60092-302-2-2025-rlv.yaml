  content: "IEC 60092-302-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60092-302-2:2025
    defines the specific requirements of low voltage marine power switchgear and controlgear
    assemblies (mpsc-assemblies) as follows:<br />\r\n- stationary assemblies with
    enclosure for which the rated voltage does not exceed 1 000 V AC or 1500 V DC;<br
    />\r\n- assemblies intended for use in conjunction with the power generation,
    distribution and conversion of electric energy, and for the control of electric
    energy consuming equipment.<br />\r\nDue to the marine application and the risks
    associated with loss of power, additional safety factors have been applied to
    minimise the risk of failure, such as applying an additional safety factor on
    clearance distances.<br />\r\nThis document applies to all assemblies whether
    they are designed, manufactured and verified on a one-off basis or fully standardised
    and manufactured in quantity.<br />\r\nEither the manufacture or assembly, or
    both, of the MPSC assembly can be carried out by others than the original manufacturer.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to individual devices and self-contained components,
    such as motor starters, fuse switches, electronic equipment, which comply with
    the relevant product standards.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) amended and updated in line with, and correctly
    referenced to the updated clauses of IEC 61439-1:2020 and IEC 61439-2:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) explanation of the need to special consideration for marine applications
    added;<br />\r\nc) Figure 201 updated;<br />\r\nd) adjustment has been made to
    the \"safety factors\" for creepage and clearance distances."
