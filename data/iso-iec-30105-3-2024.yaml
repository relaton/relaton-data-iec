    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies a measurement framework (MF) and an organization maturity model (OMM). It provides the overview of how an organization can use the process reference model (PRM) in ISO/IEC 30105-1 and the process assessment model (PAM) in ISO/IEC 30105-2 to measure their capability and maturity levels. It conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 33003 and ISO/IEC 33004 and supports the performance assessment by providing a framework to measure and derive capability and organization maturity levels.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document is intended to be used in concurrence with the other parts of the ISO/IEC 30105 series and the assessment approach provided by ISO/IEC 33002 for assessing processes.</span></p>
