abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13874:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Path Replacement additional network feature (ANF-PR) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected
    together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>ANF-PR is
    a feature which applies to an established call, allowing that call's connection
    between PINXs to be replaced by a new connection.</p><p>The Q reference point
    is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three
    stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13874:2003
    contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the
    requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13863.</p><p>The
    signalling protocol for ANF-PR operates on top of the signalling protocol for
    basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain
    aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13874:2003 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between ANF-PR and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13874:2003
    is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
