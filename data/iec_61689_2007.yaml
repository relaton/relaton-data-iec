    Is applicable to ultrasonic equipment designed for physiotherapy consisting of an ultrasonic transducer generating continuous or quasi-continuous wave ultrasonic energy in the frequency range 0,5 MHz to 5 MHz.

    This standard only relates to ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment employing a single plane unfocused circular transducer per treatment head, producing static beams perpendicular to the face of the treatment head.

    This standard specifies:

    - methods of measurement and characterization of the output of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based on reference testing methods;

    - characteristics to be specified by manufacturers of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based on reference testing methods;

    - guidelines for safety of the ultrasonic field generated by ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment;

    - methods of measurement and characterization of the output of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based on routine testing methods;

    - acceptance criteria for aspects of the output of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based on routine testing methods.

    Therapeutic value and methods of use of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment are not covered by the scope of this standard.

    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1996 and constitutes a technical revision.

    This second edition is a result of maintenance on this standard and the referenced standards IEC 61161 (2006) and IEC 62127-1. A relatively large technical change is the determination of the effective radiating area. This is now no longer based on the measurement of four areas but only on one. This change was needed to improve the accuracy of the determination of this parameter for small transducers. Be aware that this change may alter the value obtained for this and related parameters.
