abstract:
- content: 'This Technical Report deals with statistical considerations in the determination
    of EMC compliance of mass-produced products. The reasons for such statistical
    considerations are: a) that the abatement of interference aims that the majority
    of the appliances to be approved shall not cause interference; b) that the CISPR
    limits should be suitable for the purpose of type approval of mass-produced appliances
    as well as approval of single-produced appliances; c that to ensure compliance
    of mass-produced appliances with the CISPR limits, statistical techniques have
    to be applied; d) that it is important for international trade that the limits
    shall be interpreted in the same way in every country; e) that the National Committees
    of the IEC which collaborate in the work of the CISPR should seek to secure the
    agreement of the competent authorities in their countries. Therefore, this part
    of CISPR 16 specifies requirements and provides guidance based on statistical
    techniques. EMC compliance of mass-produced appliances should be based on the
    application of statistical techniques that must reassure the consumer, with an
    80 % degree of confidence, that 80 % of the appliances of a type being investigated
    comply with the emission or immunity requirements.<strong>This consolidated version
    consists of the second edition (2004) and its amendment 1 (2006). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>'
