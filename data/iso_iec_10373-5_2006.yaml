abstract:
- content: ISO 10373 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards
    as defined in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross-referenced to one or more
    base standards, which may be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary
    standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification
    cards applications.Criteria for acceptability do not form part of ISO 10373 but
    will be found in the International Standards mentioned above.Test methods defined
    in ISO 10373 are intended to be performed separately. A given card is not required
    to pass through all the tests sequentially.ISO 10373-1 deals with test methods
    which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts deal with other
    technology-specific tests.ISO 10373-5:2006 deals with test methods which are specific
    to optical memory card technology.
