abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62607-4-2:2016(E), which is a Technical Specification, provides
    a standardized method for the determination of the density of cathode nanomaterials
    in powder form used for electrical energy storage devices. This method provides
    users with a key control characteristic to decide whether or not a cathode nanomaterial
    is usable, or suitable for their application. This document includes definitions
    of terminology used in this document, recommendations for sample preparation,
    outlines of the experimental procedures used to measure cathode nanomaterial properties,
    methods of interpretation of results and discussion of data analysis, case studies,
    and references.
