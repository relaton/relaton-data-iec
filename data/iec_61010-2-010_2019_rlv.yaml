    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 61010-2-010:2019
    specifies particular safety requirements for the following types a) to c) of electrical
    equipment and their accessories, wherever they are intended to be used, whenever
    the heating of materials is one of the functions of the equipment.<br />\r\na)
    Electrical test and measurement equipment<br />\r\nThis is equipment which by
    electromagnetic means tests, measures, indicates or records<br />\r\none or more
    electrical or physical quantities, also non-measuring equipment such as<br />\r\nsignal
    generators, measurement standards, power supplies for laboratory use,<br />\r\ntransducers,
    transmitters, etc.<br />\r\nb) Electrical industrial process-control equipment<br
    />\r\nThis is equipment which controls one or more output quantities to specific
    values, with<br />\r\neach value determined by manual setting, by local or remote
    programming, or by one or<br />\r\nmore input variables.<br />\r\nc) Electrical
    laboratory equipment<br />\r\nThis is equipment which measures, indicates, monitors,
    inspects or analyses materials, or<br />\r\nis used to prepare materials, and
    includes in vitro diagnostic (IVD) equipment. This fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with changes introduced
