abstract:
- content: IEC 62396-3:2013(E) provides guidance and furthermore it provides necessary
    requirements for those involved in the design of avionic systems and equipment
    and the resultant effects of atmospheric radiation-induced single event effects
    (SEE) on those avionic systems. The outputs of the activities and objectives described
    in this part of IEC 62396 will become inputs to higher level certification activities
    and required evidences. It builds on the initial guidance on the system level
    approach to single event effects in IEC 62396-1:2012, considers some avionic systems
    and provides basic methods to accommodate SEE so that system development assurance
    levels are met.
