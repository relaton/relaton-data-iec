abstract:
- content: specifies the requirements for the interface between the Home Network Lower
    Layer for a country's home network of standalone-type household appliances and
    the TCP/IP Layer for cases where it is intended to introduce a TCP/IP Layer to
    each of the nodes comprising such home network of standalone-type household appliances.
    The specified interface in the Home Network Lower Layer consists of 2 portions,
    the TCP/IP Interface and the lower medium-specific Interface. Figure 3 shows the
    composition of the Home Network Layer and the standardized portions. In Annex
    C, this standard specifies the requirements for the lower medium-specific Interface
    One of these layers shall be IEEE 802.15.1, short-distance radio standard additional
    layers can be added in the future).
