abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 23026:2023 This document defines system engineering and management
    requirements for the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering,
    testing and validation, and management and sustainment for intranet and extranet
    environments. This document applies to those using web technology to present information
    and communications technology (ICT) information, such as information for users
    of systems and services, plans and reports for systems and software engineering
    projects, and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service
    management. This document provides requirements for website owners and website
    providers, managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development
    and operations, website engineers, designers, developers, and operations and maintenance
    staff, who can be external or internal to the website owner's organization. It
    applies to websites for public access and for limited access, such as for users,
    customers, and subscribers seeking information on IT systems, products and services.<br
    />\r\nThe requirements and recommendations in this document address the following
    aspects of usability of informational websites and ease of maintenance of managed
    website operations:<br />\r\na) locating relevant and timely information;<br />\r\nb)
    applying information security management;<br />\r\nc) facilitating accessibility
    and ease of use;<br />\r\nd) providing for consistent and efficient development
    and maintenance practices.<br />\r\nThis document is not particularly applicable
    to websites used primarily for marketing or sales, to deliver instructional material
    (tutorials), or to provide graphical user interfaces (GUI) for business or consumer
    transactional application processing. However, this document can provide useful
    insights for managing such sites.<br />\r\nThis document does not address vendor
    and product considerations for website engineering and management. This document
    does not include specifications for application development tools, programming
    and scripting languages used for websites, metadata tags, or protocols for network
    communications. It does not address tools or systems used for management or storage
    of information content (data, documents) that can be presented on websites.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not address the design and architecture of software and
    systems supporting the Internet."
