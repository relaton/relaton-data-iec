abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines system engineering and management
    requirements for the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering,
    testing and validation, and management and sustainment for intranet and extranet
    environments. This document applies to those using web technology to present information
    and communications technology (ICT) information, such as information for users
    of systems and services, plans and reports for systems and software engineering
    projects, and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service
    management. This document provides requirements for website owners and website
    providers, managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development
    and operations, website engineers, designers, developers, and operations and maintenance
    staff, who can be external or internal to the website owner''s organization. It
    applies to websites for public access and for limited access, such as for users,
    customers, and subscribers seeking information on IT systems, products and services.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">The requirements and recommendations in this document address
    the following aspects of usability of informational websites and ease of maintenance
    of managed website operations:</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l0 level1
    lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->a)<!--[endif]-->locating relevant and timely information;</p><p
    class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->b)<!--[endif]-->applying
    information security management;</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l0
    level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->c)<!--[endif]-->facilitating accessibility
    and ease of use;</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!--
    [if!supportLists]-->d)<!--[endif]-->providing for consistent and efficient development
    and maintenance practices.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document is not particularly
    applicable to websites used primarily for marketing or sales, to deliver instructional
    material (tutorials), or to provide graphical user interfaces (GUI) for business
    or consumer transactional application processing. However, this document can provide
    useful insights for managing such sites.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    does not address vendor and product considerations for website engineering and
    management. This document does not include specifications for application development
    tools, programming and scripting languages used for websites, metadata tags, or
    protocols for network communications. It does not address tools or systems used
    for management or storage of information content (data, documents) that can be
    presented on websites.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document does not address
    the design and architecture of software and systems supporting the Internet.</p>'
