abstract:
- content: "This document specifies methods for generating and testing prime numbers
    as required in cryptographic protocols and algorithms.<br />\r\nFirstly, this
    document specifies methods for testing whether a given number is prime. The testing
    methods included in this document are divided into two groups:<br />\r\n- probabilistic
    primality tests, which have a small error probability. All probabilistic tests
    described here can declare a composite to be a prime;<br />\r\n- deterministic
    methods, which are guaranteed to give the right verdict. These methods use so-called
    primality certificates.<br />\r\nSecondly, this document specifies methods to
    generate prime numbers. Again, both probabilistic and deterministic methods are
    presented.<br />\r\nNOTE It is possible that readers with a background in algorithm
    theory have already had previous encounters with probabilistic and deterministic
    algorithms. The deterministic methods in this document internally still make use
    of random bits (to be generated via methods described in ISO/IEC 18031), and \"deterministic\"
    only refers to the fact that the output is correct with probability one.<br />\r\nAnnex
    A provides error probabilities that are utilized by the Miller-Rabin primality
    test.<br />\r\nAnnex B describes variants of the methods for generating primes
    so that particular cryptographic requirements can be met.<br />\r\nAnnex C defines
    primitives utilized by the prime generation and verification methods."
