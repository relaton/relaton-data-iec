abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 9834-1:2008: specifies a registration-hierarchical-name-tree (RH-name-tree)
    which is a generic tree structure for allocations made by a hierarchical structure
    of Registration Authorities, and the specific form of this that supports the ASN.1
    OBJECT IDENTIFIER type and the ASN.1 OID-IRI type (ISO/IEC 8824-1); registers
    top-level arcs of the international object identifier tree; specifies procedures
    which are generally applicable to registration in the context of any RH-name-tree;
    provides guidelines for the establishment and operation of International Registration
    Authorities for use, when needed, by other ITU-T Recommendations and/or International
    Standards; provides guidelines for additional International Standards which choose
    to reference the procedures in ISO/IEC 9834-1:2008; provides a recommended fee
    structure for lower-level Registration Authorities; records the information provided
    to IETF and the registration with IANA of the "oid" IRI scheme.It does not exclude
    or disallow the use of any syntactic form of names or naming domains for registration
    purposes. It is intended to cover those cases where a registration-hierarchical-name
    is an appropriate form of identification.Information about registration for specific
    objects is contained in separate International Standards.ISO/IEC 9834-1:2008 applies
    to registration by ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards, by International
    Registration Authorities and by any other Registration Authority.'
