  content: IEC 63098-4:2023 provides the performance standards of the RoF-based 5G
    indoor distributed antenna system (DAS) network for cost-effectively offering
    quality of service (QoS) guaranteed 5G mobile communication services with high
    bandwidth and low-latency characteristics without radio shadowing in an indoor
    environment. First of all, the system overview, system configurations, and the
    elements of the system are presented and then the electrical and optical interfaces
    for each system element are defined. Finally, the detail system performance specifications
    of each element are described for downlink and uplink configurations.
