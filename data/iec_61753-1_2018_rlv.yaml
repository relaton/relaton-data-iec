abstract:
- content: "IEC 61753-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61753-1:2018
    provides guidance for the drafting of performance standards for all passive fibre
    optic products. This document defines the tests and severities which form the
    performance categories or general operating service environments and identifies
    those tests which are considered to be product specific. Test and severity details
    are given in Annex A. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2007. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) definitions updated with new products: wall outlets, wall or pole mounted
    boxes, splices, ODF modules, street cabinets, hardened connectors and field mountable
    connectors;<br />\r\nb) categories U and O are replaced by categories OP and OP+.
    No mandatory sequence in category OP+. Category OP+ contains the tests from category
    OP with the addition of only 4 other tests;<br />\r\nc) addition of Category I
    (Industrial);<br />\r\nd) temperature ranges added (with the HD suffix to the
    categories C, OP, OP+ and I) in case passive optical components are placed in
    a housing together with active electronics (HD stands for “heat dissipation”);<br
    />\r\ne) the height of category A changed from 3 m to ground level (0 m);<br />\r\nf)
    the lower level height of category G environment changed from ground level (0
    m) to –1 m below ground level. Upper level remains at 3 m above ground level;<br
    />\r\ng) addition of performance tests, test severities and performance criteria
    for new products: Wall outlet, wall or pole mounted boxes, mechanical splices,
    fusion splice protectors, ODF modules, street cabinets, field mountable connectors
    and hardened optical connectors;<br />\r\nh) test severity of \"Mating durability\"
    test for connectors in categories C, OP,OP+ and I is reduced to 200 cycles for
    connectors with cylindrical ferrules and 50 cycles for connectors with rectangular
    ferrules;<br />\r\ni) test severity of \"Change of temperature\" test for connectors
    and passive optical components in category I is reduced from 20 cycles to 12 cycles
    (harmonized with connectors and components from other categories);<br />\r\nj)
    test severity of \"Flexing of strain relief\" test for connectors in categories
    C, OP and OP+ is reduced to 50 cycles;<br />\r\nk) test severities of \"Assembly
    and disassembly of fibre optic mechanical splices, fibre management systems and
    closures\" test for all enclosures is reduced to 5 cycles;<br />\r\nl) test severities
    of \"Change of temperature\" test for all protective housings in categories C,
    A, G and S is reduced from 20 cycles to 12 cycles (harmonized with connectors
    and components);<br />\r\nm) test severities of \"Resistance to solvents and contaminating
    fluids\" test for closures in categories G and S changed – kerosene is removed,
    diesel oil exposure reduced to 1 h immersion and 24 h drying at room temperature;<br
    />\r\nn) sealing performance criteria of sealed closures for categories G and
    A are reduced to 20 kPa overpressure.<br />\r\no) the change in attenuation criterion
    for connectors has changed from peak-to-peak into a +/- deviation from the original
    value of the transmitted power at the start of the test (harmonized with the change
    in attenuation criterion for components, splices and protective housings).<br
    />\r\nKeywords: performance standards for all passive fibre optic products<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of May 2019 have been included in this copy."
