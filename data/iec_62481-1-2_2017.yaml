abstract:
- content: IEC 62481-1-2:2017 introduces a number of device classes to identify specific
    roles that connected endpoints implement in the network. Devices can act as content
    sources (e.g., Digital Media Servers, Push Controllers), and as content sinks
    (Digital Media Renderers or Digital Media Players). This document addresses this
    issue and, specifically, it describes a device class for an Extended Digital Media
    Renderer (XDMR) and implementation guidelines for combining a Digital Media Renderer
    and a UPnP Media Server Control Point.
