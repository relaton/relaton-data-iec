    <p>ISO/IEC 10373 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which may be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10373-7:2008 deals with test methods, which are specific to contactless integrated circuit card (vicinity card) technology. ISO/IEC 10373-1 deals with test methods which are common to one or more ICC technologies and other parts deal with other technology‑specific tests. </p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 10373-7:2008 apply exclusively to vicinity cards defined in ISO/IEC 15693‑1 and ISO/IEC 15693-2.</p>
