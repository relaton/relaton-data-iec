  content: IEC 62319-1:2005(E) prescribes terms and methods of test for polymeric
    positive temperature coefficient thermistors, insulated and non-insulated types,
    typically intended for use in current limiting and overcurrent protection applications.
    It establishes standard terms, inspection procedures and methods of test for use
    in detail specifications for Qualification Approval and for Quality Assessment
    Systems for electronic components. The contents of the corrigendum of March 2009
    have been included in this copy.
