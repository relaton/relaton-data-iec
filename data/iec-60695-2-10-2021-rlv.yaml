  content: "IEC 60695-2-10:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60695-2-10:2021
    specifies the glow-wire apparatus and common test procedure to simulate the effects
    of thermal stresses which may be produced by heat sources such as glowing elements
    or overloaded resistors, for short periods, in order to assess the fire hazard
    by a simulation technique. The test procedure described in this document is a
    common test procedure intended for the small-scale tests in which a standardized
    electrically heated wire is used as a source of ignition. It is a common part
    of the test procedures applied to end products and to solid electrical insulating
    materials or other solid combustible materials. A detailed description of each
    particular test procedure is given in IEC 60695-2-11, IEC 60695-2-12 and IEC 60695-2-13.
    This basic safety publication focusing on safety test method(s) is primarily intended
    for use by technical committees in the preparation of safety publications in accordance
    with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. One of the
    responsibilities of a technical committee is, wherever applicable, to make use
    of basic safety publications in the preparation of its publications. This standard
    is to be used in conjunction with IEC 60695-2-11, IEC 60695-2-12, and IEC 60695-2-13.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2013.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    New terms and definitions with regards to times and durations have been added
    to Clause 3.<br />\r\nb) Previous Annex A of Equipment manufacturers and suppliers
    has been deleted.<br />\r\nc) Annex A (previous Annex B) for ignition and flaming
    observations has been changed from informative to normative.<br />\r\nd) New Annex
    C has been added, which visualizes times and durations, and gives examples for
    the behaviour of specimens, and how to evaluate them.<br />\r\nThe contents of
    the corrigendum of January 2024 have been included in this copy."
