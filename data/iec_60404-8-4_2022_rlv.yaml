abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-8-4:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60404-8-4:2022
    defines the grades of cold-rolled non-oriented electrical steel strip and sheet
    in nominal thicknesses of 0,35 mm, 0,47 mm, 0,50 mm, 0,65 mm and 1,00 mm. In particular,
    it gives general requirements, magnetic properties, geometric characteristics,
    tolerances and technological characteristics, as well as inspection procedure.
    The nominal thickness 0,47 mm applies to the grades for use at 60 Hz only. This
    document applies to cold-rolled non-oriented electrical steel strip and sheet
    supplied in the fully-processed state, i.e. the final annealed condition, in coils
    or sheets, and intended for the construction of magnetic circuits. This document
    does not apply to materials supplied in the semi-processed state. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- modification of terms and technical requirements concerning
    geometrical characteristics to be consistent with IEC 60404-9:2018;<br />\r\n-
    insertion of Table 3 - Tolerances on nominal thickness;<br />\r\n- change of the
    length of test specimen for determination of geometrical characteristics from
    2 m to 1 m."
