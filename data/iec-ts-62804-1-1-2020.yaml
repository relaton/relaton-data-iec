- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: IEC 62804-1-1:2020 defines procedures to test and evaluate for potential-induced
    degradation-delamination (PID-d) mode in the laminate of crystalline silicon PV
    modules-principally those with one or two glass faces. This document evaluates
    delamination attributable to current transfer between ground and the module cell
    circuit. Elements driving the delamination that this test is designed to actuate
    include reduced adhesion associated with damp heat exposure, sodium accumulation
    at interfaces, and cathodic gas evolution in the cell circuit, metallization,
    and other components within the PV module activated by the voltage potential.
    The change in power of crystalline silicon PV modules associated with the stress
    factors applied (the purview of IEC TS 62804-1) is not considered in the scope.
