abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 18044:2004 provides advice and guidance on information security
    incident management for information security managers and for information system
    managers. ISO/IEC TR 18044:2004 provides information on the benefits to be obtained
    from and the key issues associated with a good information security incident management
    approach (to convince senior corporate management and those personnel who will
    report to and receive feedback from a scheme that the scheme should be introduced
    and used); information on examples of information security incidents, and an insight
    into their possible causes;a description of the planning and documentation required
    to introduce a good structured information security incident management approach;
    a description of the information security incident management process*. * Quick,
    co-ordinated and effective responses to an information security incident require
    extensive technical and procedural preparations. Information security incident
    responses may consist of immediate, short- and long-term actions. Any actions
    undertaken as the response to an incident should be based on previously developed,
    documented and accepted security incident response procedures and processes, including
    those for post-response analysis.
