abstract:
- content: |-
    In the present amendment to CISPR 16-3, experimental results show a relationship between the degradation in quality of digital communication systems and APD (amplitude probability distribution) characteristics of disturbance.

    These results show that APD measurement of disturbance is suitable for evaluating its interference potential on digital communication systems. Therefore APD measurement may be applicable to the compliance test of some products or product families, such as microwave ovens.
