    <p>ISO/IEC 24779-9:2015 specifies the symbols and icons to be used in conjunction with vascular image recognition.</p>
    <p>It specifies a family of symbols and icons used in association with devices for biometric enrolment, verification, and/or identification. Icons are for display on visual display screens. Symbols are printed on signs and printed documents including user documents, hand outs, training material, installation/maintenance manuals, and on case or key tops and buttons of devices.</p>
    <p>The symbols and icons are intended to show the modality of biometrics and to advise the necessity of appropriate preparation and the behaviour required in order to use the biometric systems. T ISO/IEC 24779-9:2015 focuses on communication with the data capture subject. Operators could use ISO/IEC 24779-9:2015 but they might need additional symbols and information.</p>
