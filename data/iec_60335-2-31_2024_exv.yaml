abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-31:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-31:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-31:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric range hoods and other cooking fume extractors intended for installing
    above, beside, behind or under household cooking ranges, hobs and similar cooking
    appliances, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances. The cooking appliance can be supplied by electricity
    or other fuels, such as gas. Appliances not intended for normal household use
    but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances incorporating
    electrostatic air filters, IEC 60335-2-65 also applies;<br />\r\n- for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national authorities responsible for buildings and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended
    for commercial purposes (IEC 60335-2-99);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be
    used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a
    corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis sixth edition
    cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2012, Amendment 1:2016 and
    Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 22.8, 22.101, 22.102);<br />\r\nc)
    update of the installation requirements for the heating test to include down-draft
    systems (11.2);<br />\r\nd) addition of accessible surface temperature limits
    (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ne) introduction of IEC TR 62854 to determine compliance
    in case of doubt (22.14);<br />\r\nf) clarification of remote operation requirements
    for range hoods and other cooking fume extraction appliances (22.40, 22.49, 22.51);<br
    />\r\ng) clarification of 30.101 with respect to grease filters and odour extraction
    filters.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
