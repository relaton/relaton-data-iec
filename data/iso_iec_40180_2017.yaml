abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 40180 provides the fundamentals and the reference framework
    for quality assurance, quality management and quality improvement in IT-enhanced
    learning, education and training (called E-Learning). It consists mainly of the
    Quality Reference Framework (QRF) for E-Learning, which is a common and generic
    framework to describe, specify and understand critical properties, characteristics
    and metrics of quality. The QRF combines an elaborated and extensive process model
    with a descriptive model for the processes. ISO/IEC 40180 harmonizes existing
    approaches, concepts, specifications, terms and definitions related to quality
    for E-Learning, education and training.</p>"
