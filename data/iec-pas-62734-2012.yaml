  content: IEC/PAS 62734:2012(E) defines the OSI layer specifications (e.g., PhL,
    DL, etc.), security specifications, and management (including network and device
    configuration) specifications for wireless devices serving application classes
    1 through 5 and optionally class 0 for fixed, portable, and moving devices. It
    addresses the performance needs for periodic monitoring and process control where
    latencies on the order of 100 ms can be tolerated, with optional behavior for
    shorter latency.
