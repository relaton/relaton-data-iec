abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-45:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-45:2017
    establishes uniform requirements for measuring the mode field diameter (MFD) of
    single-mode optical fibre, thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables
    for commercial purposes.  This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2001. This edition constitutes a technical revision.  This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- improvement of the description of measurement details for
    B6 fibre;<br />\r\n- correction of Equations (1), (2), (5) and (6);<br />\r\n-
    correction of Table E.1, Table E.2 and Table E.3.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords: mode
    field diameter (MFD)"
