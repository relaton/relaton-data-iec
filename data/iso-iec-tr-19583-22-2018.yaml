    <p>This document provides a usage scenario that utilizes the facilities defined in ISO/IEC 11179-3, ISO/IEC 19763-5 and ISO/IEC 19763-10 to demonstrate the registration of the mapping between process models. The availability of these registered process model mappings will help to promote the reuse of process models.</p>
    <p>The scope of this document is limited to a discussion of the process models associated with software development projects and the deliverables produced during these projects. </p>
    <p>This document describes a scenario that evaluates the combined usage of ISO/IEC 11179-3, ISO/IEC 19763-5 and ISO/IEC 19763-10 to enable the reuse of past knowledge of process models describing project processes and deliverables.</p>
