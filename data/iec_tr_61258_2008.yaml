abstract:
- content: IEC&#x2F;TR 61258:2008(E), which is a technical report, outlines a generic
    process for developing materials for education and training of operators of medical
    electrical equipment or a medical electrical system, hereafter referred to collectively
    as equipment. It can be used by standards organizations, manufacturers, health
    care facility managers, clinical engineers, physician and nurse educators, and
    others involved directly or indirectly in education and training of operators.
    In particular, manufacturers might find this process useful in preparing the necessary
    markings, accompanying documents and other educational materials which will provide
    necessary information to operators of the equipment and encourage them to employ
    safe and effective practices. This technical report is not intended to be used
    for regulatory purposes. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 1994. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    has been aligned with IEC 60601-1:2005 to include medical electrical systems within
    its scope. Usability engineering concepts from IEC 62366:2007 have also been added
    to this edition.
