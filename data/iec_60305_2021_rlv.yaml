abstract:
- content: "IEC 60305:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60305:2021 applies to string
    insulator units of the cap and pin type with insulating parts of ceramic material
    or glass, intended for AC overhead lines with a nominal voltage greater than 1
    000 V and a frequency not greater than 100 Hz. It also applies to insulators of
    similar design used in substations. This document applies to string insulator
    units of the cap and pin type either with ball and socket couplings or with clevis
    and tongue couplings. This document applies to string insulator units for use
    on overhead lines in clean areas and polluted areas. For use in areas characterized
    by very heavy pollution levels and for other particular or extreme environmental
    conditions, it may be necessary for certain dimensions to be changed and insulator
    units having different creepage distances, spacing and forms may be preferred
    (for example, flat profile, hemispherical etc.). Insulators for use on DC systems
    may also need different dimensions. In any case, it is applicable that the standardized
    mechanical characteristics of this document and coupling sizes are retained. This
    fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 1995. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- wording in Scope changed from \"it is recommended\"
    to \"it is applicable\";<br />\r\n- new normative references added;<br />\r\n-
    electromechanical or mechanical failing load in Clause 4 specified;<br />\r\n-
    new figures added showing profiles.</p>"
