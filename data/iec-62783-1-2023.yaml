  content: "IEC 62783-1:2023 specifies definitions, requirements and test methods
    of twinax cables used in digital communication systems: computer rooms, data centres,
    servers, etc. These cables are intended to be used indoors.<br />\r\nThis document
    details the requirements and transmission characteristics for single twinax elements
    as well as multiple twinax elements within the same sheath, i.e. “twinax cable”.
    IEC 62783-1 ED2 is applicable to twinax cables and also twinax cable assemblies.
    This document is supplemented with family specifications that give additional
    requirements based on the specific application, for example, the minimum and maximum
    specified frequency of the cables."
