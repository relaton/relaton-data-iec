abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 74:2004 gives procedures for the development of graphical
    symbols for public information, use in safety signs and product safety labels,
    and use on equipment and products.<br /><br />\r\nSuch graphical symbols can be
    included in consumer documentation.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 74:2004 does
    not cover road traffic signs and graphical symbols for use in technical documentation.<br
    /><br />\r\nRules for the design of graphical symbols are given in International
    Standards. ISO/IEC Guide 74:2004 brings together information on relevant international
    reference documents and standards to assist technical committees and designers
    to follow best practice when considering the need for a new graphical symbol.<br
    /><br />\r\nIMPORTANT -- The colours represented in the electronic file of ISO/IEC
    Guide 74:2004 can be neither viewed on screen nor printed as true representations.
    Although the copies of ISO/IEC Guide 74:2004 printed by ISO have been produced
    to correspond (with an acceptable tolerance as judged by the naked eye) to the
    requirements of ISO 3864-1, it is not intended that these printed copies be used
    for colour matching. Instead, consult ISO 3864-1 which provides colorimetric and
    photometric properties together with, as a guideline, references from colour order
    systems."
