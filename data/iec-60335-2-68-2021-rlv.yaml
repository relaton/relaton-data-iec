  content: "IEC 60335-2-68:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-68:2021
    deals with the safety of electrical portable, non-self-propelled motor-operated
    spray extraction machines with or without attachments and with or without electrical
    heating elements, intended for commercial indoor use. This standard applies to
    machines for commercial use. The following list, although not comprehensive, gives
    an indication of locations that are included in the scope:<br />\r\n- public use
    areas such as hotels, schools, hospitals;<br />\r\n- industrial locations, for
    example factories and manufacturing shops;<br />\r\n- retail outlets, for example
    shops and supermarkets;<br />\r\n- business premises, for example offices and
    banks;<br />\r\n- rental services for those machines;<br />\r\n- all uses other
    than normal housekeeping purposes.<br />\r\nThese machines are not equipped with
    a traction drive. Machines for the same intended function but equipped with a
    traction drive are covered by IEC 60335-2-72.<br />\r\nThe following power systems
    are covered:<br />\r\n- mains powered motors up to a rated voltage of 250 V for
    single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances,<br />\r\n- battery-operated
    machines.<br />\r\nThis standard applies to machines in which the pressure of
    the employed cleaning agent does not exceed 2,5 MPa, and in which the product
    of the pressure (in MPa) and the flow of cleaning agent (in litres per minute)
    does not exceed 100, and in which the temperature of the cleaning agent at the
    spray nozzle outlet does not exceed 85 °C.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to<br />\r\n- vacuum cleaners and water-suction cleaning appliances for household
    use (IEC 60335-2-2);<br />\r\n- floor treatment machines for commercial use (IEC
    60335-2-67, IEC 60335-2-72);<br />\r\n- wet and dry vacuum cleaners, including
    power brush, for commercial use (IEC 60335-2-69);<br />\r\n- hand-held and transportable
    motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745 series, IEC 61029 series, IEC 62841 series).<br
    />\r\n- machines designed for use in corrosive or explosive environments (dust,
    vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- machines designed for picking up hazardous dusts (as
    defined in IEC 60335-2-69), inflammable substances, or glowing particles;<br />\r\n-
    machines designed to handle hazardous solvents, such as flammable or explosive
    liquids;<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published
    in 2012 and its Amendment 1: 2016. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\n- editorial and technical alignment
    with IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
