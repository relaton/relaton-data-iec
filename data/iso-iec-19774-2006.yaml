    <p>ISO/IEC 19774:2006, specifies a systematic method for representing humanoids in a network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia environment. Conceptually, each humanoid is an articulated character that can be embedded in different representation systems and animated using the facilities provided by the representation system. ISO/IEC 19774:2006 specifies the abstract form and structure of humanoids.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19774:2006 is intended for a wide variety of presentation systems and application, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation of the functionality.</p>
