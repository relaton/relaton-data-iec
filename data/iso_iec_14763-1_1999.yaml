    An
    effective cabling system is one that is properly installed, maintained and updated. In order to
    maintain and update a cabling system in an efficient manner, an adequate administration
    system is required.
    An administration system consists of records that document the location of all
    telecommunications components and the unique identifiers that have been assigned to those
    components. It details the procedures for assigning identifiers to the components
    and placing labels on the components. The administration system provides a structure
    wherein additions, changes and deletions can be easily incorporated into the administration
    documentation.
