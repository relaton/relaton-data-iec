  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-16:2021(E) which is a technical report, specifies the
    mechanisms for the system management of Smart Grid Devices as IEC 61850 equipment
    in power utility automation as well as telecommunication and cybersecurity equipment.<br
    />\r\nSystem Management of Smart Grid Devices or Smart Grid Device Management
    refers to functionalities that are not directly linked to the operational role
    of the equipment (which for grid automation equipment would be to protect and
    allow remote supervision and control on the grid) but allow it to perform its
    operational functions in the best conditions possible.<br />\r\nThe main functions
    of Smart Grid Device Management can be categorized as illustrated in Figure 1
    and described below. These actions being available from remote information systems,
    they affect system automation functions, telecommunication functions and cybersecurity
    functions as these three categories are interacting in a Smart grid Device or
    system.<br />\r\nThe Smart Grid domain has been chosen for these use cases, including
    distributed energy resources. This content is expected to be applicable to other
    domains, such as industrial automation domain and grid user domain."
