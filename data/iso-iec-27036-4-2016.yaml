    <p>ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 provides cloud service customers and cloud service providers with guidance on</p>
    <p>a)    gaining visibility into the information security risks associated with the use of cloud services and managing those risks effectively, and</p>
    <p>b)    responding to risks specific to the acquisition or provision of cloud services that can have an information security impact on organizations using these services.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 does not include business continuity management/resiliency issues involved with the cloud service. ISO/IEC 27031 addresses business continuity.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 does not provide guidance on how a cloud service provider should implement, manage and operate information security. Guidance on those can be found in ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27017.</p>
    <p>The scope of ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 is to define guidelines supporting the implementation of information security management for the use of cloud services.</p>
