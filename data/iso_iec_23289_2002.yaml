abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23289:2002 specifies signalling interworking between "QSIG" and
    "H.323" in support of basic services within a corporate telecommunication network
    (CN).   "QSIG" is a signalling protocol that operates at the Q reference point
    between Private Integrated services Network eXchange (PINX) within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN). The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.
    A PISN provides circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to
    its users. QSIG is specified in other International Standards, in particular ISO/IEC
    11572 (call control in support of basic services).   "H.323" is a set of signalling
    protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication within a packet
    network, in particular a packet network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as
    its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling protocols operate between
    endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more gatekeepers, or
    directly. An endpoint can be a terminal or a gateway to another network. H.323
    is an "umbrella" recommendation referring to various ITU-T recommendations, in
    particular recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities).   ISO/IEC
    23289:2002 specifies signalling interworking for basic services that provide a
    bidirectional transfer capability for speech, DTMF, facsimile and modem media
    between a PISN employing QSIG and a private IP network employing H.323. This International
    Standard specifies requirements for establishing user information (audio) connections
    between the PISN and the IP network, but protocols for transmitting audio in the
    IP network and for signalling in order to establish and close down audio transmission
    in the IP network are outside the scope of this International Standard. Supplementary
    services are outside the scope of this International Standard.   Interworking
    between QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate
    at a user of a private IP network, or a call originating at a user of a private
    IP network to terminate at a user of a PISN.   Interworking between a PISN employing
    QSIG and a public IP network employing H.323 is outside the scope of this International
    Standard. However, the functionality specified in this International Standard
    is in principle applicable to such a scenario when deployed in conjunction with
    other relevant functionality (e.g., number translation, security functions, etc.).   ISO/IEC
    23289:2002 is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between
    a PISN employing QSIG and a private IP network employing H.323.
