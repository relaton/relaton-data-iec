    <p>This document defines data structures and basic operations on property graphs. It provides capabilities for creating, accessing, querying, maintaining, and controlling property graphs and the data they comprise.</p>
    <p>This document specifies the syntax and semantics of a data management language for specifying and modifying the structure of property graphs and collections thereof.</p>
    <p>This document provides a vehicle for portability of data definitions and manipulation among GQL-implementations. Implementations of this document can exist in environments that also support application programming languages, end-user query facilities, and various tools for database design, data administration, and performance optimization.</p>
