    IEC/TS 62239-1:2012(E) defines the requirements for developing an Electronic Components Management Plan (ECMP) to assure customers and regulatory agencies that all of the electronic components in the equipment of the plan owner are selected and applied in controlled processes compatible with the end application and that certain technical requirements are accomplished. In general, the owners of a complete electronic components management plan are avionics equipment manufacturers.
