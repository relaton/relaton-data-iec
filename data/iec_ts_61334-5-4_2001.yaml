abstract:
- content: "Is a technical specification describing the requirements of the multicarrier
    modulation approach which incorporates the services provided by the physical layer
    entity and the MAC sublayer with the purpose of building up a set of standards
    for effective communication on MV and LV network for distribution line carrier
    systems, in the context of IEC 61334-1-1.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is of
    high relevance for Smart Grid."
