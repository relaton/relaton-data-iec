abstract:
- content: "IEC 62541-5:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n IEC 62541-5:2020 defines the
    Information Model of the OPC Unified Architecture. The Information Model describes
    standardized Nodes of a Serverâ€™s AddressSpace. These Nodes are standardized types
    as well as standardized instances used for diagnostics or as entry points to server-specific
    Nodes. Thus, the Information Model defines the AddressSpace of an empty OPC UA
    Server. However, it is not expected that all Servers will provide all of these
    Nodes.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Added Annex F on User Authentication. Describes the Role
    Information Model that also allows configuration of Roles.<br />\r\nb) Added new
    data types: \"Union\", \"Decimal\", \"OptionSet\", \"DateString\", \"TimeString\",
    \"DurationString\", NormalizedString\", \"DecimalString\", and \"AudioDataType\".<br
    />\r\nc) Added Method to request a state change in a Server.<br />\r\nd) Added
    Method to set Subscription to persistent mode.<br />\r\ne) Added Method to request
    resending of data from a Subscription.<br />\r\nf) Added concept allowing to temporarily
    create a file to write to or read from a server in C.4.<br />\r\ng) Added new
    Variable type to support Selection Lists.<br />\r\nh) Added optional properties
    to FiniteStateMachineType to expose currently available states and transitions.<br
    />\r\ni) Added UrisVersion Property to ServerType. This version information can
    be used for session-less service invocation."
