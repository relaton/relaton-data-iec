abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-90-14:2021(E), which is a technical report, specifies the
    information model of devices and functions related to systems of power utility
    automation, specifically related to FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission Systems) and
    Power Conversion applications.<br />\r\nThe IEC 61850-90-14 information model
    standard utilizes existing IEC 61850-7-4 logical nodes where possible, but also
    defines specific logical nodes where needed.<br />\r\nSpecifically, the scope
    of this document:<br />\r\n• Covers communication between control system of FACTS,
    HVDC and Power Conversion and SCADA and HMI systems<br />\r\n• Includes the data
    model for FACTS, HVDC and Power conversion devices<br />\r\n• Does not cover Protection
    relays<br />\r\n• Does not cover process bus<br />\r\n• Does not cover valve communication"
