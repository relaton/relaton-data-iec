abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 62349:2014(E) applies to polarization-maintaining (PM) optical
    fibres. The object of this report is to define test procedures to be used in establishing
    uniform requirements for the geometrical and transmission properties of PM fibres.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2005.
    It constitutes a technical revision. In this edition, guidance of measurement
    methods and test procedures for dimensional characteristics, cut-off wavelength,
    mode field diameter and beat length of polarization-maintaining optical fibres
    have been added. Thus, the title of the technical report is changed to "Guidance
    of measurement methods and test procedures - Basic tests for polarization-maintaining
    optical fibres" from "Guidance for polarization crosstalk measurement of optical
    fibre". Keywords: polarization-maintaining (PM) optical fibres, geometrical and
    transmission properties'
