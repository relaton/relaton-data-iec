  content: "<p>This document specifies protocols, procedures, and managed objects
    for a Link-local Registration Protocol (LRP) to replicate a registration database
    from one end to the other of a point-to-point link and to replicate changes to
    parts of that database. A facility is provided to purge the replicated database
    if the source becomes unresponsive. Provision is made for a proxy system to operate
    LRP on behalf of a controlled system. LRP is optimized for databases on the order
    of 1 Mbyte.</p>"
