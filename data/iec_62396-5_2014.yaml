abstract:
- content: "IEC 62396-5:2014(E) provides a more precise definition of the threat that
    thermal neutrons pose to avionics as a second mechanism for inducing single event
    upset (SEU) in microelectronics. IEC 62396-5 addresses two main items:<br />\r\n-
    a detailed evaluation of the existing literature on measurements of the thermal
    flux inside of airliners, and<br />\r\n- an enhanced compilation of the thermal
    neutron SEU cross-section in currently available SRAM devices (more than 20 different
    devices). The net result of the reviews of these two different sets of data will
    be two ratios that are considered to be very important for leading to the ultimate
    objective of determining how large a threat is. This new edition includes the
    following technical changes with respect to the previous technical specification:
    document upgraded to an IEC international standard, change to title, updated references
    and bibliography, consideration of smaller geometries, addition of recent data
    on neutron cross-sections, etc."
