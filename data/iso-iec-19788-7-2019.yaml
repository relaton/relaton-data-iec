    <p>This document provides RDF mappings of the different MLR entities introduced in the MLR framework (ISO/IEC 19788‑1 and its amendment): data element specifications (DESs), resource classes (RCs), data elements (DEs), application profiles (APs), MLR records and data element group specifications (DEGSs).</p>
    <p>This document associates HTTP IRIs (linguistically neutral and linguistic) to conceptual MLR entities denoted by MLR identifiers. This is needed for the management of MLR entities and their versions.</p>
    <p>Moreover, this document provides excerpts of an OWL 2 DL ontology for the resource classes and data element specifications (properties) introduced in the ISO/IEC 19788 series.</p>
