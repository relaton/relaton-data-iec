  content: "IEC 62561-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62561-1:2023
    specifies the requirements and tests for metallic connection components that form
    part of a lightning protection system (LPS). Typically, these can be connectors,
    clamps, bonding and bridging components, expansion pieces and test joints. This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2017. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    definitions of connection types mentioned in the scope have been added;<br />\r\nb)
    location classification has been expanded in detail;<br />\r\nc) the document
    has been updated in line with the new edition of ISO 22479:2019 on humid sulphurous
    atmosphere treatment;<br />\r\nd) a new normative Annex E for reduced test procedures
    has been introduced."
