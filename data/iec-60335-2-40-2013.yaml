  content: "IEC 60335-2-40:2013(E) deals with the safety of electric heat pumps, including
    sanitary hot water heat pumps, air-conditioners, and dehumidifiers incorporating
    motor-compressors and hydronic room fan coils, their maximum rated voltages being
    not more than 250 V for single phase appliances and 600 V for all other appliances.\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. This standard
    also applies to electric heat pumps, air conditioners and dehumidifiers containing
    flammable refrigerant. Flammable refrigerants are defined in 3.121. The appliances
    referenced above may consist of one or more factory made assemblies. If provided
    in more than one assembly, the separate assemblies are to be used together, and
    the requirements are based on the use of matched assemblies. This standard does
    not take into account chemicals other than group A1, A2, or A3 as defined by ANSI/ASHRAE
    34 [ISO 817] classification. This standard specifies particular requirements for
    the use of flammable refrigerants. Unless specifications are covered by this standard,
    including the annexes, requirements for refrigerating safety are covered by ISO
    5149. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in
    2002, it's Amendment 1 (2005), it's Amendment 2 (2005) and it's Corrigendum 1
    (2006). It constitutes a technical revision. The principal changes in this edition
    as compared with the fourth edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- 3.127 and 3.128
    added new definitions;<br />\r\n- 5.10 length of refrigerant lines now specified
    for testing;<br />\r\n- 7.1 changed marking requirements for flammable refrigerants;<br
    />\r\n- 8.15 added requirement to clarify the placement of installation panels
    during testing;<br />\r\n- 11.2.1 clarification of test procedure;<br />\r\n-
    19 (whole clause) replaced in its entirety;<br />\r\n- 21.2 added new coverage
    for vibration considerations during transport;<br />\r\n- 22.46 added clarification
    for PEC;<br />\r\n- 22.118 added coverage for use of mechanical connectors indoors
    when employing flammable refrigerants;<br />\r\n- 32 made this section of Part
    1 applicable;<br />\r\n- Annex FF2.4 revised calculation for calculating volume
    (V);<br />\r\n- Annex FF2.5 revision of allowable concentration of flammable refrigerant
    gas;<br />\r\n- Annex GG8 new coverage added;<br />\r\n- Annex HH added informative
    annex.\r\nKey words: heat pumps, air-conditioners, dehumidifiers, flammable refrigerant\r\n\r\n<br
