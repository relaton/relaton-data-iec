  content: "IEC 60601-2-16:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-16:2018
    applies to the basic safety and essential performance of haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration
    and haemofiltration equipment. IEC 60601-2-16:2018 does not take into consideration
    the dialysis fluid control system of Haemodialysis equipment using regeneration
    of dialysis fluid and central delivery systems. It does however take into consideration
    the specific safety requirements of such haemodialysis equipment concerning electrical
    safety and patient safety. IEC 60601-2-16:2018 specifies the minimum safety requirements
    for haemodialysis equipment. These devices are intended for use either by medical
    staff or for use by the patient or other trained personnel under the supervision
    of medical expertise. IEC 60601-2-16:2018 includes all electromedical equipment
    that is intended to deliver a haemodialysis, haemodiafiltration and haemofiltration
    treatment to a patient suffering from kidney failure. This fifth edition cancels
    and replaces the fourth edition of IEC 60601-2-16, published in 2012. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) update of references to IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012,
    of references and requirements to IEC 60601-1-2:2014, of references to IEC 60601-1-6:2010
    and IEC 60601-1-6:2010/AMD1:2013, of references and requirements to IEC 60601-1-8:2006
    and IEC 60601-1-8:2006/AMD1:2012, of references to IEC 60601-1-9:2007 and IEC
    60601-1-9:2007/AMD1:2013, of references to IEC 60601-1-10:2007 and IEC 60601-1-10:2007/AMD1:2013
    and of references to IEC 60601-1-11:2015;<br />\r\nb) widening of the scope;<br
    />\r\nc) editorial improvements;<br />\r\nd) addition of requirements for anticoagulant
    delivery means;<br />\r\ne) other few small technical changes."
