abstract:
- content: "IEC 62899-202-4:2021(E) defines the terminology and measurement methods
    for the properties of stretchable printed layers, such as conductive ink, for
    forming stretchable conductors by printing, stretchable conductive films obtained
    from conductive ink, and stretchable printed wiring consisted by conductive ink
    with insulator.<br />\r\nStretchable printed layers (conductive and insulating)
    handled by this document apply to the stretchable electric wiring printed on stretchable
    substrates, for example fabric integrated wearable devices, skin patchable devices,
    and so on."
