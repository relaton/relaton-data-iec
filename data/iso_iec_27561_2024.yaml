abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 27561:2024 This guidance document describes a model and method
    to operationalize the privacy principles specified in ISO/IEC 29100 into sets
    of controls and functional capabilities. The method is described as a process
    that builds upon ISO/IEC/IEEE 24774.<br />\r\nThis document is designed for use
    in conjunction with relevant privacy and security standards and guidance which
    impact privacy operationalization. It supports networked, interdependent applications
    and systems. This document is intended for engineers and other practitioners developing
    systems controlling or processing personally identifiable information."
