  content: "IEC 62153-4-7:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62153-4-7:2021
    deals with the triaxial tube in tube method. This triaxial method is suitable
    to determine the surface transfer impedance and/or screening attenuation and coupling
    attenuation of mated screened connectors (including the connection between cable
    and connector) and cable assemblies. This method could also be extended to determine
    the transfer impedance, coupling or screening attenuation of balanced or multipin
    connectors and multicore cable assemblies. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2015 and its Amendment 1:2018.This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- Annex E contains informative information about the direct measurement
    of screening effectiveness of connectors;<br />\r\n- Annex F gives normative information
    about mixed mode parameters;<br />\r\n- Annex G contains normative information
    about accessories for measuring coupling attenuation;<br />\r\n- Annex H discusses
    the low frequency screening attenuation."
