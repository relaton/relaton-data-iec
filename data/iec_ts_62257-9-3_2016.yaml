abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-9-3:2016(E) specifies the general requirements for the design
    and the implementation of the interface equipment within the user's installation
    which connects to a microgrid or the generating part of a standalone system. It
    applies to simplified user's interfaces (distribution board) in electrical installations
    with maximum power of 500 VA in decentralized rural electrification systems. The
    main technical changes with regard to the previous edition are as follows: changing
    the voltage range covered by the technical specification to AC nominal voltage
    below 1 000 V and DC nominal voltage below 1 500 V.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62257 series."
