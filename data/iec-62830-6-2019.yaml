  content: IEC 62830-6:2019(E) defines terms, definitions, symbols, and specifies
    configurations and test methods to be used to evaluate and determine the performance
    characteristics of vertical contact mode triboelectric energy harvesting devices
    for practical use. This document is applicable to energy harvesting devices as
    power sources for wearable devices and wireless sensors used in healthcare monitoring,
    consumer electronics, general industries, military and aerospace applications
    without any limitations on device technology and size.
