abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62657-1:2014(en) provides the wireless communication requirements
    dictated by the applications of wireless communication systems in industrial automation,
    and requirements of related context. The requirements are specified in a way that
    is independent of the wireless technology employed. The requirements are described
    in detail and in such a way as to be understood by a large audience, including
    readers who are not familiar with the industry applications. Social aspects, environmental
    aspects, health aspects and market requirements for wireless communication systems
    in industrial automation are described to justify the wireless communication requirements.
    This Technical Specification describes requirements of the industrial automation
    applications that can be used to ask for additional dedicated, worldwide unique
    spectrum. This additional spectrum is intended to be used for additional wireless
    applications while continuing using the current ISM bands.
