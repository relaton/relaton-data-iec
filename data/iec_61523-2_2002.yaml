abstract:
- content: Applies to CMOS ASIC libraries which contain cell based primitives and
    memories to be used during the pre-layout design phase of logic simulation, timing
    verification and logic synthesis.The delay calculation method addressed in this
    standard consists of 1) estimation of wire capacitance 2 ) Delay calculation method
    based on tablelook-up. With use of DCL and SDF, this delay calculation method
    helps the user have a unified timing model for various EDA tools in the pre-layout
    design phase.
