abstract:
- content: "IEC 61557-7:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61557-7:2019
    specifies the requirements applicable to measuring equipment for testing the phase
    sequence in three-phase distribution systems. Indication of the phase sequence
    can be mechanical, visual and/or audible. This document does not apply to additional
    measurements for other quantities. It does not apply to monitoring relays. IEC
    61557-7:2019 cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2007. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment of the structure with
    that of the whole IEC 61557 series;<br />\r\nb) updated requirements in 4.3 in
    accordance with new editions of IEC 61010-1 and IEC 61010-031;<br />\r\nc) the
    information on markings was extended;<br />\r\nd) the information on the operating
    instructions was extended;<br />\r\ne) complement to the information on the testing
    of leads;<br />\r\nf) test leads for insulated conductors were introduced;<br
    />\r\ng) Annex B was added with information on phase sequence tests and indications."
