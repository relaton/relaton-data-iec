abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-202:2022 specifies the development stages of Tidal Energy
    Converters up to the pre-prototype scale (Stages 1 to 3). It includes the hydraulic
    laboratory test programs, where environmental conditions are controlled so they
    can be scheduled, and the first scaled system open-water trials, where combinations
    of tidal currents, wind and waves occur naturally and the programs are adjusted
    and flexible to accommodate these conditions. This document describes the minimum
    test programs that form the basis of a structured technology development schedule.
    For each testing campaign, the prerequisites, goals and minimum test plans are
    specified. This document addresses:<br />\r\na: Planning an experimental program,
    including a design statement, technical drawings, selection of scale and facility
    based on physical laws, site data and other inputs;\r\nb: Device representation
    and characterization, including the physical device model, power-take-off components,
    foundation and mooring arrangements where appropriate;\r\n\r\nc: Energy resource
    and environment characterization, concerning either the tank testing facility
    or the open-water deployment site, depending on the stage of development;\r\n\r\nd:
    Specification of explicit test goals, including power conversion performance and
    device loads."
