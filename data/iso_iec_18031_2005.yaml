abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18031:2005 specifies a conceptual model for a random bit generator
    for cryptographic purposes, together with the elements of this model.   ISO/IEC
    18031:2005 also includes    the description of the main elements required for
    a non-deterministic random bit generator;  the description of the main elements
    required for a deterministic random bit generator;  their characteristics;   their
    security requirements.     Techniques for statistical testing of random bit generators
    for the purposes of independent verification or validation, and detailed designs
    for such generators, are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18031:2005.
