    used in the new edition of the IEC 61850 standard series;<br />\r\nb) updating
    of existing definitions to the new domain power utility automation of the IEC
    61850 standard series and to provide homogeneity<br />\r\nc) removal of deprecated
    definitions (logical device class; generic system state event; substation automation
    system);<br />\r\nd) provision of clarifications and corrections to the first
