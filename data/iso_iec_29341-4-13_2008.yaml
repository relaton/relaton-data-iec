abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-4-13:2008(E) provides control points with the ability
    to query and/or adjust any rendering attribute that the device supports, such
    as control characteristics (e.g. brightness and contrast) and audio characteristics
    (e.g. volume, balance and equalizer settings). The series of ISO/IEC 29341 publications
    defines an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer network connectivity of intelligent
    appliances, wireless devices and PCs. It is designed to bring easy to use, flexible,
    standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home,
    in a small business, public spaces or attached to the Internet.</p>"
