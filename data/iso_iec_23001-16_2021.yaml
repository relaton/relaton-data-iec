abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a storage format for derived visual tracks and
    an initial base set of related transformation operations. The format defined in
    this document enables the interchange, editing, and display of timed sequences
    of images that result from transformation operations applied to input still images
    or samples of timed sequences of images in the same presentation.</p><p>This format
    defines normative structures used to contain the description of transformation
    operations, how to link that transformation operations to the inputs, and defines
    how to process those transformation operations to obtain a timed sequence of video
    frames.</p>"
