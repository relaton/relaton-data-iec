abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies a common, interoperable
    set of extensible properties for the description of resource content, functionality,
    user needs and preferences, to enable network-supported individualization of resources,
    services and environments to match the unique needs and preferences of the individual.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document includes all relevant mechanisms for the publication
    of terminology for such descriptions, including publicly available registries
    of properties and related metadata resources such as application profiles.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document takes an inclusive approach to individualization,
    since any user can experience a mismatch of their individual needs and preferences
    and the content or services delivered; it is not restricted to descriptions related
    to stereotypical notions of disability. It provides properties for describing
    access attributes of resources. It does not ascribe medical conditions to such
    properties (e.g. ‘non-visual’ as a property value does not infer visual disability,
    as when the user’s eyes are busy watching the road).</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document defines a set of core Access for All (AfA) properties that can be used
    in a digital resource description (DRD), an AfA record, and equally in a stored
    personal needs and preferences profile, also an AfA record. It also includes how
    to extend or add a property or its value using an application profile as defined
    by ISO/IEC 19788-1.</p>
