abstract:
- content: The GS1 DataBar family contains three types of linear symbologies to be
    used with the GS1 system. The first type has four variations (GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional,
    GS1 DataBar Truncated, GS1 DataBar Stacked and GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional).
    The stacked variations are two-row symbols. The second type comprises only one
    variation, namely GS1 DataBar Limited. The third type has two variations, a single
    row variation (GS1 DataBar Expanded) and a multi-row stacked variation (GS1 DataBar
    Expanded Stacked). The use of GS1 DataBar is intended to comply with the GS1 application
    guidelines as defined in the GS1 General Specifications. GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional
    and GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional encode a 14-digit GS1 item identification
    (often referred to as a Global Trade Item Number, or GTIN) in a linear symbol
    that can be scanned omnidirectionally by suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners.
    GS1 DataBar Truncated and GS1 DataBar Stacked encode a 14-digit GS1 item identification
    in a linear symbol and are not suitable for omnidirectional scanning. GS1 DataBar
    Limited encodes a 14-digit GS1 item identification with a leading digit of zero
    or one in a linear symbol for use on small items that will not be scanned at the
    point-of-sale. GS1 DataBar Expanded encodes GS1 item identification plus supplementary
    application identifier element strings such as weight and "best before" date in
    a linear symbol that can be scanned omnidirectionally by suitably programmed point-of-sale
    scanners. Any member of the GS1 DataBar family can be printed as a stand-alone
    linear symbol or as part of a GS1 Composite symbol with an accompanying two-dimensional
    (2D) component printed above the GS1 DataBar linear component.GS1 DataBar symbols
    are intended for encoding identification numbers and data supplementary to the
    identification. The administration of the numbering system by GS1 ensures that
    identification codes assigned to particular items are unique worldwide and that
    they and the associated supplementary data are defined in a consistent way. The
    major benefit for the users of the GS1 system is the availability of uniquely
    defined identification codes and supplementary data formats for use in their trading
    transactions.ISO/IEC 24724:2011 defines the requirements for the GS1 DataBar symbology
    family. It specifies the characteristics of the GS1 DataBar symbology family,
    data character encodation, symbol formats, dimensions, print quality requirements,
    error detection, and decoding algorithms.For GS1 Composite symbols, ISO/IEC 24723
    defines the 2D component.GS1 DataBar was formerly known as "Reduced Space Symbology
    (RSS)" and is renamed to align with the name of the GS1 organization.
