- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>The GS1 DataBar family contains
    three types of linear symbologies to be used with the GS1 system. The first type
    has four variations (GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional, GS1 DataBar Truncated, GS1 DataBar
    Stacked and GS1 DataBar Stacked Omnidirectional). The stacked variations are two-row
    symbols. The second type comprises only one variation, namely GS1 DataBar Limited.
    The third type has two variations, a single row variation (GS1 DataBar Expanded)
    and a multi-row stacked variation (GS1 DataBar Expanded Stacked). The use of GS1
    DataBar is intended to comply with the GS1 application guidelines as defined in
    the GS1 General Specifications.</p><p>GS1 DataBar Omnidirectional and GS1 DataBar
    Stacked Omnidirectional encode a 14-digit GS1 item identification (often referred
    to as a Global Trade Item Number, or GTIN) in a linear symbol that can be scanned
    omnidirectionally by suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners. GS1 DataBar Truncated
    and GS1 DataBar Stacked encode a 14-digit GS1 item identification in a linear
    symbol and are not suitable for omnidirectional scanning. GS1 DataBar Limited
    encodes a 14-digit GS1 item identification with a leading digit of zero or one
    in a linear symbol for use on small items that will not be scanned at the point-of-sale.
    GS1 DataBar Expanded encodes GS1 item identification plus supplementary application
    identifier element strings such as weight and "best before" date in a linear symbol
    that can be scanned omnidirectionally by suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners.</p><p>Any
    member of the GS1 DataBar family can be printed as a stand-alone linear symbol
    or as part of a GS1 Composite symbol with an accompanying two-dimensional (2D)
    component printed above the GS1 DataBar linear component.</p><p>GS1 DataBar symbols
    are intended for encoding identification numbers and data supplementary to the
    identification. The administration of the numbering system by GS1 ensures that
    identification codes assigned to particular items are unique worldwide and that
    they and the associated supplementary data are defined in a consistent way. The
    major benefit for the users of the GS1 system is the availability of uniquely
    defined identification codes and supplementary data formats for use in their trading
    transactions.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24724:2011 defines the requirements for the GS1 DataBar
    symbology family. It specifies the characteristics of the GS1 DataBar symbology
    family, data character encodation, symbol formats, dimensions, print quality requirements,
    error detection, and decoding algorithms.</p><p>For GS1 Composite symbols, ISO/IEC
    24723 defines the 2D component.</p><p>GS1 DataBar was formerly known as "Reduced
    Space Symbology (RSS)" and is renamed to align with the name of the GS1 organization.</p>
