abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-1-100:2022 gives the general requirements and conditions for
    electrical tests to be performed on coaxial communication cables and applies to
    IEC 61196-1-1xx (all parts), which specifies electrical test methods for coaxial
    communication cables. Further test details (for example, temperature, duration)
    and/or test requirements are given in the relevant test procedure and/or the relevant
    sectional or detail specification. A table with electrical test methods of the
    IEC 61196-1-1xx series is given in Annex A. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2015. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- update of Annex
    A, Electrical test methods of the IEC 61196-1-1xx series."
