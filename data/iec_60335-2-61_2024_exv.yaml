abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-61:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-61:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-61:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric thermal-storage room heaters for household and similar purposes that
    are intended to heat the room in which they are located, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances. Appliances not intended for
    normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact
    that<br />\r\n- this standard only applies to self-contained thermal-storage room
    heaters. However, it can be used as a guide, in so far as it reasonably applies,
    to determine the requirements and test specifications for other thermal-storage
    room heaters;<br />\r\n- for heaters incorporating direct-acting heating elements,
    IEC 60335-2-30 is also applicable;<br />\r\n- for heaters intended to be used
    in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br
    />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n-
    appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- heaters incorporated
    in the building structure;<br />\r\n- central heating systems;<br />\r\n- heaters
    for saunas (IEC 60335-2-53);<br />\r\n- flexible sheet heating elements for room
    heating (IEC 60335-2-96);<br />\r\n- heaters intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2005 and Amendment 2:2008. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion or conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1, 10.1, 19.3.102, 24.101);<br />\r\nc) application
    of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nd) temperature limits
    have been updated and requirements for measurement were defined (Clause 11.3,
    11.8, Table 101);<br />\r\ne) implementation of Figure 101 with the probe for
    measuring surface temperatures.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
