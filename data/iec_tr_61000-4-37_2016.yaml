abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61000-4-37:2016 outlines a typical test procedure for harmonic analysis
    in systems comprising tests apparatus designed to comply with IEC 61000-4-7, and
    products designed to comply with IEC 61000-3-2 and&#x2F;or IEC 61000-3-12. The
    test procedure is intended to provide a systematic guidance suitable for use by
    manufacturers, end users, independent test laboratories and other bodies, for
    the purpose of determining the applicable compliance status within a wide range
    of harmonic current emissions. It is not intended as a replacement for type testing
    of harmonic analyzers, nor does it check all of the parameters specified in IEC
    61000-4-7, IEC 61000-3-2, and IEC 61000-3-12. This publication contains attached
    files in the form of an xls document and a user guide. These files are intended
    to be used as a complement and do not form an integral part of the standard.
