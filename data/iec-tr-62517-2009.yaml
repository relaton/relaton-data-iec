  content: "IEC/TR 62517:2009(E) describes the magnetizing behaviour of permanent
    magnets in detail covering:<br /> \n- the relationship between the applied magnetic
    field strength and the effectively acting internal field strength;<br />\n- the
    initial state prior to magnetization;<br />\n- the magnetizing behaviour of all
    common types of permanent magnets subdivided according to the dominant coercivity
    mechanisms, namely the nucleation type for sintered Ferrites, RE-Fe-B and SmCo5
    magnets, the pinning type for carbon steel and Sm2Co17 magnets and the single
    domain type for nano-crystalline RE-Fe-B, Alnico and Cr-Fe-Co magnets;<br />\n-
    the recommended magnetizing field strengths for modern permanent magnets compiled
    in a comprehensive table."
