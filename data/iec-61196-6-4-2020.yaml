  content: "IEC 61196-6-4:2020 applies to coaxial communication cables described in
    IEC 61196-6. It specifies the requirements for 75-7 type CATV drop cables. These
    cables are used in CATV distribution systems, surveillance & control systems,
    satellite television receiving systems and as bidirectional hybrid fibre coaxes
    (HFC). The operating frequency is from 5 MHz to 3 000 MHz. This part of IEC 61196
    is to be used in conjunction with IEC 61196-1:2005 and IEC 61196‑6:2009. It determines
    the layout and style with respect to the model and type. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition, published in 2018. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    designation of variants including construction details;<br />\r\n- consistent
    screening classes;<br />\r\n- bending test only for flexible cables."
