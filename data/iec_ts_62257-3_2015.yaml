abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-3:2015(E) provides information on the responsibilities involved
    in the implementation of rural power systems. More particularly it covers:<br
    />\r\n- contractual relationships to be built between the different participants
    to a project;<br />\r\n- the relevant tests to be applied to renewable energy
    and hybrid electrification systems;<br />\r\n- quality assurance principles to
    be implemented;<br />\r\n- requirements for recycling and protection of the environment.
    The main technical changes with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br
    />\r\n- redefine the maximum AC voltage from 500 V to 1 000 V, the maximum DC
    voltage from 750 V to 1 500 V;<br />\r\n- removal of the limitation of 100 kVA
    system size.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with
    IEC 62257 series."
