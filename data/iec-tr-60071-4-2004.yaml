  content: Gives guidance on conducting insulation co-ordination studies which propose
    internationally recognized recommendations - for the numerical modelling of electrical
    systems, and - for the implementation of deterministic and probabilistic methods
    adapted to the use of numerical programmes. Its object is to give information
    in terms of methods, modelling and examples, allowing for the application of the
    approaches presented in IEC 60071-2, and for the selection of insulation levels
    of equipment or installations, as defined in IEC 60071-1.
