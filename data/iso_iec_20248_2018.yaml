abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 20248:2018 is an ISO/IEC 9594‑8 (Public Key Infrastructure:
    digital signatures and certificates) application specification for automated identification
    services. It specifies a method whereby data stored within a barcode and/or RFID
    tag are structured, encoded and digitally signed. ISO/IEC 9594‑8 is used to provide
    a standard method for key and data description management and distribution. It
    is worth noting that the data capacity and/or data transfer capacity of Automated
    Identification Data Carriers are restricted. This restricts the normal use of
    a Digital Signature as specified in ISO/IEC 9594‑8 within automated identification
    services.</p><p>The purpose of this document is to provide an open and interoperable
    method, between automated identification services and data carriers, to read data,
    verify data originality and data integrity in an offline use case.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    20248:2018 specifies</p><p>- the meta data structure, the DigSig, which contains
    the Digital Signature and encoded structured data,</p><p>- the public key certificate
    parameter and extension use, the DigSig Certificate, which contains the certified
    associated public key, the structured data description, the read methods and private
    containers,</p><p>- the method to specify, read, describe, sign, verify, encode
    and decode the structured data, the DigSig Data Description,</p><p>- the DigSig
    EncoderGenerator which generates the relevant asymmetric key pairs, keeps the
    Private Key secret and generates the DigSigs, and</p><p>- the DigSig DecoderVerifier
    which, by using to the DigSig Certificate, reads the DigSig from the set of Data
    Carriers, verifies the DigSig and extracts the structured data from the DigSig.</p><p>A
    successful verification of the DigSig signifies the following:</p><p>- the data
    was not tampered with;</p><p>- the source of the data is as indicated on the DigSig
    Certificate used to verify the DigSig with;</p><p>- if a secured identifier of
    the data carrier is included in the DigSig it contains, then the data stored on
    the data carrier can be considered as the original issued copy of the data; the
    secure identifier will be able to guarantee that the data carrier is authentic.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    20248:2018 does not specify</p><p>- cryptographic methods, nor</p><p>- key management
    methods.</p><p>ISO/IEC 20248:2018 is used in conjunction with standard risk assessments
    of the use environment.</p>"
