  content: IEC TS 62271-319:2024 is applicable to alternating current circuit-breakers
    with intentional non-simultaneous pole operation designed for indoor or outdoor
    installations and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on systems having
    voltages above 1 000 V. This document provides additional ratings and type tests
    to be conducted for this type of circuit-breaker and is intended to be used in
    conjunction with IEC 62271‑100:2021. Intentional non-simultaneous pole operation
    can be implemented by mechanical or electrical means and both methods are within
    the scope of this document.
