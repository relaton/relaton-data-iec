abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is one of a series of standards describing the characteristics
    for identification cards as defined in the definitions clause and the use of such
    cards for international interchange.</p><p>This document specifies requirements
    for a high coercivity magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on an
    identification card and encoding technique. It takes into consideration both human
    and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.</p><p>Coercivity influences
    many of the quantities specified in this document but is not itself specified.
    The main characteristic of the high coercivity magnetic stripe is its improved
    resistance to erasure. This is achieved with minimal probability of damage to
    other magnetic stripes by contact while retaining read compatibility with magnetic
    stripes as defined in ISO/IEC 7811-2.</p><p>This document provides for a card
    capacity of approximately 10 times that of a card conforming to ISO/IEC 7811-6.
    The number of tracks has been increased to 6, each track being approximately half
    the width of tracks conforming to ISO/IEC 7811-6, located so that readers designed
    to read these high density tracks will also be able to read cards conforming to
    ISO/IEC 7811-2 and ISO/IEC 7811-6. Data is encoded in 8 bit bytes using the MFM
    encoding technique. Data framing is used to limit error propagation and error
    correction techniques further improve reliability of reading.</p><p>It is the
    purpose of the ISO/IEC 7811 series of standards to provide criteria to which cards
    shall perform. No consideration is given within these standards to the amount
    of use, if any, experienced by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified
    criteria is negotiated between the involved parties.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10373-2 specifies
    the test procedures used to check cards against the parameters specified in this
    document.</p><p>NOTE Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial measurement system
    in this document may have been rounded off and are consistent with, but not exactly
    equal to each other. Using either system is correct but intermixing or reconverting
    values can result in errors. The original design was made using the Imperial measurement
    system.</p>"
