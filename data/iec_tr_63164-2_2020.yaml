abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63164-2:2020 provides guidance on the calculation of reliability
    data of automation systems which can be simplified as series, parallel or mixed
    structure based on reliability data of single devices and/or sub-systems, and
    on the form to present the data.<br />\r\nNOTE This procedure is only targeted
    to the reliability of automation systems, but not systems that embed automation
    systems, e.g. process plant.<br />\r\nReliability is included in dependability,
    and this document is mainly focused on random hardware failures that affect reliability.
    Dependability is used as a collective term for the time-related quality characteristics
    of an item and additionally includes availability, recoverability, maintainability,
    maintenance support performance, and, in some cases, other characteristics such
    as durability, safety and security, which are all not in the scope of this Technical
    Report."
