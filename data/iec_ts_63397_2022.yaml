abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63397:2022 defines additional testing requirements for modules deployed
    under applications or in environments where PV modules are likely to be exposed
    to the impact of hailstones leading to higher stress beyond the scope of the IEC
    61215 series. This document aims to assist in the selection of modules for deployment
    in specific regions that have a higher risk of hail damage and to provide tools
    for improving module design.
