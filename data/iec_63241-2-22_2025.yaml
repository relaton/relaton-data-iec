abstract:
- content: "IEC 63241-2-22: 2025 applies to hand-held cut-off machines and wall chasers.<br
    />\r\nThis document is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC
    63241-1:2023.<br />\r\nThis document supplements or modifies the corresponding
    clauses in IEC 63241-1, so as to convert it into the IEC Standard: Particular
    requirements for hand-held cut-off machines and wall chasers.<br />\r\nWhere a
    particular subclause of Part 1 is not mentioned in this Part 2-22, that subclause
    applies as far as relevant. Where this standard states \"addition\", \"modification\"
    or \"replacement\", the relevant text in Part 1 is to be adapted accordingly."
