    procedures to be followed in establishing, maintaining, and publishing registers
    of unique, unambiguous and permanent identifiers and meanings that are assigned
    to Open-edi scenarios and scenario components. In order to accomplish this purpose,
    ISO/IEC 15944-2:2015 specifies elements of information that are necessary to provide
    identification and meaning to the registered items and to manage the registration
    of these items.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15944-2:2015 defines the procedures to be applied
    by qualified JTC1 Registration Authority(ies) appointed by the ISO and IEC council
    to maintain a register(s) of Open-edi scenarios and/or scenario components for
    the purpose of their reusability.</p>
