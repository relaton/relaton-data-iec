abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-353:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60092-353:2016 is
    applicable to shipboard and offshore non radial field power cables with extruded
    solid insulation, having a voltage rating of 0,6/1 (1,2) kV or 1,8/3 (3,6) kV
    intended for fixed installations. Cables designed to maintain circuit integrity
    during fire are included. The various types of power cables are given in 5.1.
    The constructional requirements and test methods are aligned with those<br />\r\nindicated
    in IEC 60092-350, unless otherwise specified in this document. The object of this
    document is:<br />\r\n- to standardize cables whose safety and reliability is
    ensured when they are installed in accordance with the requirements of IEC 60092-352
    or IEC 61892-4,<br />\r\n- to lay down standard manufacturing requirements and
    characteristics of such cables directly or indirectly bearing on safety, and<br
    />\r\n- to specify test methods for checking conformity with those requirements.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- updated references to IEC 60092-350 for general
    construction and test methods and IEC 60092-360 for insulating and sheathing materials."
