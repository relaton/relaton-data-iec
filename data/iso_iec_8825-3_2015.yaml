abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 8825-3:2015 defines a notation for specifying encodings of ASN.1
    types or of parts of types.<p>It provides several mechanisms for such specification,
    including:</p><p>- direct specification of the encoding using standardized notation;</p><p>-
    specification of the encoding by reference to standardized encoding rules;</p><p>-
    specification of the encoding of an ASN.1 type by reference to an encoding structure;</p><p>-
    specification of the encoding using non-ECN notation.</p><p>It also provides the
    means to link the specification of encodings to the type definitions to which
    they are to be applied.</p><p>ECN does not currently provide any support for specifications
    using the OID internationalized resource identifier type or the relative OID internationalized
    resource identifier type (see Rec. ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1), and these are
    not referred to further in this Standard.</p>
