abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 10646:2003 specifies the Universal Multiple-Octet Coded Character
    Set (UCS). It is applicable to the representation, transmission, interchange,
    processing, storage, input and presentation of the written form of the languages
    of the world as well as additional symbols.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 10646:2003<br
    />\r\nspecifies the architecture of ISO/IEC 10646:2003;<br />\r\ndefines terms
    used in ISO/IEC 10646:2003;<br />\r\ndescribes the general structure of the coded
    character set;<br />\r\nspecifies the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the UCS;<br
    />\r\nspecifies supplementary planes of the UCS: the Supplementary Multilingual
    Plane (SMP), the Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP) and the Supplementary Special-purpose
    Plane (SSP);<br />\r\ndefines a set of graphic characters used in scripts and
    the written form of languages on a world-wide scale;<br />\r\nspecifies the names
    for the graphic characters of the BMP, SMP, SIP, SSP and their coded representations;<br
    />\r\nspecifies the four-octet (32-bit) canonical form of the UCS: UCS-4;<br />\r\nspecifies
    a two-octet (16-bit) BMP form of the UCS: UCS-2;<br />\r\nspecifies a multiple
    byte (one to four) byte transformation UTF-8 for use with ISO 646 (ASCII) byte-oriented
    environments;<br />\r\nspecifies a two 16-bit form and associated transformation
    UTF-16 for supplementary characters;<br />\r\nspecifies collection identifiers
    for selected set of character subsets;<br />\r\nspecifies the coded representations
    for control functions;<br />\r\nspecifies the management of future additions to
    this coded character set;<br />\r\nincorporates the Unicode bi-directional algorithm
    and normalization forms by reference.<br /><br />\r\nThe UCS is a coding system
    different from that specified in ISO/IEC 2022. A graphic character will be assigned
    only one code position in ISO/IEC 10646:2003, located either in the BMP or in
    one of the supplementary planes.<br /><br />\r\nNOTE - The Unicode Standard, Version
    4.0 includes a set of characters, names, and coded representations that are identical
    with those in ISO/IEC 10646:2003. It additionally provides details of character
    properties, processing algorithms, and definitions that are useful to implementers.
    Version 4.0 strengthens Unicode support for worldwide communication, software
    availability, and publishing.<br /><br />\r\nBy defining a consistent way of encoding
    multilingual text ISO/IEC 10646:2003 enables the exchange of data internationally.
    The information technology industry gains data stability, greater global interoperability
    and data interchange. ISO/IEC 10646:2003 has been widely adopted in new Internet
    and W3C protocols and mark up languages such as XML and HTML, and implemented
    in modern operating systems and computer programming languages. This edition covers
    over 96 000 characters from the world's scripts."
