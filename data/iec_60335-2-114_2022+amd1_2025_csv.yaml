abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-114:2022+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the electrical safety of
    Personal e-Transporters used in the private or public areas. The device can have
    one or more wheels, self-balancing provisions, provisions for the transport of
    cargo and can be for private, commercial, shared use or for hire.<br />\r\nExamples
    of devices that are within the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n– self-balancing
    transport devices with or without a seat (also known as hover boards);<br />\r\n–
    electric scooters without a seat including scooters with detachable seats;<br
    />\r\n– electric mono-wheels with or without a seat;<br />\r\n– electric skateboards.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– electric mopeds with a seat;<br />\r\n–
    electric bicycles;<br />\r\n– electric motorcycles;<br />\r\n– devices exclusively
    intended for use by people with a physical disability such as electrically powered
    wheel chairs;<br />\r\n– devices with hybrid power mode such as Personal e-Transporters
    incorporating a small internal combustion motor where the internal combustion
    motor is the primary power source;<br />\r\n– ride-on or walk-behind commercial
    floor treatment machines (IEC 60335-2-72).<br />\r\nAn electric scooter with a
    seat is classified as an electric moped and an electric moped without a seat is
    classified as an electric scooter.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common electrical safety hazards presented by Personal e-Transporters
    that are encountered by all users. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance;<br />\r\n– safety of riding/driving the device including aspects
    such as maximum attainable speed, stability, acceleration, braking, visibility,
    ergonomics, and reliability of driving controls such as acceleration or braking
    controls.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national transport authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) change of title of the standard
    to reflect the expanded scope;<br />\r\nc) expansion of the scope to include a
    variety of Personal e-Transporters;<br />\r\nd) introduction of UV testing for
    markings on Personal e-Transporters for shared use in a public space (7.14);<br
    />\r\ne) introduction of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
