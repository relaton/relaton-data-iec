abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15944-17:2024 This document:<br />\r\na) focuses on PbD aspects
    of privacy protection requirements as external constraints on any type of Person,
    (e.g. organization or public administration) involved in any kind of business
    transaction among such Persons which involves the electronic data interchange
    (EDI) of any personal information;<br />\r\nb) establishes a fundamental set of
    privacy principles known as Privacy by Design and assumptions based on primary
    sources;<br />\r\nc) integrates existing normative elements in support of PbD
    as are already identified in ISO/IEC 14662 and ISO/IEC 15944-1, ISO/IEC 15944-5,
    ISO/IEC 15944-8, ISO 15944-12;<br />\r\nd) provides overarching operational ‘best
    practice’ statements for associated (and not necessarily automated) processes,
    procedures, practices and governance requirements that need to act in support
    of implementing and enforcing technical mechanisms that support PbD in Open-edi
    transaction and collaboration space environments;<br />\r\ne) focuses on PbD related
    aspects of the life cycle management of and accountability for the personal information,
    i.e. the contents of SPIs (and their SRIs) related to the business transaction
    interchanged via EDI as information bundles and their associated semantic components
    among the parties to a business transaction.<br />\r\nThis document focuses on
    the BOV aspects of a business transaction and does not concern itself with the
    technical mechanisms needed to implement the FSV aspects of the business requirements
    of the FSV including the specification of requirements of an FSV nature which
    include security techniques and services, communication protocols, etc.). The
    FSV includes any existing standard (or standards development of an FSV nature),
    which has been ratified by existing ISO, IEC, UN/ECE and/or ITU standards.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not specify the technical mechanisms, i.e. FSV which
    are required to support BOV-identified requirements. Detailed exclusions to the
    scope of this document are provided in Annex D."
