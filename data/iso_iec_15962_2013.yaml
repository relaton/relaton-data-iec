abstract:
- content: "The data protocol used to exchange information in a radio frequency identification
    (RFID) system for item management is specified in ISO/IEC 15961 and in ISO/IEC
    15962:2013. Both International Standards are required for a complete understanding
    of the data protocol in its entirety; but each focuses on one particular interface:<br
    />\r\n\tISO/IEC 15961 addresses the interface with the application system.<br
    />\r\n\tISO/IEC 15962:2013 deals with the processing of data and its presentation
    to the RF tag, and the initial processing of data captured from the RF tag.<br
    /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15962:2013 focuses on encoding the transfer syntax,
    as defined in ISO/IEC 15961 according to the application commands defined in ISO/IEC
    15961. The encodation is in a Logical Memory as a software analogue of the physical
    memory of the RFID tag being addressed by the interrogator.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15962:2013<br />\r\n\tdefines the encoded structure of object identifiers;<br
    />\r\n\tspecifies the data compaction rules that apply to the encoded data;<br
    />\r\n\tspecifies a Precursor for encoding syntax features efficiently;<br />\r\n\tspecifies
    formatting rules for the data, e.g. depending on whether a directory is used or
    not;<br />\r\n\tdefines how application commands, e.g. to lock data, are transferred
    to the Tag Driver;<br />\r\n\tspecifies processes associated with sensory information
    and the transfers to the Tag Driver;<br />\r\n\tdefines other communication to
    the application.<br /><br />"
