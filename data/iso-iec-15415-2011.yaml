    <p>ISO/IEC 15415:2011</p>
    <ul>
    <li>specifies two methodologies for the measurement of specific attributes of two-dimensional bar code symbols, one of these being applicable to multi-row bar code symbologies and the other to two-dimensional matrix symbologies;</li>
    <li>defines methods for evaluating and grading these measurements and deriving an overall assessment of symbol quality;</li>
    <li>gives information on possible causes of deviation from optimum grades to assist users in taking appropriate corrective action.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15415:2011 applies to those two-dimensional symbologies for which a reference decode algorithm has been defined, but its methodologies can be applied partially or wholly to other similar symbologies.</p>
    <p>While ISO/IEC 15415:2011 can be applied to direct part marks, it is possible that better correlation between measurement results and scanning performance will be obtained with ISO/IEC TR 29158 in combination with ISO/IEC 15415:2011.</p>
