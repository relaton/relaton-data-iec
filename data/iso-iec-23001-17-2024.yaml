    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies how uncompressed 2D image and video data is carried in files in the family of standards based on the ISO base media file format (ISO/IEC 14496-12). This includes but is not limited to monochromatic data, colour data, transparency (alpha) information and depth information.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The primary goal of this document is to allow exchange of uncompressed video and image data while relying on the information set provided by the ISO base media file format, such as timing, colour space and sample aspect ratio to specify the interpretation and/or display of video and image data.</span></p>
