abstract:
- content: "IEC 61747-40-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61747-40-1:2019 provides
    mechanical performance testing guidelines for cover glass used in electronic flat
    panel displays in mobile devices. This document focuses on key mechanical testing
    performance parameters and covers mainly strength and damage resistance attributes.
    The test methods focus on the cover glass level testing only. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- withdrawal of test methods unsuitable for mobile display cover,<br />\r\n-
    revision of test methods based on newly developed market relevance,<br />\r\n-
    addition of test method for abraded strength,<br />\r\n- addition of explanations
    about the relevance between the test methods and the fracture mode, and<br />\r\n-
    revision of terms and definitions.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"></ol>"
