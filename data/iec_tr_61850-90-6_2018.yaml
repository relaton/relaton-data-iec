abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-90-6:2018, which is a technical report, provides basic aspects
    that need to be considered when using IEC 61850 for information exchange between
    systems and components to support Distribution Automation applications, within
    MV network automation, as presented in Annex B.<br />\r\nThe contents of Distribution
    Automation (DA) vary between different countries, regions, even between different
    utilities in the same country. DA may cover HV/MV substations, MV networks, LV
    networks, distributed energy resources, as well as demand sides. In particular,
    this document:<br />\r\n• defines use cases for typical DA applications that require
    information exchange between two or more components/systems<br />\r\n• provides
    modelling of components commonly used in DA applications<br />\r\n• proposes new
    logical nodes and the extensions to the existing logical nodes that can be used
    in typical DA applications.<br />\r\n• provides guidelines for the communication
    architecture and services to be used in DA applications<br />\r\n• provides configuration
    methods for IEDs to be used in DA systems.<br />\r\nNOTE - The corrigendum 1 of
    January 2020 is available in the ZIP file."
