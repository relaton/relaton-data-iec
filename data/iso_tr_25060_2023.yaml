abstract:
- content: "This document describes information items enabling systematic human-centred
    design for interactive systems.<br />\r\nSome of these information items are elaborated
    by separate International Standards, named the Common Industry Format (CIF) for
    usability-related information.<br />\r\nThis document provides the framework of
    information items, including definitions and the content for each information
    item.<br />\r\nThis document includes the following:<br />\r\n- the intended users
    of the information items;<br />\r\n- consistent terminology;<br />\r\n- the high-level
    content structure to be used for documenting each information item.<br />\r\nThe
    information items are intended to be used as part of system-level documentation
    resulting from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210, ISO 9241-220
    and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 process standards (e.g. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE
    29148).<br />\r\nThis document focuses on those information items needed for design,
    development and evaluation of usable systems, rather than prescribing a specific
    process. It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International
    Standards, including the standards of the ISO 9241 series and the SQuaRE documents.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not prescribe any kind of method, life cycle or process.<br
    />\r\nNOTE The information items produced by human-centred design activities can
    be incorporated in design approaches as diverse as object-oriented, waterfall,
    HFI (human factors integration), agile and rapid development."
