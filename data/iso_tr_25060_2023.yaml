abstract:
- content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />This document describes information
    items enabling systematic human-centred design for interactive systems.<br />\r\nSome
    of these information items are elaborated by separate International Standards,
    named the Common Industry Format (CIF) for usability-related information.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides the framework of information items, including definitions and
    the content for each information item.<br />\r\nThis document includes the following:<br
    />\r\n- the intended users of the information items;<br />\r\n- consistent terminology;<br
    />\r\n- the high-level content structure to be used for documenting each information
    item.<br />\r\nThe information items are intended to be used as part of system-level
    documentation resulting from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210,
    ISO 9241-220 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 process standards (e.g. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288,
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148).<br />\r\nThis document focuses on those information items
    needed for design, development and evaluation of usable systems, rather than prescribing
    a specific process. It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International
    Standards, including the standards of the ISO 9241 series and the SQuaRE documents.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not prescribe any kind of method, life cycle or process.<br
    />\r\nNOTE The information items produced by human-centred design activities can
    be incorporated in design approaches as diverse as object-oriented, waterfall,
    HFI (human factors integration), agile and rapid development."
