abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9995 defines a framework for the layout of all alphanumeric and
    numeric keyboards across the widest spectrum of today's and upcoming applications
    using keyboards. The functions to be performed by keyboards are grouped into three
    categories that correspond to the main physical sections of the keyboard.Application
    of ISO/IEC 9995 in the design of keyboards will provide the user with a unified,
    predictable user-machine interface by dividing the keyboard into functional areas
    and sections and allocating functions to keys.ISO/IEC 9995-4:2009 specifies the
    numeric section of a keyboard and the division of that section into zones. It
    specifies the arrangement, the number, and the location of the keys in the numeric
    zone ZN0 and in the function zones ZN1 to ZN6 of the numeric section, as well
    as the allocation of functions to the keys.The numeric zone ZN0 is to be used
    in keyboards for applications such as text and data processing, general office
    environment, banking, point of sales (POS), telematic services, telephony apparatus,
    home electronic systems, numerical control of machinery and equipment, and input
    of personal identification number (PIN). The function zone ZN1 is to be used in
    keyboards for applications such as data entry, text and data processing, and general
    office environment.
