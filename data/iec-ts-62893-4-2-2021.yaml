  content: "IEC TS 62893-4-2:2021(E) applies to cables for DC charging according to
    mode 4 of IEC 61851-1. These cables are intended to be used with a thermal management
    system such as that specified in IEC 61851-23.<br />\r\nCharging cables specified
    in IEC 62893 (all parts) are intended to be used for electrical appliances of
    class II equipment.<br />\r\nMaximum conductor operating temperature for the cables
    in this document is 90 ºC.<br />\r\nThe test methods specified are given in IEC
    62893-2, IEC 60227-2, IEC 60245-2, IEC 60332 1 2, IEC 62821-1:2015, Annex B and
    in the relevant parts of IEC 60811.<br />\r\nIEC 62440 is intended to be used
    as guidance on the safe use of cables in this document together with specific
    guidance in Clause 6 of this document."
