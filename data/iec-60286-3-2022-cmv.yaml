    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60286-3:2022
    is applicable to the tape packaging of electronic components without leads or
    with lead stumps, intended to be connected to electronic circuits. It includes
    only those dimensions that are essential for the taping of components intended
    for the above-mentioned purposes. This document also includes requirements related
    to the packaging of singulated die products including bare die and bumped die
    (flip chips). This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">addition terms and definitions.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">addition
    of a table of the classification to symbols concerning drive hole diameter and
    distance between the reel hole centre and the drive hole centre;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">addition of drive hole to the reel (optional);</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">revision of reel hole diameter tolerances;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">revision of 72 mm tape size carrier tape width dimension
    tolerances;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">addition of Annex B (informative);</li>\r\n\t<li
