abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23002-3:2007 defines auxiliary video streams as data coded as video
    sequences and supplementing a primary video sequence. Depth maps and parallax
    maps are the first specified types of auxiliary video streams, relating to stereoscopic-view
    video content. In this context, ISO/IEC 23002-3:2007 specifies syntax and semantics
    for conveying information describing the interpretation of auxiliary video streams.  Syntax
    for such information is specified in ISO/IEC 23002-3:2007 as a stream of data
    referred to as a supplemental information (SI) message stream. Provisions for
    extensibility have been included, so that additional types of data can be defined
    in future extensions of the current SI message stream syntax by ISO/IEC.  An SI
    message stream can contain several concatenated SI messages, hence conveying various
    types of information. The auxiliary video SI (AVSI) is the only currently-defined
    type of SI (other than reserved SI message types that are reserved for future
    specification by ISO/IEC and are to be ignored by decoders if present). An AVSI
    message characterizes the interpretation of an auxiliary video sequence that accompanies
    a primary video sequence. For instance, an AVSI can indicate that the auxiliary
    video represents depth map information, and can provide parameters for the proper
    interpretation of the auxiliary video as such depth information. The means for
    identifying the primary video stream and the auxiliary video stream to which these
    messages pertain is a system-level issue that is outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    23002-3:2007.  Although the auxiliary video SI is the only type of SI that is
    currently specified in ISO/IEC 23002-3:2007, the SI message format has been defined
    in a generic fashion so that it can potentially be used for purposes other than
    aiding in the interpretation of auxiliary video sequences. Any kind of data could
    potentially be carried in the SI message format.
