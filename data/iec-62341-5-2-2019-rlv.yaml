  content: "IEC 62341-5-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62341-5-2:2019 defines
    test methods for evaluating the mechanical endurance quality of organic light
    emitting diode (OLED) display panels and modules or their packaged form for transportation.
    It takes into account, wherever possible, the environmental test methods outlined
    in IEC 60068 (all parts). The object of this document is to establish uniform
    preferred test methods for judging the mechanical endurance properties of OLED
    display devices.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Vibration and shock tests
    for large displays (for example, TVs and monitors) are added.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
