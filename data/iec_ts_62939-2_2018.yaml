abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62939-2:2018(E), which is a Technical Specification, provides an
    architecture to define interfaces for the information exchange between smart equipment/systems
    from the demand side and the power grid. It facilitates the interoperability between
    the IEC common information model (CIM) and customer facility standards for smart
    grid applications.<br />\r\nThis document presents one possible architecture to
    connect non-CIM/IEC 61850-based demand-side standards to the CIM, to support demand
    response type applications.<br />\r\nIt presents an immediately available architecture
    approach for home and building grid users for demand response applications to
    cope with the fragmented market and lack of harmonized standard solutions. It
    proposes that a three-layer application be implemented but this does not preclude
    the ongoing long-term efforts of IEC ideally to promote from a semantic perspective
    only two-layer implementations."
