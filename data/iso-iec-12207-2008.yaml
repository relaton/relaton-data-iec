    <p>ISO/IEC 12207:2008 establishes a common framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software industry. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied during the acquisition of a software product or service and during the supply, development, operation, maintenance and disposal of software products. Software includes the software portion of firmware. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 12207:2008 applies to the acquisition of systems and software products and services, to the supply, development, operation, maintenance, and disposal of software products and the software portion of a system, whether performed internally or externally to an organization. Those aspects of system definition needed to provide the context for software products and services are included. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 12207:2008 also provides a process that can be employed for defining, controlling, and improving software life cycle processes. </p>
    <p>The processes, activities and tasks of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 - either alone or in conjunction with ISO/IEC 15288 - may also be applied during the acquisition of a system that contains software.</p>
