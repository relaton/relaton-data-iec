abstract:
- content: This document provides specifications for non-invasive attack test tools
    and provides information about how to operate such tools. The purpose of the test
    tools is the collection of signals (i.e. side-channel leakage) and their analysis
    as a non-invasive attack on a cryptographic module implementation under test (IUT).
