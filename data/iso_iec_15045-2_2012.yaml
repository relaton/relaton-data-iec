abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 15045-2:2012(E) specifies a gateway architecture that provides
    an interconnection between one or more Wide Area Networks (WANs) and one or more
    Home Area Networks (HANs). It is not needed for a &quot;simple gateway&quot; linking
    one WAN to one HAN where there is no intention of future expansion. It applies
    to a &quot;distributed gateway,&quot; and is also referred to in ISO&#x2F;IEC
    15045-1 as the Complex Modular Gateway. Also, it specifies how separate gateways
    in a single house can interoperate to provide co-ordinated functions.
