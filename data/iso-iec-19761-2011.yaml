    <p>ISO/IEC 19761:2011 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities of the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable to software from the following functional domains:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>application software;</li>
    <li>real-time software;</li>
    <li>hybrids of the above.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19761:2011 has not been designed for measuring the functional size of a piece of software, or its parts, which</p>
    <ul>
    <li>is characterized by complex mathematical algorithms or other specialized and complex rules, such as can be found in expert systems, simulation software, self-learning software and weather forecasting systems, or</li>
    <li>processes continuous variables such as audio sounds or video images, such as can be found in computer game software, musical instruments and the like.</li>
    </ul>
