  content: "IEC 62541-8:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<div>IEC 62541-8:2020 is part
    of the overall OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) standard series and defines the
    information model associated with Data Access (DA). It particularly includes additional
    VariableTypes and complementary descriptions of the NodeClasses and Attributes
    needed for Data Access, additional Properties, and other information and behaviour.<br
    />\r\nThe complete address space model, including all NodeClasses and Attributes
    is specified in IEC 62541-3. The services to detect and access data are specified
    in IEC 62541-4.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) added new VariableTypes for AnalogItems;<br />\r\nb)
    added an Annex that specifies a recommended mapping of OPC UA Dataccess to OPC
    COM DataAccess;<br />\r\nc) changed the ambiguous description of \"Bad_NotConnected\";<br
    />\r\nd) updated description for EUInformation to refer to latest revision of
    UNCEFACT units.</div>"
