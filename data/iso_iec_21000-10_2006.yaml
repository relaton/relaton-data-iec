- content: 'ISO/IEC 21000-10:2006 specifies the syntax and semantics of tools that
    may be used to process Digital Items.ISO/IEC 21000-10:2006 specifies:Digital Item
    Methods: Tools enabling users to include sequences of instructions for adding
    predefined functionality to a Digital Item. Digital Item Methods are authored
    with the Digital Item Method Language, an extension of ECMAScript language (ISO/IEC
    16262), which includes a normative set of Digital Item Base Operations. The predefined
    functionality specified by a Digital Item Method provides a suggested interaction
    between a User and the Digital Item. Digital Item eXtension Operations: Provide
    for extended functionality not included by the normative set of Digital Item Base
    Operations to be implemented efficiently in a higher level programming lanuage.
    Linkage with ISO/IEC 21000-2: Tools for integrating Digital Item Methods and Digital
    Item eXtension Operations with Digital Item Declarations (as specified by ISO/IEC
    21000-2).'
