abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29161:2016 establishes a unique identification scheme for the Internet
    of Things (IoT), based on existing and evolving data structures. This International
    Standard specifies the common rules applicable for unique identification that
    are required to ensure full compatibility across different identities. The unique
    identification is a universal construct for any physical object, virtual object,
    or person. It is used in IoT information systems that need to track or otherwise
    refer to entities. It is intended for use with any IoT media.
