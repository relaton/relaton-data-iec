abstract:
- content: Defines interoperability and security related requirements for using encipherment
    at the physical layer of the ISO Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference
    Model in telecommunication systems conveying Automatic Data Processing (ADP) information.
    Facilitates interoperation of data encipherment equipment. Applicable mainly to
    various encipherment algorithms. Annex B provides additional requirements for
    using DEA and applies to synchronous and asynchronous operation in full and half
    duplex modes. Specifies delayed option and immediate option als incompatible modes
    of synchronous operation.
