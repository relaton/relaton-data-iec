abstract:
- content: <p>This document is intended to provide a generic extensible full body
    image data format for biometric recognition applications requiring exchange of
    human full body image data. Typical applications are:</p><p>a) automated body
    biometric verification and identification of an unknown individual or cadaver
    (one-to-one as well as one-to-many comparison);</p><p>b) support for human verification
    of identity by comparison of individuals against full body images; and</p><p>c)
    support for human examination of full body images with sufficient resolution to
    allow a human examiner to verify identity or identify a living individual or a
    cadaver.</p><p>This document ensures that full human body images and image sequence
    data generated by video surveillance and other similar systems are suitable for
    identification and verification.</p><p>The structure of the data format in this
    document is compatible with ISO/IEC 39794-5. In addition to the data format, this
    document specifies application-specific profiles including scene constraints,
    photographic properties and digital image attributes like image spatial sampling
    rate, image size, etc. These application profiles are contained in a series of
    annexes.</p><p>The 3D encoding types "3D point map" and "range image" are not
    supported by this document.</p>
