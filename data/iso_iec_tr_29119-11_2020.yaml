abstract:
- content: "This document provides an introduction to AI-based systems. These systems
    are typically complex (e.g. deep neural nets), are sometimes based on big data,
    can be poorly specified and can be non-deterministic, which creates new challenges
    and opportunities for testing them.<br />\r\nThis document explains those characteristics
    which are specific to AI-based systems and explains the corresponding difficulties
    of specifying the acceptance criteria for such systems.<br />\r\nThis document
    presents the challenges of testing AI-based systems, the main challenge being
    the test oracle problem, whereby testers find it difficult to determine expected
    results for testing and therefore whether tests have passed or failed. It covers
    testing of these systems across the life cycle and gives guidelines on how AI-based
    systems in general can be tested using black-box approaches and introduces white-box
    testing specifically for neural networks. It describes options for the test environments
    and test scenarios used for testing AI-based systems.<br />\r\nIn this document
    an AI-based system is a system that includes at least one AI component."
