abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    14844:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Do Not Disturb
    and Do Not Disturb Override supplementary services (SS-DND and SS-DNDO) at the
    Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs)
    connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nSS-DND
    is a supplementary service which enables a served user to cause the PISN to reject
    any calls, or just those associated with a specified basic service, addressed
    to the served user's PISN number. The calling user is given an indication. Incoming
    calls are rejected as long as the service is active. The served user's outgoing
    service is unaffected.<br />\r\nSS-DNDO is a supplementary service which enables
    a served user to override SS-DND at a called number; that is, to allow the call
    to proceed as if the called user had not activated SS-DND.<br />\r\nThe Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC
    14844:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    14842.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocols for SS-DND(O) operate on top of the signalling
    protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572,
    and use certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary
    services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 14844:2003 also specifies
    additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at
    the Q reference point between SS-DND and other supplementary services and ANFs
    and between SS-DNDO and other supplementary services and ANFs."
