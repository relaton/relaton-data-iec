  content: Applies to sound systems of any kind, and to the parts of which they are
    composed or which are used as auxiliaries to such systems. Deals with the determination
    of the performance of sound system equipment, the comparison of these types of
    equipment and the determination of their proper practical application, by listing
    the characteristics which are useful for their specification and laying down uniform
    methods of measurements for these characteristics. Is confined to a description
    of the different characteristics and the relevant methods of measurement.
