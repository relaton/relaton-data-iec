  content: "IEC TR 60076-26: 2020 which is a Technical Report, provides the functional
    requirements of insulating liquids that are considered necessary for use in power
    transformers, including, for example, reactors and HVDC transformers, are assembled
    and listed. A relevance index of importance for design and for service as well
    as the status of validation is given for all individual requirements (parameters).
    All parameters are assigned to one of the following categories:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>General
    (physical / chemical)</li>\r\n\t<li>Dielectric / Insulation</li>\r\n\t<li>Thermal
    / Cooling</li>\r\n\t<li>Ageing and Stability</li>\r\n\t<li>Liquid-solid system</li>\r\n\t<li>Material
    compatibility</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe document is intended to serve as a general
    reference document for the transformer industry, including liquid suppliers as
    well as relevant scientific and technical bodies dealing with insulating liquids
    (materials)."
