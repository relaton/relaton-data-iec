abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29146:2024 This document defines and establishes a framework for
    access management (AM) and the secure management of the process to access information
    and information and communications technologies (ICT) resources, associated with
    the accountability of a subject within some contexts.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    concepts, terms and definitions applicable to distributed access management techniques
    in network environments.<br />\r\nThis document also provides explanations about
    related architecture, components and management functions.<br />\r\nThe subjects
    involved in access management can be uniquely recognized to access information
    systems, as defined in the ISO/IEC 24760 series.<br />\r\nThe nature and qualities
    of physical access control involved in access management systems are outside the
    scope of this document."
