abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29196:2018 This document consolidates information relating
    to successful, secure and usable implementation of biometric enrolment processes,
    while indicating risk factors that organisations proposing to use biometric technologies
    will should address during procurement, design, deployment and operation. Much
    of the information is generic to many types of application, e.g. from national
    scale commercial and government applications, to closed systems for in-house operations,
    and to consumer applications. However, the intended application and its purpose
    often have influence on the necessary enrolment data quality and are intended
    to be taken into account when specifying an enrolment system and process.<br />\r\nThe
    document points out the differences in operation relating to specific types of
    application, e.g. where self-enrolment is more appropriate than attended operation.
    This document focuses on mandatory, attended enrolment at fixed locations. In
    summary, this document consolidates information relating to better practice implementation
    of biometric enrolment capability in various business contexts including considerations
    of process, function (system), and technology, as well as legal/privacy and policy
    aspects.<br />\r\nThe document provides guidance on collection and storage of
    biometric enrolment data and the impact on dependent processes of verification
    and identification. This document does not include material specific to forensic
    and law enforcement applications.<br />\r\nThis document does not contain any
    mandatory requirements. The following terms are used in this document to provide
    guidance.<br />\r\nThe terms \"should\" and \"should not\" indicate that among
    several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without mentioning
    or excluding others, or that a certain course of action is preferred but not necessarily
    required, or that (in the negative form) a certain possibility or course of action
    is discouraged but not prohibited.<br />\r\nThe term \"may\" indicates a course
    of action permissible within the limits of the publication.<br />\r\nThe terms
    \"can\" and \"cannot\" indicate a possibility and capability, whether material,
    physical or causal."
