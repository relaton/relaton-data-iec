  content: "IEC 61800-3:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61800-3:2017
    specifies electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements for power drive systems
    (PDSs, defined in 3.1). These are adjustable speed AC or DC motor drives. Requirements
    are stated for PDSs with converter input and/or output voltages (line-to-line
    voltage), up to 35 kV AC RMS.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2004 and Amendment 1:2011. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) clarification
    of requirements for the test report, particularly when a number of alternative
    test methods exist;<br />\r\nb) introduction of a more detailed test setup for
    radiated emission measurements, along with the introduction of a 3 m measurement
    distance for small size equipment;<br />\r\nc) general updates in the informative
    annexes."
