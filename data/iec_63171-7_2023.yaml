abstract:
- content: "IEC 63171-7:2023 covers shielded free and fixed circular connectors with
    4 ways up to 7 ways for power and data transmission and specifies the common dimensions,
    mechanical, electrical and transmission characteristics and environmental requirements
    as well as test specifications respectively.<br />\r\nThe connectors described
    in this document are either equipped with an M12 screw-locking mechanism (styles
    with M12 in the name) or a quick-locking push-pull mechanism with a size derived
    from that (styles with P12 in the name) or both mechanisms combined (styles with
    C12 in the name). For the sake of simplicity, the connectors' size is denoted
    as \"size 12\" in this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides multiple mating
    interfaces each of which is associated with a coding preventing the mating of
    incompatible male and female connectors. These codings are referred to as \"Type
    x\", where \"x\" is represented by a Roman numeral.<br />\r\nFor all codings,
    two ways and the additional shield pin, which is intended to be connected to the
    cable screen, support differential data transmission with frequencies up to 600
    MHz by meeting the requirements of Category B, as defined in IEC 63171."
