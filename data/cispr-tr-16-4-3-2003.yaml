    This technical report contains recommendations on statistics of disturbance complaints, on the significance of CISPR limits, and specific reports.

    Over the years, the CISPR prepared a number of recommendations and reports that have significant technical merit but were not generally available. Reports and recommendations were for some time published in CISPR 7 and 8.

    At its meeting in Campinas, Brazil, in 1988, subcommittee A agreed on the table of contents of the first edition of part 3 and to publish the reports for posterity by giving the reports a permanent place in part 3. In 2003, the relevant clauses on statistics were transferred to CISPR 16-4-3.

    CISPR 16-3 has been reorganised into 4 parts, to accommodate growth and easier maintenance. This first edition of CISPR 16-4-3, together with CISPR 16-4-1, CISPR 16-4-4 and the second edition of CISPR 16-3, cancels and replaces the first  edition  of CISPR 16-3, published in  2000, and its amendment 1 (2002). It contains the relevant clauses of CISPR 16-3 without technical changes.
