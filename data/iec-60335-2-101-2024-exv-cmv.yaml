  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-101:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-101:2024 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-101:2024 deals with the safety of electric vaporizers
    for household and similar use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including
    direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples
    of appliances that are within the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n- air fresheners;<br
    />\r\n- insect repellers.<br />\r\nThey can be plugged directly into a socket-outlet
    or connected to the supply mains by means of a flexible cord and plug.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laypersons in
    shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances to be used in vehicles or on board ships or
    aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- appliances for heating liquids (IEC
    60335-2-15);<br />\r\n- insect killers (IEC 60335-2-59);<br />\r\n- fabric steamers
    (IEC 60335-2-85);<br />\r\n- humidifiers (IEC 60335-2-98).<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008
    and Amendment 2:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1);<br />\r\nc) application of test
    probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 8.1.3, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd)
    addition of external accessible surface temperatures (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
