abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 7501-1:2005 is a short form endorsement of specific parts of the
    International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Doc 9303 Part 1 - Machine Readable
    Passports. ICAO Doc 9303 specifies the form and provides guidance on the construction
    of machine readable passports (MRPs), in particular in relation to those aspects
    of the MRP where details of the rightful holder are presented in a form which
    is both visually and machine readable.The edition of the International Civil Aviation
    Organization (ICAO) Document; i.e. Doc 9303 Part 1 - Machine Readable Passports,
    Section III, Technical Specifications which was adopted as ISO/IEC 7501-1:1997
    is now out of date and in the process of being revised. Once the new edition of
    Doc 9303 Part 1 - Machine Readable Passports is finalized by the TAG/MRTD, ISO/IEC
    JTC 1 will undertake its consideration for endorsement as a new fifth edition
    of ISO/IEC 7501-1.
