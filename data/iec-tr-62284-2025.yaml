  content: "IEC TR 62284:2025 which is a Technical Report, applies to single-mode
    optical fibres. Its object is to document the methods for measuring the effective
    area (Aeff) of these fibres. It defines three methods of measuring Aeff. Information
    common to all the methods is found in the body of this document. Information specific
    to each method is found in the annexes. The three methods are:<br />\r\na) direct
    far-field (DFF);<br />\r\nb) variable aperture in the far-field (VAMFF);<br />\r\nc)
    near-field (NF).<br />\r\nThe reference method, used to resolve disputes, is method
    A, direct far-field.<br />\r\nEffective area is an optical attribute that is specified
    for single-mode fibres and used in system designs probably affected by the non-linear
    refractive index coefficient, n2. There is agreement in both national and international
    standards bodies concerning the definition used in this document. Methods A, B,
    and C have been recognised as providing equivalent results, provided that good
    engineering is used in implementation.<br />\r\nThe direct far-field is the reference
    method because it is the most direct method and is named as the reference method
    for mode field diameter in IEC 60793-1-45 and ITU-T Recommendation G.650.1.<br
    />\r\nA mapping function is a formula by which the measured results of one attribute
    are used to predict the value of another attribute on a given fibre. For a given
    fibre type and design, the mode field diameter (MFD) (IEC 60793-1-45) can be used
    to predict the effective area with a mapping function. A mapping function is specific
    to a particular fibre type and design. Mapping functions are generated by doing
    an experiment in which a sample of fibre is chosen to represent the spectrum of
    values of MFD and in which the fibres in the sample are measured for both MFD
    and Aeff. Linear regression can be used to determine the fitting coefficient,
    k, as defined by the following:<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Other mathematical models can
    be used if they are generally more accurate.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 See Annex E for more
    information.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) improvement of the description of measurement details
    for B-657 fibre;<br />\r\nb) modification of the minimum distance between the
    fibre end and the detector for the direct far field scan (Annex A);<br />\r\nc)
    deletion of Annex H."
