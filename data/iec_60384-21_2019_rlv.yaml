abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-21:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60384-21:2019 is applicable
    to fixed unencapsulated surface mount multilayer capacitors of ceramic dielectric,
    Class 1, for use in electronic equipment. These capacitors have metallized connecting
    pads or soldering strips and are intended to be mounted on printed boards, or
    directly onto substrates for hybrid circuits. Capacitors for electromagnetic interference
    suppression are not included, but are covered by IEC 60384-14. The object of this
    document is to prescribe preferred ratings and characteristics and to select from
    IEC 60384-1 the appropriate quality assessment procedures, tests and measuring
    methods and to give general performance requirements for this type of capacitor.
    Test severities and requirements prescribed in detail specifications referring
    to this sectional specification are of equal or higher performance levels; lower
    performance levels are not permitted. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of
    the structure in accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2016 to the extent
    practicable, and for harmonizing with IEC 60384-22;<br />\r\n- deletion of the
    description on the permissible reactive power in 6.2.2 because it is not appropriate
    for the purposes of this document;<br />\r\n- the dimensions of 0201M in Annex
    A have been added.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"></ol>"
