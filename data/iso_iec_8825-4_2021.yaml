abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of basic XML Encoding Rules (BASIC-XER)
    that may be used to derive a transfer syntax for values of types defined in Rec.
    ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1 and Rec. ITU-T X.681 | ISO/IEC 8824-2. This document
    also specifies a set of Canonical XML Encoding Rules (CXER) which provide constraints
    on the basic XML Encoding Rules and produce a unique encoding for any given ASN.1
    value. This document further specifies a set of extended XML Encoding Rules (EXTENDED-XER)
    which adds further encoders options, and also allows the ASN.1 specifier to vary
    the encoding that would be produced by BASIC-XER. It is implicit in the specification
    of these encoding rules that they are also used for decoding.</p><p>The encoding
    rules specified in this document:</p><p>– are used at the time of communication;</p><p>–
    are intended for use in circumstances where displaying of values and/or processing
    them using commonly available XML tools (such as browsers) is the major concern
    in the choice of encoding rules;</p><p>– allow the extension of an abstract syntax
    by addition of extra values for all forms of extensibility described in Rec. ITU-T
    X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824‑1.</p><p>This document also specifies the syntax and semantics
    of XER encoding instructions, and the rules for their assignment and combination.
    XER encoding instructions can be used to control the EXTENDED-XER encoding for
    specific ASN.1 types.</p>"
