abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23001-17:2024 This document specifies how uncompressed 2D image
    and video data is carried in files in the family of standards based on the ISO
    base media file format (ISO/IEC 14496-12). This includes but is not limited to
    monochromatic data, colour data, transparency (alpha) information and depth information.<br
    />\r\nThe primary goal of this document is to allow exchange of uncompressed video
    and image data while relying on the information set provided by the ISO base media
    file format, such as timing, colour space and sample aspect ratio to specify the
    interpretation and/or display of video and image data."
