abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62396-3:2008(E) provides guidance to those involved in the design
    of avionic systems and equipment and the resultant affects of atmospheric radiation
    induced Single Event Effects (SEE) on those avionic systems. The outputs of the
    activities and objectives described in this Technical Specification will become
    inputs to higher level certification activities and required evidences. It builds
    on the initial guidance on the system level approach to SEE in IEC/TS 62396-1,
    considers some avionic systems and provides basic methods to accommodate SEE so
    that system development assurance levels may be met.
