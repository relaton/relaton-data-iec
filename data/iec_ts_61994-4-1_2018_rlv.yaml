    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61994-4-1:2018
    gives the terms and definition for synthetic quartz crystals representing the
    state of the art, which are intended for manufacturing piezoelectric and optical
    elements. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The new terms and definitions given
    in IEC 60758:2016 have been taken into account;<br />\r\n- The general title has
