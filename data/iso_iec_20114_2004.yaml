abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20114:2004 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Make Call
    Request supplementary service (SS-MCR) at the Q reference point between Private
    Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private
    Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nSupplementary service MCR enables
    a Requesting User to request a Co-operating User to establish a new Requested
    Call to a Destination User. This new Requested Call between the Co-operating and
    Destination User can be either a Basic call or a Call Independent Signalling Connection.<br
    />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300
    387. ISO/IEC 20114:2004 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 20113.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-MCR operates on top
    of the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified
    in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control
    of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 20114:2004
    also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of
    interactions at the Q reference point between SS-MCR and other supplementary services
    and ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 20114:2004 is applicable to PINXs, which can interconnect
    to form a PISN."
