abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document specifies entity
    authentication mechanisms using authenticated encryption algorithms. Four of the
    mechanisms provide entity authentication between two entities where no trusted
    third party is involved; two of these are mechanisms to unilaterally authenticate
    one entity to another, while the other two are mechanisms for mutual authentication
    of two entities. The remaining mechanisms require an on-line trusted third party
    for the establishment of a common secret key. They also realize mutual or unilateral
    entity authentication.</p><p>Annex A defines Object Identifiers for the mechanisms
    specified in this document.</p>
