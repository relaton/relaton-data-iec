abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies entity authentication mechanisms using authenticated
    encryption algorithms. Four of the mechanisms provide entity authentication between
    two entities where no trusted third party is involved; two of these are mechanisms
    to unilaterally authenticate one entity to another, while the other two are mechanisms
    for mutual authentication of two entities. The remaining mechanisms require an
    on-line trusted third party for the establishment of a common secret key. They
    also realize mutual or unilateral entity authentication.</p><p>Annex A defines
    Object Identifiers for the mechanisms specified in this document.</p>"
