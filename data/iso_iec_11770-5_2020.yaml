abstract:
- content: "This document specifies mechanisms to establish shared symmetric keys
    between groups of entities. It defines:<br />\r\n- symmetric key-based key establishment
    mechanisms for multiple entities with a key distribution centre (KDC); and<br
    />\r\n- symmetric key establishment mechanisms based on a general tree-based logical
    key structure with both individual rekeying and batch rekeying.<br />\r\nIt also
    defines key establishment mechanisms based on a key chain with group forward secrecy,
    group backward secrecy or both group forward and backward secrecy.<br />\r\nThis
    document also describes the required content of messages which carry keying material
    or are necessary to set up the conditions under which the keying material can
    be established.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify information that has no
    relation with key establishment mechanisms, nor does it specify other messages
    such as error messages. The explicit format of messages is not within the scope
    of this document.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify the means to be used
    to establish the initial secret keys required to be shared between each entity
    and the KDC, nor key lifecycle management. This document also does not explicitly
    address the issue of interdomain key management."
