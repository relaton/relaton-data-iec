  content: "IEC 62769-5:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62769-5:2023
    defines the FDI®[1] Information Model. One of the main tasks of the Information
    Model is to reflect the topology of the automation system. Therefore, it represents
    the devices of the automation system as well as the connecting communication networks
    including their properties, relationships, and the operations that can be performed
    on them. The types in the AddressSpace of the FDI® Server constitute some kind
    of catalogue, which is built from FDI® Packages. The fundamental types for the
    FDI® Information Model are well defined in OPC UA for Devices (IEC 62541‑100).
    The FDI® Information Model specifies extensions for a few special cases and otherwise
    explains how these types are used and how the contents are built from elements
    of DevicePackages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[1] FDI® is a registered trademark of the
    non-profit organization Fieldbus Foundation, Inc. This information is given for
    the convenience of users of this document and does not constitute an endorsement
