abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-7:2011 defines data formats to facilitate communications
    between radio frequency identification (RFID) systems and smart RFID tags with
    integral transducers (sensors and actuators). It defines new Transducer Electronic
    Data Sheet (TEDS) formats based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451 series of standards.
    It also defines a command structure and specifies the communication methods with
    which the command structure is designed to be compatible.</p>"
