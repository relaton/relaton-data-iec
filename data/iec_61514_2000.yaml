abstract:
- content: "IEC 61514:2000 specifies tests designed to determine the static and dynamic
    performance of single-acting or double-acting valve positioners. The tests may
    be applied to positioners which receive standard analogue input signals (as specified
    in IEC 60381 and IEC 60382) and have a pneumatic output.<br />\r\nNOTE For positioners
    with pulsed or digital input signals, equivalent criteria may be applied. The
    methods described may not fully apply to positioners with digital controllers
    or positioners with pulsed outputs.<br />\r\nTesting may be conducted either on
    a positioner alone, independently of an actuator, or on a positioner mounted and
    connected to a specific actuator, as a combined unit. The text makes clear where
    different approaches are required. The methods of evaluation given in this standard
    are intended for use by manufacturers to determine the performance of their products,
    and by users, or independent testing establishments, to verify manufacturers'
    performance specifications. This publication is to be read in conjunction with
    IEC 61514-2:2013."
