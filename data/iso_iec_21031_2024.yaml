abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 21031:2024 This document describes a methodology for calculating
    the rate of carbon emissions for a software system; that is, its SCI score. The
    purpose of this score is to increase awareness and transparency of an application's
    sustainability credentials. The score will help software practitioners make better,
    evidence-based decisions during system design, development, and deployment, that
    will ultimately minimize carbon emissions. A reliable, consistent, fair and comparable
    measure allows targets to be defined during development and progress to be tracked.
