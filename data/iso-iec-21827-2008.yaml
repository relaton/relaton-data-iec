    <p>ISO/IEC 21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability Maturity Model® (SSE-CMM®), which describes the essential characteristics of an organization's security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security engineering. ISO/IEC 21827:2008 does not prescribe a particular process or sequence, but captures practices generally observed in industry. The model is a standard metric for security engineering practices covering the following: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>the entire life cycle, including development, operation, maintenance and decommissioning activities;</li>
    <li>the whole organization, including management, organizational and engineering activities;</li>
    <li>concurrent interactions with other disciplines, such as system, software, hardware, human factors and test engineering; system management, operation and maintenance;</li>
    <li>interactions with other organizations, including acquisition, system management, certification, accreditation and evaluation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The objective is to facilitate an increase of maturity of the security engineering processes within the organization. The SSE-CMM® is related to other CMMs which focus on different engineering disciplines and topic areas and can be used in combination or conjunction with them.</p>
