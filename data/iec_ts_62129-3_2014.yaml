abstract:
- content: 'IEC TS 62129-3:2014, which is a technical specification, describes the
    calibration of optical frequency meters. It is applicable to instruments measuring
    the optical frequency emitted from sources that are typical for the fibre-optic
    communications industry. It is assumed that the optical radiation will be coupled
    to the optical frequency meter by a single-mode optical fibre. Keywords: calibration
    of optical frequency meters, single-mode optical fibre'
