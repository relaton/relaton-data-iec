  content: "IEC 60794-3-12:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-3-12:2021
    is a detailed specification for duct and directly buried optical telecommunication
    cables for use in premises cabling to ensure compatibility with ISO/IEC 11801-1.
    This document's requirements ensure that the ISO/IEC 11801-1 models work for generic
    cabling and system performances. Values in this document support these models.
    The requirements of the family specification IEC 60794-3-10 are applicable to
    cables covered by this document. Particular requirements detailed in Clause 5
    either define a specific option relative to the requirements of IEC 60794-3-10
    or define additional requirements. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of references to ISO/IEC 11801-1;<br
    />\r\n- removal of references to ISO/IEC 24702;<br />\r\n- incorporation of the
    OM5 cabled fibre performance category;<br />\r\n- incorporation of the OS1a cabled
    fibre performance category;<br />\r\n- cabled fibre performance categories OM1,
    OM2 and OS1 are no longer normative, and are retained for information."
