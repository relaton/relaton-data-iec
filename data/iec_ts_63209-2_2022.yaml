abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63209-2:2022 includes a menu of tests to use for evaluation of the
    long-term reliability of materials used as backsheets and encapsulants in PV modules.
    It is intended to provide information to supplement the baseline testing defined
    in IEC 61215 and IEC 61730, which are qualification tests with pass-fail criteria.
    used for reliability analysis and is not intended to be used as a pass-fail test
    procedure. This document addresses polymeric materials in the crystalline silicon
    module laminates, specifically backsheets and encapsulants in Glass/Glass or Glass/Backsheet
    modules. The included environmental stress tests are intended to cause degradation
    that is most relevant to field experience, but these may not capture all failure
    modes which may be observed in various locations.
