abstract:
- content: IEC 62481-6-1:2017(E) specifies guidelines that define HTML5 Remote User
    Interface (RUI-H). HTML5 allows operators to develop &quot;write once, play anywhere&quot;
    content applications across a broad range of browsers and platforms. Through native
    integration, HTML5 enables the repurposing of single codebases, resulting in reduced
    development costs and the provision of a unique UI for every device.
