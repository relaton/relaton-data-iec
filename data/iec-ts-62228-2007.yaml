  content: 'Specifies test and measurement methods, test conditions, test setups,
    test procedures, failure criteria and test signals for the EMC evaluation of CAN
    transceivers concerning: - immunity against RF common mode disturbances on the
    signal lines - emissions caused by non-symmetrical signals regarding the time
    and frequency domain - immunity against transients (function and damage) - immunity
    against electrostatic discharges - ESD (damage)'
