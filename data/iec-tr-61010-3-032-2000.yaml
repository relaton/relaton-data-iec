  content: 'A technical report for use by test houses and other users. It assists
    them with determining and recording verification of conformity of the equipment
    under test with the requirements of IEC 61010-2-031 (1994). If the paper version
    of the report is ordered, a diskette is provided with fill-in tables for recording
    the test results. If the report is downloaded directly from the web, it consists
    of two files: the technical report as a ZIP file and the fill-in tables as a WORD
    file.'
