abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-27:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine the key control characteristic<br />\r\n• field-effect
    mobility<br />\r\nfor semiconducting two-dimensional (2D) materials by the<br
    />\r\n• field-effect transistor (FET) method.<br />\r\nFor two-dimensional semiconducting
    materials, the field-effect mobility is determined by fabricating a FET test structure
    and measuring the transconductance in a four-terminal configuration.<br />\r\n-
    This method can be applied to layers of semiconducting two-dimensional materials,
    such as graphene, black phosphorus (BP), molybdenum disulfide (MoS₂), molybdenum
    ditelluride (MoTe₂), tungsten disulfide (WS₂), and tungsten diselenide (WSe₂).<br
    />\r\n- The four-terminal configuration improves accuracy by eliminating parasitic
    effects from the probe contacts and cables"
