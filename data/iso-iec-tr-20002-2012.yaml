    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20002:2012:</p>
    <p>a) classifies problems of P2P networking;</p>
    <p>b) defines taxonomy and concept of managed P2P; </p>
    <p>c) specifies requirements to support managed P2P;</p>
    <p>d) specifies framework for managed P2P; </p>
    <p>e) specifies information flows to support various features of managed P2P.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 20002:2012 does not define new P2P protocol or P2P-based applications. ISO/IEC TR 20002:2012 does not define manageability features for interoperation with conventional P2P-based applications. The goal of ISO/IEC TR 20002:2012 is to define a framework to provide manageability to the conventional P2P-based application.</p>
