    <p>The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a description of a mechanism for transferring</p>
    <p>information between modelling tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing and</p>
    <p>exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform to CDIF.</p>
    <p>The CDIF family of standards includes a semantic metamodel and a transfer format definition. It also includes the</p>
    <p>specification of a meta-metamodel and associated rules that define a framework for the semantic metamodel and</p>
    <p>the transfer format. The language that is defined for the transfer format also has applicability as a general language</p>
    <p>for Import/Export for repositories. The CDIF semantic metamodel also has applicability as the basis of standard</p>
    <p>definitions for use in repositories.</p>
    <p>The standards that form the complete family of CDIF Standards are documented in ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002<i>,</i></p>
    <p><i>Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 1: Overview</i>. These standards cover the overall framework, the</p>
    <p>transfer format and the CDIF semantic metamodel.</p>

    <p/>
    <p><b>Figure 1 </b>− <b>CDIF family of standards</b></p>
    <p>The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the various standards that comprise the CDIF family of standards. The shaded box</p>
    <p>depicts this Standard and its position in the CDIF family of standards.</p>
    <p>This document (ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002<i>, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 2: Modelling and</i></p>
    <p><i>extensibility</i>) includes the definition of the CDIF meta-metamodel and describes the rules and notations used</p>
    <p>throughout the CDIF family of standards. The rules for extending the CDIF semantic metamodel are also defined.</p>
    <p>This document is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document provides</p>
    <p>an introduction to the entire CDIF family of standards. It is suitable for:</p>
    <p> Those evaluating CDIF,</p>
    <p> Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and</p>
    <p> Those developing importers and exporters.</p>
    <p>The document, ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002<i>, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 1: Overview, </i>and this</p>
    <p>framework document ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002<i>, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 2: Modelling and</i></p>
    <p><i>extensibility</i>, should be read first when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read other documents in the</p>
    <p>CDIF family of standards.</p>
    <p>While there are no specific prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful for the reader to have familiarity</p>
    <p>with the following:</p>
    <p> Entity-Relationship-Attribute modelling;</p>
    <p> Modelling (CASE) tools;</p>
    <p> Information repositories;</p>
    <p> Data dictionaries;</p>
    <p> Multiple meta-layer modelling.</p>
