abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 24753:2011 defines a minimum
    application protocol to support sensors and the monitoring of batteries in conjunction
    with RFID tags utilizing the air interface as defined in the ISO/IEC 18000 series.</p><p>It
    provides common encoding rules for identifying sensors, their functions, and their
    delivered measurements. It also defines the process rules to support the following
    functions:</p><ul><li>selecting and de-selecting a particular sensory function
    when more than one is supported by the RFID tag;</li><li>setting sensor parameters
    both initially and ongoing;</li><li>starting and stopping the monitoring function
    of a sensor;</li><li>accessing sensor data; and</li><li>carrying out basic processing
    of sensor data and interpreting this into a format that is meaningful for an application.</li></ul>
