abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24753:2011 defines a minimum application protocol to support
    sensors and the monitoring of batteries in conjunction with RFID tags utilizing
    the air interface as defined in the ISO/IEC 18000 series.</p><p>It provides common
    encoding rules for identifying sensors, their functions, and their delivered measurements.
    It also defines the process rules to support the following functions:</p><ul><li>selecting
    and de-selecting a particular sensory function when more than one is supported
    by the RFID tag;</li><li>setting sensor parameters both initially and ongoing;</li><li>starting
    and stopping the monitoring function of a sensor;</li><li>accessing sensor data;
    and</li><li>carrying out basic processing of sensor data and interpreting this
    into a format that is meaningful for an application.</li></ul>"
