  content: "IEC 61010-2-202:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-202:2020
    constitutes Part 2-202 of a planned series of standards on industrial-process
    measurement, control and automation equipment. Safety terms of general use are
    defined in IEC 61010-1. More specific terms are defined in each part. This part
    incorporates the safety related requirements of electrically operated valve ACTUATORs
    and SOLENOIDs. This document does not cover functional safety aspects of electrically
    operated ACTUATORs and SOLENOIDs."
