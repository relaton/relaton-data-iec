  content: "IEC 60034-14:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-14:2018
    specifies the factory acceptance vibration test procedures and vibration limits
    for certain electrical machines under specified conditions, when uncoupled from
    any load or prime mover. It is applicable to DC and three-phase AC machines, with
    shaft heights 56 mm and higher and a rated output up to 50 MW, at operational
    speeds from 120 min–1 up to and including 15 000 min–1. This new edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- Improved explanation of the definition “free suspension”.<br />\r\n- Addition
    of an alternative method of rigid mount<br />\r\n- Definition of an improved option
    for shaft key."
