  content: "IEC/TS 62224:2013(E) explains the conceptual model of the protocol specification
    to exchange license information between DRM modules. This Technical Specification
    also outlines which models should be defined as standard models as well as the
    standard meanings (mainly from the viewpoint of information security in the environment,
    including home server systems). This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2007 and constitutes a technical revision. It includes the
    following technical changes:<br />\r\n- the Diffie-Hellman method concerning Secure
    license transaction protocol (SLTP) model has been added,<br />\r\n- the Protected
    Content Format (PCF) model which is dependent on each service has been deleted,<br
    />\r\n- a description related to IEC 62227 has been added,<br />\r\n- the classification
    of certification authority has been added."
