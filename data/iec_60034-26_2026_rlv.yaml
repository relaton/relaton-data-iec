abstract:
- content: "IEC 60034-26:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60034-26:2026
    describes the effects of unbalanced voltages on the performance of three-phase
    cage induction motors. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) clarification that voltages are line-to-line voltages
    in Clause 4, Annex A and Annex B;<br />\r\nb) addition of design NE according
    to IEC 60034-12 in Clause 4."
