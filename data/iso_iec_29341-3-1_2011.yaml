abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29341-3-1:2011(E) describes the overall UPnP AV Architecture, which
    forms the foundation for the UPnP AV Device and Service templates. The AV Architecture
    defines the general interaction between UPnP Control Points and UPnP AV devices.
    It is independent of any particular device type, content format, and transfer
    protocol. It supports a variety of devices such as TVs, VCRs, CD/DVD players/jukeboxes,
    settop boxes, stereos systems, MP3 players, still-image cameras, camcorders, electronic
    picture frames (EPFs), and the PC. The AV Architecture allows devices to support
    different types of formats for the entertainment content (such as MPEG2, MPEG4,
    JPEG, MP3, Windows Media Architecture (WMA), bitmaps (BMP), NTSC, PAL, ATSC, etc.)
    and multiple types of transfer protocols (such as IEC- 61883/IEEE-1394, HTTP GET,
    RTP, HTTP PUT/POST, TCP/IP, etc.). This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC
    29341-3-1, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision.
