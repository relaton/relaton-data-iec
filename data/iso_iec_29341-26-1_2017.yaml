abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-1:2017 describes an architecture that allows UPnP Telephony
    devices, services and control points defined in the propoded DCP to be deployed
    in the home network environment and to enable management of incoming and outgoing
    telephony calls, messaging, presence information and phone features configuration
    through UPnP means from devices within the home.</p><p>In order to accommodate
    the above mentioned goals, the Telephony Architecture defines several UPnP devices
    and services that can be embedded to the devices defined for telephony. The architecture
    model describes interaction among the telephony devices, services and control
    points. The architecture also describes various deployment scenarios.</p><p>The
    architecture does not describe any interfaces to "service" gateways that will
    enable non-UPnP entities to interact with the UPnP devices, services and control
    points physically attached to the home network.</p>
