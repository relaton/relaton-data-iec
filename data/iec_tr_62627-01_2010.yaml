abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62627-01:2010(E) is intended to emphasize the need for cleaning
    fibre optic connections as well as describing some of the current tools and methods
    available for proper cleaning. In addition, the report includes a definition of
    practices that are not recommended. This technical report explains the need to
    visually inspect plug endfaces but it does not address the inspection criteria,
    which are covered in another standard.
