  content: "IEC TR 63362-1:2022(E) establishes guidelines for the application and
    use of aluminium electrolytic capacitors in electronic equipment.<br />\r\nThe
    information given in this document applies to capacitors with non-solid electrolyte
    but can, in its appropriate clauses, apply to capacitors with solid electrolyte
    as well.<br />\r\nElectrolytic capacitors in general – and aluminium electrolytic
    capacitors in particular – are an exception in the capacitor field because of
    the components’ close interaction of physics and chemistry. Therefore, aluminium
    electrolytic capacitors show, in various aspects, a technical behaviour unaccustomed
    to the user. That could easily lead to misapplications and even to endangering
    of persons and goods. The aim of this document is to minimize these risks by providing
    detailed information on the specific peculiarities of the component.<br />\r\nThis
    first edition cancels and replaces CLC/TR 50454 published in 2008. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\nComplete
    technical revision, details of cleaning processes and failure modes added.<br
    />\r\nInclusion of parts of JEITA RCR 2367D."
