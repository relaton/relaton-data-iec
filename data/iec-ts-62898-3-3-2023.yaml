  content: "IEC TS 62898-3-3:2023 deals with frequency and voltage stabilization of
    AC microgrids by dispatchable loads, which react autonomously on variations of
    frequency and voltage with a change in active power consumption. Both 50 Hz and
    60 Hz electric power systems are covered. This document gives requirements to
    emulate the self-regulation effect of loads including synthetic inertia.<br />\r\nThe
    loads recommended for this approach are noncritical loads, this means their power
    modulation will not significantly affect the user as some kind of energy storage
    is involved which effectively decouples end energy use from the electricity supply
    by the electric network. The self-regulation of loads is beneficial both in island
    mode and grid-connected mode. This document gives the details of the self-regulation
    behaviour but does not stipulate which loads shall participate in this approach
    as an optional function.<br />\r\nThis document covers both continuously controllable
    loads with droop control and ON/OFF switchable loads with staged settings. The
    scope of this document is limited to loads connected to the voltage level up to
    35 kV. Reactive power for voltage stabilization and DC microgrids are excluded
    in this document."
