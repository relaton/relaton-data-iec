abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-47:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-47:2017
    establishes uniform requirements for measuring the macrobending loss of single-mode
    fibres (class B) at 1 550 nm or 1 625 nm, category A1 multimode fibres at 850
    nm or 1 300 nm, and category A3 and A4 multimode fibres at 650 nm, 850 nm or 1
    300 nm, thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables for commercial
    purposes. This document gives two methods for measuring macrobending sensitivity:<br
    />\r\n- Method A – Fibre winding, pertains to class B single-mode fibres and category
    A1 multimode fibres.<br />\r\n- Method B – Quarter circle bends, pertains to category
    A3 and A4 multimode fibres.<br />\r\nFor both of these methods, the macrobending
    loss can be measured utilizing general fibre attenuation techniques, for example
    the power monitoring technique (see Annex A) or the cut‑back technique (see Annex
    B). Methods A and B are expected to produce different results if they are applied
    to the same fibre. This is because the key difference between the two methods
    is the deployment, including the bend radius and length of fibre that is bent.
    The reason for the difference is that A3 and A4 multimode fibres are expected
    to be deployed in short lengths with a smaller number of bends per unit fiber
    length compared to single-mode and category A1 multimode fibres. In this document,
    the \"curvature radius\" is defined as the radius of the suitable circular shaped
    support (e.g. mandrel or guiding groove on a flat surface) on which the fibre
    can be bent. In addition, informative Annex E has been added to approximate bend
    loss for class B single-mode fibres across a broad wavelength range at various
    effective bends. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2009. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    former Annex A has been renumbered to Annex D;<br />\r\n- introduction of new
    Annex A on the transmitted power monitoring technique;<br />\r\n- introduction
    of Annex B on the cut-back technique;<br />\r\n- introduction of Annex C on the
    requirements for the optical source characteristics of A1 multimode measurement;<br
    />\r\n- introduction of Annex E on parallel plate (2-point) macrobend loss approximation.<br
    /><br />\r\nKeywords: macrobending loss of single-mode fibers"
