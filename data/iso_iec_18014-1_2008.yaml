abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18014 specifies time-stamping techniques. It consists of three
    parts, which include the general notion, models for a time-stamping service, data
    structures, and protocols.ISO/IEC 18014-1:2008 describes a framework and defines
    the basic notion, the data structures, and protocols which are used for any time-stamping
    technique.ISO/IEC 18014-1:2008:identifies the objective of a time-stamping authority;describes
    a general model on which time-stamping services are based;describes a process
    of generating and verifying time-stamp;defines the data structures of time-stamp
    token;defines the basic protocols of time-stamping;specifies the protocols between
