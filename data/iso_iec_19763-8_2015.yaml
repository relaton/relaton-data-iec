abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    primary purpose of the multipart standard ISO/IEC 19763 is to specify a metamodel
    framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC 19763-7:2015 specifies a metamodel for
    registering models of services, facilitating interoperability through the reuse
    of services.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19763-7:2015 is only applicable to web services
    whose capabilities are described by some web service description language (see
    Annex A for examples of such languages). Figure 1 shows the scope of ISO/IEC 19763â€‘7:2015."
