abstract:
- content: "IEC 62106:2015(E) describes the Radio Data System, RDS, intended for application
    to VHF/FM sound broadcasts in the range 87,5 MHz to 108,0 MHz which may carry
    either stereophonic (pilot-tone system) or monophonic programmes (as stated in
    ITU-R Recommendation BS 450-3 and ITU-R Recommendation BS.643-3). The main objectives
    of RDS are to enable improved functionality for FM receivers and to make them
    more user-friendly by using features such as Programme Identification, Programme
    Service name display and, where applicable, automatic tuning for portable and
    car radios, in particular. The relevant basic tuning and switching information
    therefore has to be implemented by the type 0 group (see 6.1.5.1), and it is not
    optional unlike many of the other possible features in RDS. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2009 and constitutes a technical
    revision. It includes the following changes:<br />\r\n- for the RDS feature EON
    and the use of group types 14A and 14B some additional explanations were added;<br
    />\r\n- in Annex E, containing the character code tables to be used in RDS, the
    explanation for Table E.1 and Table E.2 was extended;<br />\r\n- several small
    typing errors were corrected;<br />\r\n- to Enhanced RadioText in Annex Q an additional
    explanation was added."
