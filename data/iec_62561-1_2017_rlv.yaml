abstract:
- content: "IEC 62561-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62561-1:2017
    specifies the requirements and tests for metallic connection components that form
    part of a lightning protection system (LPS). Typically, these can be connectors,
    clamps, bonding and bridging components, expansion pieces and test joints.<br
    />\r\nFor the purposes of this document the following connection types are considered
    as connection components: exothermic, brazing, welding, clamping, crimping, seaming,
    screwing or bolting. Testing of components for an explosive atmosphere is not
    covered by this document.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition, published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. classification of connection components in
    permanent and non-permanent connection;<br />\r\nb. requirements and corresponding
    tests for permanent connection components such as exothermic, brazing, welding,
    crimping, seaming;<br />\r\nc. flow chart of tests for connection components."
