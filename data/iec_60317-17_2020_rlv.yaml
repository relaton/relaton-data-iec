abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-17:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60317-17:2020
    specifies the requirements of enamelled rectangular copper winding wires of class
    105 with a sole coating based on polyvinyl acetal resin, which can be modified
    provided it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all
    specified wire requirements<br />\r\nNOTE 1 A modified resin is a resin that has
    undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives to enhance certain
    performance or application characteristics.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Polyvinyl acetate
    is a general name for a family of thermoplastic vinyl resins produced by the condensation
    of polyvinyl alcohol with an aldehyde. Examples are polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl
    formal and polyvinyl butyral. The range of nominal conductor dimensions covered
    by this document is:<br />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm max. 31,5 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness:
    min. 0,80 mm max. 10,00 mm.<br />\r\nWires of grade 1 and grade 2 are included
    in this specification and apply to the complete range of conductors. The specified
    combinations of width and thickness as well as the specified ratio of width/thickness
    are given in IEC 60317-0-2. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- modification of the Scope (Clause 1);<br />\r\n-
    renaming of stretching test to adherence test and a modification of the requirement
    in 8.2."
