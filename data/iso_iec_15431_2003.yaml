abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15431:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Wireless terminal call handling additional network features (ANF-WTMI and
    ANF-WTMO) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN).</p><p>ANF-WTMI is a feature that directs incoming calls to a WTMI user
    within the PISN regardless of the WTMI user's geographical location within the
    PISN, provided that the WTMI user's location is known. Roaming outside the PISN
    is outside the scope of this edition of this International Standard.</p><p>ANF-WTMO
    permits the PISN to process call requests from a WTMO user at the home location,
    if required.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service
    specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified
    in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification
    for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage
    1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15430.</p><p>The signalling protocol for
    ANF-WTMI and ANF-WTMO operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit
    switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects
    of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15431:2003 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between ANF-WTMI / ANF-WTMO and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15431:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
