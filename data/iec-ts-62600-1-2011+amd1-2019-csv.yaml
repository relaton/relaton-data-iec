  content: IEC TS 62600-1:2011+A1:2019 defines the terms relevant to ocean and marine
    renewable energy. For the purposes of this Technical Specification, sources of
    ocean and marine renewable energy are taken to include wave, tidal current, and
    other water current energy converters. This Technical Specification is intended
    to provide uniform terminology to facilitate communication between organizations
    and individuals in the marine renewable energy industry and those who interact
    with them. <strong>This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2011)
    and its amendment 1 (2019). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong>
