    Gives guidance on the selection, installation and maintenance of electrical apparatus protected by enclosures and surface temperature limitation for use in areas where combustible dust may be present in quantities which could lead to a fire or explosion hazard.
    Note - IEC 61241-1-1 specifies requirements for the design, construction and testing of electrical apparatus.  Apparatus within the scope of this standard may also be subject to additional requirements in other standards - for example IEC 60079-0.
