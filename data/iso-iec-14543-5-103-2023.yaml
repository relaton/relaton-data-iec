  content: "ISO/IEC 14543-5-103:2023 (E) specifies the application framework, device
    interaction process, request and response message formats and service description
    requirements to achieve intelligent grouping, resource sharing and service collaboration
    among various audio devices and controllers.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to many types of audio devices with network connection capability. Networked audio
    devices can include a multi-room home audio system, a high-fidelity audio system,
    a home theatre, a smart radio, background audio, mobile audio and public audio
    equipment. Services specified by this document enable smart audio interconnection
    applications to interoperate seamlessly among audio devices and resource servers
    at home, in an office or in other remote environments. These services can include
    multi-device synchronization, sound configuration, audio on-demand service and
    music streaming and rendering."
