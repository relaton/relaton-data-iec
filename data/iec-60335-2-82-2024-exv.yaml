  content: "IEC 60335-2-82:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-82:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-82:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric commercial amusement machines and personal service machines, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V
    for other appliances, including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within the scope of this
    standard are<br />\r\n– amusement machines: billiard tables, bowling machines,
    dartboards, driving simulators, gaming machines, kiddie rides, laser shooting
    appliances, pinball machines, video games<br />\r\n– personal service machines:
    card re-value machines, currency dispensers, luggage lockers, weighing machines,
    shoe shining appliances.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by users
    and maintenance persons.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n–
    for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national authorities responsible for health,
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for household use;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n–
    appliances for washing cars;<br />\r\n– dispensing appliances and vending machines
    (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n– appliances within the scope of IEC 62368-1, such
    as jukeboxes, household video games copying machines, ticket machines and automatic
    teller machines;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used when a trained attendant
    is present, such as virtual reality systems;<br />\r\n– equipment intended exclusively
    for fairgrounds, such as carousels;<br />\r\n– self-balancing personal transport
    devices (IEC 60335-2-114).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the
    third edition published in 2017 and Amendment 1:2020. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment
    with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text
    (Clause 1, 19.2, 19.101, 22.104);<br />\r\nc) introduction of test probe 18 (22.101);<br
    />\r\nd) introduction of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\ne) addition of
    surface temperature rise limits (11.3, 11.8, Table 101).<br />\r\nThis part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
