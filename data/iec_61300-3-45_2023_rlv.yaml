abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-3-45:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61000-3-45:2023
    describes the procedure required to measure the statistical distribution and mean
    attenuation for random mated optical connectors with physical contact (PC) and
    angled physical contact (APC) polished multi-fibre rectangular ferrules as defined
    in the IEC 61754 series. This measurement method is applicable to cable assemblies.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2011.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    addition of sample size for > 12-fibre connector measurement;<br />\r\nb) inclusion
    of guidance for multimode measurement."
