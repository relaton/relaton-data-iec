abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022 This document specifies requirements for the structure
    and expression of an architecture description (AD) for various entities, including
    software, systems, enterprises, systems of systems, families of systems, products
    (goods or services), product lines, service lines, technologies and business domains.<br
    />\r\nThis document distinguishes the architecture of an entity of interest from
    an AD expressing that architecture. Architectures are not the subject of this
    document.<br />\r\nThis document specifies requirements for use of the architectural
    concepts and their relationships as captured in an AD. It does not specify requirements
    for any entity of interest or its environment.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    requirements for an architecture description framework (ADF), an architecture
    description language (ADL), architecture viewpoints and model kinds in order to
    usefully support the development and use of an AD.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    conformance to the requirements for an AD, ADF, ADL, architecture viewpoint and
    model kind.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify the processes, architecting
    methods, models, notations, techniques or tools by which an AD is created, utilized
    or managed.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify any format or media for recording
    an AD."
