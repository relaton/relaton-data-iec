abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13868:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of name identification supplementary services at the Q reference point between
    Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within
    a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The name identification supplementary
    services are Calling Name Identification Presentation (SS-CNIP) and Connected
    Name Identification Presentation (SS-CONP).</p><p>Calling Name Identification
    Presentation (CNIP) is a supplementary service which is offered to the called
    user and which provides the name of the calling user (calling party name) to the
    called user.</p><p>Connected Name Identification Presentation (CONP) is a supplementary
    service which is offered to the calling user and which provides to the calling
    user the following:</p><ul><li>the name of the user who answers the call (connected
    party name);</li><li>optionally the name of the alerting user (called party name);</li><li>optionally
    the name of the called user who cannot be reached (busy party name).</li></ul><p>The
    supplementary service Calling/Connected Name Identification Restriction (CNIR)
    has no impact on the signalling at Q reference point.</p><p>Provision of a user's
    name to the PISN is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 13868:2003.</p><p>The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced
    in three stages according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13868:2003
    contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the
    requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13864.</p>"
