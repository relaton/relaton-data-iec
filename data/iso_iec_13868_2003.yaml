abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    13868:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of name identification
    supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services
    Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services
    Network (PISN). The name identification supplementary services are Calling Name
    Identification Presentation (SS-CNIP) and Connected Name Identification Presentation
    (SS-CONP).<br />\r\nCalling Name Identification Presentation (CNIP) is a supplementary
    service which is offered to the called user and which provides the name of the
    calling user (calling party name) to the called user.<br />\r\nConnected Name
    Identification Presentation (CONP) is a supplementary service which is offered
    to the calling user and which provides to the calling user the following:\r\n\r\n\tthe
    name of the user who answers the call (connected party name);\r\n\toptionally
    the name of the alerting user (called party name);\r\n\toptionally the name of
    the called user who cannot be reached (busy party name).\r\n\r\nThe supplementary
    service Calling/Connected Name Identification Restriction (CNIR) has no impact
    on the signalling at Q reference point.<br />\r\nProvision of a user's name to
    the PISN is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 13868:2003.<br />\r\nThe Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced
    in three stages according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13868:2003
    contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the
    requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13864."
