  content: "IEC 61196-5:2018(E), which is a sectional specification, applies to coaxial
    cables for analogue and digital one- and two-way signal transmission, e.g. for
    cable networks for television signals, sound signals and interactive services
    in accordance with IEC 60728-1, IEC 60728-1-1, IEC 60728-101, IEC 60728-10, ISO/IEC
    11801-1 and ISO/IEC 11801-4. This includes also the transmission of BCT signals
    provided by a CATV, MATV or SMATV cable networks.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    the test procedures and requirements for trunk and distribution cables for temperatures
    between −40 °C and +65 °C and in the frequency range of 5 MHz to 2 000 MHz.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical change with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) 1 Scope: revised, frequency range extended to 2 000 MHz;<br />\r\nb)
    4.3 Dielectric: life expectancy of the dielectric is proved by oxidative induction
    time (OIT) test before and after ageing according to IEC 60811-410;<br />\r\nc)
    Annex A: Table A.1, Cable types added."
