  content: "IEC 62552-1:2015+A1:2020+A2:2025 specifies the essential characteristics
    of household refrigerating appliances, cooled by internal natural convection or
    forced air circulation, and establishes test methods for checking the characteristics.
    For the purposes of declaration, the tests defined in this part of IEC 62552 are
    considered to be type tests to assess the fundamental design and operation of
    a refrigerating appliance. This part of IEC 62552 does not define requirements
    for production sampling or conformity assessment or certification. This part of
    IEC 62552 does not define a regime for verification testing as this varies by
    region and country. When verification of the performance of a refrigerating appliance
    of a given type in relation to this standard is necessary, it is preferable, wherever
    practicable, that all the tests specified be applied to a single unit. The tests
    can also be made individually for the study of a particular characteristic. IEC
    62552-1, -2 and -3 cancel and replace the first edition of IEC 62552 published
    in 2007. IEC 62552-1, -2 and -3 constitute a technical revision and includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to IEC 62552:2007:<br />\r\na)
    All parts of the standard have been largely rewritten and updated to cope with
    new testing requirements, new product configurations, the advent of electronic
    product controls and computer based test-room data collection and processing equipment.<br
    />\r\nb) In Part 1 (this part) there are some changes to test room equipment specifications
    and the setup for testing to provide additional flexibility especially when testing
    multiple appliances in a single test room.<br />\r\nThis consolidated version
    consists of the first edition (2015) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication."
