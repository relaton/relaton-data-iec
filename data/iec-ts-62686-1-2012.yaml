  content: IEC 62686-1:2012(E) defines the minimum requirements for general purpose
    "off the shelf" COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) integrated circuits and discrete
    semiconductors for ADHP (Aerospace, Defence and High Performance) applications.
    Applies to all components that can be operated in ADHP applications within the
    manufacturers' publicly available datasheet limits in conjunction with IEC/TS
    62239-1. It may be used by other high performance and high reliability industries,
    at their discretion.
