  content: CISPR 16-2-5:2008(E) deals with in situ electromagnetic disturbance measurements
    in any environment from physically large equipment and systems excluding networks.
    It covers both radiated and conducted emission phenomena, and does not deal with
    immunity tests. This technical report is intended to be applied primarily to such
    physically large equipment which are not under the scope of any existing emission
    standards (as for example CISPR 11 and CISPR 22). It serves only as a guideline
    on how to deal with emissions of that equipment at the particular location of
    installation. It does not establish any emission requirements. Due to the severe
    impact of the conditions existing at a particular location of operation and the
    use of the respective large equipment, however, it is not intended to use the
    measurements in the frame of type testing. Reference in-situ measurement distances
    will be given. This allows comparison of the measurement results with limits from
    existing relevant standards. The frequency range under consideration is from 9
    kHz to 18 GHz.
