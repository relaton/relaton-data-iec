  content: "IEC 60127-8:2018+AMD1:2024 CSV relates to fuse resistors with particular
    overcurrent protection rated up to AC 500 V and/or DC 500 V for printed circuits
    and other substrate systems, used for the protection of electric appliances, electronic
    equipment and component parts thereof, normally intended to be used indoors. It
    does not apply to fuse resistors with particular overcurrent protection for appliances
    intended to be used under special conditions, such as in a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere.<br />\r\nThe object of this part of IEC 60127 is<br />\r\na) to establish
    uniform requirements for fuse resistors with particular overcurrent protection
    so as to protect appliances or parts of appliances in the most suitable way;<br
    />\r\nb) to define the performance of the fuse resistors with particular overcurrent
    protection, so as to give guidance to manufacturers of electrical appliances and
    electronic equipment and to ensure replacement of fuse resistors with particular
    overcurrent protection by those of similar dimensions and characteristics;<br
    />\r\nc) to establish uniform test methods for fuse resistors with particular
    overcurrent protection, so as to allow verification of the values (for example
    rated dissipation, functioning characteristic and rated breaking capacity values)
    specified by the manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 60127 applies in addition
    to the requirements of IEC 60127-1. This first edition of IEC 60127-8 cancels
    and replaces IEC PAS 60127-8:2014. This international standard is to be used in
    conjunction with IEC 60127-1.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: Miniature Fuses, Fuse-Resistors,
    Overcurrent Protection"
