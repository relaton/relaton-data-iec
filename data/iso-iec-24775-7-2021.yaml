    <p style="text-align: left;">The host-base storage portion of the Storage Management Technical Specification defines management profiles for autonomous, component and abstract profiles for management of host-based storage devices. The autonomous profiles describe the management of a stand-alone host-based storage entity. The component profiles describe management of aspects of host-based storage entities that may be used by other autonomous profiles. Finally, this section describes abstract profiles that may be used as a basis for creating additional Host-based autonomous profiles.<br />This version of the Host-based Storage portion of the Storage Management Technical Specification includes autonomous profiles:</p>
    <ul>
    <li style="text-align: left;">"The Host Discovered Resources Profile<br />This profile defines the model for the storage devices presented to an operating system running on a host<br />computer system. In addition, this profile describes the map of storage associated to a host-computer system<br />that a client application can discover.</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">"The Fibre Channel HBA Profile<br />This profile defines the model and functions of a Fibre Channel HBA that exports block storage to a host<br />computer system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel switch, array, tape library, etc.).</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">iSCSI Initiator Profile<br />This profile defines the model and functions necessary to manage an iSCSI initiator.<br />Component profiles used by autonomous profiles to describe aspects of host-based storage elements<br />and services. The component profiles defined in this version of the specification include:</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">Host Hardware RAID Controller Profile<br />This profile defines the model and functions of a host-based RAID controller that exports block storage to a<br />host computer system from locally attached storage devices (internal hard drives, JBODs, etc.)</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">Storage HBA Profile<br />This profile defines the model and functions of a SAS, SATA, SPI, or Fibre Channel HBA that exports storage<br />to a host computer system from a SAN device (Fibre Channel switch, array, tape library, etc.).</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">Disk Partition Profile<br />The Disk Partition profile models partition (or slice) configuration services provided by operating systems on<br />some platforms.</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">SB Multipath Management Profile<br />The SB Multipath Management Profile models paths (connections between host controllers and device ports)<br />for environments supporting the SB (Single Byte) command protocol.</li>
    <li style="text-align: left;">SCSI Multipath Management Profile<br />The SCSI Multipath Management profile models paths (connections between host controllers, device ports,<br />and logical units) for environments supporting the SCSI command protocol.</li>
    </ul>
