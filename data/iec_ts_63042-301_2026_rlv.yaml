abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63042-301:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 63042-301:2026,
    which is a technical specification, applies to on-site acceptance tests of electrical
    equipment with the highest voltages of AC transmission system exceeding 800 kV
    and its protection and control system.<br />\r\nThe electrical equipment exceeding
    800 kV includes the following items:<br />\r\n- power transformers;<br />\r\n-
    circuit-breakers;<br />\r\n- gas insulated switchgear (GIS);<br />\r\n- gas insulated
    transmission line (GIL);<br />\r\n- surge arresters;<br />\r\n- voltage and current
    transformers;<br />\r\n- shunt reactors;<br />\r\n- series compensators;<br />\r\n-
    insulators;<br />\r\n- disconnectors and earthing switches;<br />\r\n- high-speed
    earthing switches (HSES).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) new subclause with measurement of short-circuit
    impedance and load loss for on-site assembly transformer has been added;<br />\r\nb)
    new subclause with measurement of no-load loss and current for on-site assembly
    transformer has been added;<br />\r\nc) on-site acceptance test requirement for
    GIL has been added;<br />\r\nd) new clause with protection and control system
    on-site acceptance tests has been added."
