  content: Aims at identifying the classification level of nonhermetic solid state
    Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) that are sensitive to moisture-induced stress so
    that they can be properly packaged, stored and handled to avoid subsequent thermal/mechanical
    damage during the assembly solder reflow attachment and/or repair operation.
