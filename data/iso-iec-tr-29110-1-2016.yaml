    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-1:2016 introduces the major concepts required to understand and use the ISO/IEC 29110 series. It introduces the characteristics and requirements of a VSE and clarifies the rationale for VSE-specific profiles, documents, standards and guides.</p>
    <p>It also introduces process, lifecycle, standardization concepts and defines the organizational terms common to the VSE Profile Set of Documents.</p>
    <p>It is applicable to a VSE. A VSE is an entity (enterprise, organization, department or project) having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series, Standardized Profiles and Technical Reports are not intended to preclude nor discourage their use by an entity that is larger than a VSE.</p>
    <p>It is targeted both at the general audience wishing to understand the series of documents and, more specifically, at users of the ISO/IEC 29110 series. It should be read first when initially exploring VSE Profile documents. While there is no specific prerequisite to read this part of ISO/IEC 29110, it will be helpful to the user in understanding the other parts.</p>
    <p>The lifecycle processes defined in the set of Standardized Profiles and Technical Reports can be used by a VSE when developing, acquiring and using, as well as when creating and supplying systems having hardware and software elements and software. They can be applied at any level in a systems development, software system's structure and at any stage in the lifecycle. They are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that a VSE finds useful.</p>
