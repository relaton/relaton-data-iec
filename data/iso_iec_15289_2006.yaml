abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15289:2006 was developed to assist users of systems and software
    life cycle processes to manage information items (documents). It is based on the
    life cycle processes specified in ISO/IEC 15288 or ISO/IEC 12207:1995/AMD 1:2002/AMD
    2. Information items are essential to preserving what transpired when using system
    life cycle processes, and may be identified as deliverable documents.ISO/IEC 15289:2006
    identifies the purpose and content of all identified systems and software life
    cycle information items as required for the various life cycle processes. The
    information item contents are defined according to generic document types (which
    may be referred to as information item types) and the specific purpose of the
    document. ISO/IEC 15289:2006 may be applied to any of the activities and tasks
    of a project, system or software product, or service life cycle. It is not limited
    by the size, complexity or criticality of the project. It may be applied to all
    forms of information items, information item content, and document delivery media.
    Information items may be combined or subdivided as needed for project or organizational
    purposes. The nomenclature for information items, document titles and contents
    is informative.
