  content: "IEC 61300-1:2022+AMD1:2024+AMD1:2025 CSV provides general information
    and guidance for the basic test and measurement procedures defined in IEC 61300-2
    (all parts) and IEC 61300-3 (all parts) for interconnecting devices, passive components,
    mechanical splices, fusion splice protectors, fibre management systems and protective
    housings. This document is used in combination with the relevant specification
    which defines the tests to be used, the required degree of severity for each of
    them, their sequence, if relevant, and the permissible performance limits. In
    the event of conflict between this document and the relevant specification, the
    latter takes precedence. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition
    published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- addition of the information of measurement uncertainties in
    4.2.1;<br />\r\n- change of the requirements for attenuation variation in 4.2.2;<br
    />\r\n- addition of the multimode launch conditions of other fibres than A1-OM2,
    A1-OM3, A1-OM4, A1-OM5 and A3e in 10.4;<br />\r\n- addition of the multimode launch
    conditions of the planer waveguide in 10.6;<br />\r\n- splitting Annex A for EF
    and Annex B for EAF;<br />\r\n- correction of errors in the definitions of encircled
    flux and encircled angular flux."
