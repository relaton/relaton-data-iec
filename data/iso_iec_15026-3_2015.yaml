abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15026-3:2015 specifies the concept of integrity levels with corresponding
    integrity level requirements that are required to be met in order to show the
    achievement of the integrity level. It places requirements on and recommends methods
    for defining and using integrity levels and their corresponding integrity level
    requirements. It covers systems, software products, and their elements, as well
    as relevant external dependences.<p>This part of ISO/IEC 15026 is applicable to
    systems and software and is intended for use by the following:</p><p>a) definers
    of integrity levels such as industry and professional organizations, standards
    organizations, and government agencies;</p><p>b) users of integrity levels such
    as developers and maintainers, suppliers and acquirers, system or software users,
    assessors of systems or software and administrative and technical support staff
    of systems and/or software products.</p><p>One important use of integrity levels
    is by suppliers and acquirers in agreements; for example, to aid in assuring safety,
    financial, or security characteristics of a delivered system or product.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15026-3:2015 does not prescribe a specific set of integrity levels or their integrity
    level requirements. In addition, it does not prescribe the way in which integrity
    level use is integrated with the overall system or software engineering life cycle
    processes. It does, however, provide an example of use of this part of ISO/IEC
    15026 in Annex A.</p>
