- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC 62256:2017 is also available as IEC 62256:2017 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    62256:2017 covers turbines, storage pumps and pump-turbines of all sizes and of
    the following types: Francis; Kaplan; propeller; Pelton (turbines only) and bulb
    turbines.<br />\r\nThis document also identifies without detailed discussion,
    other powerhouse equipment that could affect or be affected by a turbine, storage
    pump, or pump-turbine rehabilitation. The object of this document is to assist
    in identifying, evaluating and executing rehabilitation and performance improvement
    projects for hydraulic turbines, storage pumps and pump-turbines. This document
    can be used by owners, consultants, and suppliers to define: needs and economics
    for rehabilitation and performance improvement; scope of work; specifications
    and evaluation of results. This document is intended to be: an aid in the decision
    process; an extensive source of information on rehabilitation; an identification
    of the key milestones in the rehabilitation process; and identification of the
    points to be addressed in the decision processes. This document is not intended
    to be a detailed engineering manual nor a maintenance document. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition: Tables 2 to 23 modified, completed
    and moved to Annex A; 7.3.2: subclauses moved with text changes; new subclauses
    on temperature, noise, galvanic corrosion, galling and replacement of components
    without assessment; 7.3.3: complete new subclause on residual life; Tables 29
    to 32 moved to Annex C; New Annex B with assessment examples.<br />\r\nKey words:
    Turbines, Storage pump, Pump turbines, Rehabilitation, Performance."
