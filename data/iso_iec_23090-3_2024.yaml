abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoNormal">This document specifies a video coding technology
    known as versatile video coding (VVC), comprising a video coding technology with
    a compression capability that is substantially beyond that of the prior generations
    of such standards and with sufficient versatility for effective use in a broad
    range of applications.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Only the syntax format, semantics,
    and associated decoding process requirements are specified, while other matters
    such as pre-processing, the encoding process, system signalling and multiplexing,
    data loss recovery, post-processing, and video display are considered to be outside
    the scope of this document. Additionally, the internal processing steps performed
    within a decoder are also considered to be outside the scope of this document;
    only the externally observable output behaviour is required to conform to the
    specifications of this document.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This document is designed
    to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide range of applications, bit rates,
    resolutions, qualities and services. Applications include, but are not limited
    to, video coding for digital storage media, television broadcasting and real-time
    communication. In the course of creating This document, various requirements from
    typical applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements have
    been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence, this
    document is designed to facilitate video data interchange among different applications.</p>
