abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24730 defines two air interface protocols and a single application
    program interface (API) for real-time locating systems (RTLS) for use in asset
    management and is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage interoperability
    of products for the growing RTLS market. ISO/IEC 24730-1:2006, the RTLS API, establishes
    a technical standard for RTLS. To be fully compliant with this standard, RTLS
    must comply with ISO/IEC 24730-1:2006 and at least one air interface protocol
    defined in ISO/IEC 24730. RTLS are wireless systems with the ability to locate
    the position of an item anywhere in a defined space (local/campus, wide area/regional,
    global) at a point in time that is, or is close to, real time. Position is derived
    by measurements of the physical properties of the radio link. Conceptually there
    are four classifications of RTLS:Locating an asset via satellite (requires line-of-sight)
    - accuracy to 10 m.Locating an asset in a controlled area, e.g. warehouse, campus,
    airport (area of interest is instrumented) - accuracy to 3 m. Locating an asset
    in a more confined area (area of interest is instrumented) - accuracy to tens
    of centimetres. Locating an asset over a terrestrial area using a terrestrial
    mounted receiver over a wide area, e.g. cell phone towers - accuracy to 200 m.There
    are a further two methods of locating an object which are really RFID rather than
    RTLS:Locating an asset by virtue of the fact that the asset has passed point A
    at a certain time and has not passed point B.Locating an asset by virtue of providing
    a homing beacon whereby a person with a handheld can find an asset.The method
    of location is through identification and location, generally through multi-lateration.
    The different types areTime of Flight Ranging Systems,Amplitude Triangulation,Time
    Difference of Arrival (TDOA),Cellular Triangulation,Satellite Multi-lateration,Angle
    of Arrival.ISO/IEC 24730-1:2006 defines an API needed for utilizing an RTLS.An
    API is a boundary across which application software uses facilities of programming
    languages to invoke services. These facilities may include procedures or operations,
    shared data objects and resolution of identifiers. A wide range of services may
    be required at an API to support applications. Different methods may be appropriate
    for documenting API specifications for different types of services.The information
    flow across the API boundary is defined by the syntax and semantics of a particular
    programming language, such that the user of that language may access the services
    provided by the application platform on the other side of the boundary. This implies
    the specification of a mapping of the functions being made available by the application
    platform into the syntax and semantics of the programming language. An API specification
    documents a service and/or service access method that is available at an interface
    between the application and an application platform. This API describes the RTLS
    service and its access methods, to enable client applications to interface with
    the RTLS. This RTLS service is the minimum service that must be provided by an
    RTLS to be API compatible with this standard.ISO/IEC 24730-1:2006 enables software
    applications to utilize an RTLS infrastructure to locate assets with RTLS transmitters
    attached to them. It defines a boundary across which application software uses
    facilities of programming languages to collect information contained in RTLS tag
    blinks received by the RTLS infrastructure.
