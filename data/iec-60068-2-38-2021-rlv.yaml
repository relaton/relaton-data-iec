  content: "IEC 60068-2-38:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60068-2-38:2021 specifies
    a composite test procedure, primarily intended for component type specimens, to
    determine, in an accelerated manner, the resistance of specimens to the deteriorative
    effects of high temperature/humidity and cold conditions. This test standard does
    not apply to specimens that are energized during the complete test. Specimens
    can be energized during the constant phases of the tests. Measurements on energized
    specimens are typically carried out during constant phases of the test unless
    specified otherwise. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition,
    published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- the figures have been updated;<br />\r\n- changes to the wording
    has been made for clarification purposes.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
