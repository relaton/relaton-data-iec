    IEC/TS 62282-7-1:2010(E) covers cell assemblies, test apparatus, measuring instruments and measuring methods, performance test methods, and test reports for PEFC single cells. This Technical Specification is used for evaluating:<br />
    - the performance of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for PEFCs;<br />
    - materials or structures of other components of PEFCs;<br />
    - or the influence of impurities in fuel and/or in air on the fuel cell performance.
