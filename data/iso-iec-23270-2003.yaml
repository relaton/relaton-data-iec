    <p>ISO/IEC 23270:2003 specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of programs written in the C# programming language. It specifies:</p>
    <ul><li>the representation of C# programs;</li><li>the syntax and constraints of the C# language;</li><li>the semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;</li><li>the restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.</li></ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23270:2003 does not specify:</p>
    <ul><li>the mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for use by a data-processing system;</li><li>the mechanism by which C# applications are invoked for use by a data-processing system;</li><li>the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C# application;</li><li>the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;</li><li>the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;</li><li>all minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming implementation.</li></ul>
