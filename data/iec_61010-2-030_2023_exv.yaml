abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-030:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 61010-2-030:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD1:2016.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-030:2023
    specifies safety requirements for equipment having testing or measuring circuits
    which are connected for test or measurement purposes to devices or circuits outside
    the measurement equipment itself. These include measuring circuits which are part
    of electrical test and measurement equipment, laboratory equipment, or process
    control equipment. These circuits in equipment have additional protective means
    between the circuit and an operator. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) in 1.2.1, requirements for protection against
    hazards which could occur from reading a voltage have been added to the scope;<br
    />\r\nb) Clause 2, all normative references have been dated and new normative
    references have been added;<br />\r\nc) in 4.3.2.5, requirements for power supply
    have been modified;<br />\r\nd) in 4.3.2.6, requirements for inputs/outputs have
    been modified;<br />\r\ne) in 4.4.2.101, a new subclause about surge protective
    devices has been added;<br />\r\nf) in 5.1.5.101.2, minimum ratings for voltage
    of measuring terminals are required;<br />\r\ng) Subclause 6.6.101 modifies 6.6.101
    and 6.6.102 of previous edition:<br />\r\n1) in 6.6.101.1, insulating material
    of group I may be allowed for determination of creepage distances of measuring
    circuit terminals;<br />\r\n2) In 6.6.101.2, clearances and creepage distances
    up to 3 000 V for measuring circuit terminals in unmated position have been defined;<br
    />\r\n3) in 6.6.101.3, requirements for measuring circuit terminals in partially
    mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n4) in 6.6.101.4, requirements for
    measuring circuit terminals in mated position have been specified;<br />\r\n5)
    Subclause 6.6.101.5 replaces 6.6.102;<br />\r\nh) Subclause 9.101 to consider
    the protection of measuring circuits against the spread of fire and arc flash
    has been added and Table 102 has been replaced by Table K.101;<br />\r\ni) in
    9.101.2, relocation of 101.3 of previous edition;<br />\r\nj) in 9.101.3, relocation
    of 101.4 of previous edition, extension to measurement category II and reference
    to IEC 61000-4-5 for tests;<br />\r\nk) in 14.101, relocation of 14.102 and 14.101
    of previous edition has been removed;<br />\r\nl) in 101.3, relocation of 101.5
    of previous edition, and more requirements added against hazard occurring from
    reading a voltage value;<br />\r\nm) in K.2.1, another method for determination
    of clearances of secondary circuits is proposed;<br />\r\nn) in K.3.2, new Table
    K.15 and Table K.16 for clearance calculation;<br />\r\no) in K.101.4.1, new Table
    K.103 and Table K.104 replace Table K.102, Table K.103 and Table K.104;<br />\r\np)
    in K.101.4, the subclause has been reviewed; Tables and tests for solid insulation
    have been modified; Table K.105 replaces Table K.9;<br />\r\nq) Table K.101, replacement
    of Table K.106;<br />\r\nr) Clause K.4, redraft of the clause to propose a method
    for determination of Ut for circuits which reduce transient overvoltages;<br />\r\ns)
    Annex AA: Figure AA.1 has been redesigned;<br />\r\nt) Annex EE: addition of a
    new informative annex for determination of clearances for Table 101.<br />\r\nIt
    has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
