abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62799:2013(E), which is a technical report, provides background
    information for users of IEC 62359 to understand the relative merits of several
    of the potential replacements for the thermal index as described in IEC 60601-2-37
    and IEC 62359. The report discusses parameters related to thermal aspects of diagnostic
    ultrasonic fields; and methods for the determination of an exposure parameter
    relating to temperature rise in theoretical tissue-equivalent models, resulting
    from absorption of ultrasound. The report is intended to be used:<br />\r\n- by
    those involved in the development and maintenance of IEC 62359;<br />\r\n- manufacturers
    of medical electrical equipment for risk assessment;<br />\r\n- and health care
    regulatory authorities, test houses and other organizations responsible for implementing
    standards for medical electrical equipment."
