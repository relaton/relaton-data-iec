abstract:
- content: Provides a short survey of the radiation exposure in certain environments
    and applications and the different effects of radiation on fibres. The most important
    radiation effect, i.e., the increase of transmission loss, and its strong dependence
    on a variety of fibre properties and test conditions is also described.
