abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-20:2019 establishes general principles for design assessment
    of OTEC plants. The goal is to describe the design and assessment requirements
    of OTEC plants used for stable power generation under various conditions. This
    electricity may be used for utility supply or production of other energy carriers.
    The intended audience is developers, engineers, bankers, venture capitalists,
    entrepreneurs, finance authorities and regulators.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to land-based (i.e. onshore), shelf-mounted (i.e. nearshore seabed mounted) and
    floating OTEC systems. For land-based systems the scope of this document ends
    at the main power export cable suitable for connection to the grid. For shelf-mounted
    and floating systems, the scope of this document normally ends at the main power
    export cable where it connects to the electrical grid.<br />\r\nThis document
    is general and focuses on the OTEC specific or unique components of the power
    plant, particularly the marine aspects of the warm and cold water intake systems.
    Other established standards are referenced to address common components between
    the OTEC system and other types of power plants and floating, deep water oil and
    gas production vessels, such as FPSOs and FLNG systems. Relevant standards are
    listed within this document as appropriate."
