    <p>This Technical Report gives mechanisms for formally specifying the syntax of XML-based languages. For</p>
    <p>example, the syntax of XHTML 1.0 can be specified in RELAX.</p>
    <p>Compared with DTDs, RELAX provides the following advantages:</p>
    <p>- Specification in RELAX uses XML instance (i.e., document) syntax,</p>
    <p>- RELAX provides rich datatypes, and</p>
    <p>- RELAX is namespace-aware.</p>
    <p>The RELAX specification consists of two parts, <i>RELAX Core </i>and <i>RELAX Namespace</i>. This part of the Technical</p>
    <p>Report gives <i>RELAX Core, </i>which may be used to describe markup languages containing a single XML namespace.</p>
    <p>Part 2 of this Technical Report gives <i>RELAX Namespace</i>, which may be used to describe markup languages</p>
    <p>containing more than a single XML namespace, consisting of more than one <i>RELAX Core </i>document.</p>
    <p>Given a sequence of elements, a software module called the <i>RELAX Core </i>processor compares it against a</p>
    <p>specification in <i>RELAX Core </i>and reports the result. The <i>RELAX Core </i>processor can be directly invoked by the</p>
    <p>user, and can also be invoked by another software module called the <i>RELAX Namespace </i>processor.</p>
    <p>RELAX may be used in conjunction with DTDs. In particular, notations and entities declared by DTDs can be</p>
    <p>constrained by RELAX.</p>
    <p>This part of the Technical Report also gives a subset of <i>RELAX Core</i>, which is restricted to DTD features plus</p>
    <p>datatypes. This subset is very easy to implement, and with the exception of datatype information, conversion</p>
    <p>between this subset and XML DTDs results in no information loss.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1 Since XML is a subset of WebSGML (TC2 of ISO 8879), RELAX is applicable to SGML.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2 A successor of RELAX Core is being developed at the RELAX NG TC of OASIS.</p>
