  content: IEC 62977-2-11:2023 specifies the local luminance and uniformity measurement
    methods of emissive displays. The light measuring device’s (LMD) measurement field
    will cover more than 500 pixels of TVs, monitors or signage displays. The local
    luminance and uniformity measurement methods identify optical variations within
    the local block where over 500 emission pixels are regularly placed.
