  content: Within customer premises, the importance of the cabling infrastructure
    is similar to that of other fundamental building utilities such as heating, lighting
    and mains power. As with other utilities, interruptions to service can have a
    serious impact. Poor quality of service due to lack of design foresight, use of
    inappropriate components, incorrect installation, poor administration or inadequate
    support can threaten an organisation's effectiveness. Historically, the cabling
    within premises comprised both application specific and multipurpose networks.
    The original edition of this standard enabled a controlled migration to generic
    cabling and the reduction in the use of application-specific cabling. This second
    edition of ISO/IEC 11801 has been developed to reflect the increased demands and
    opportunities which have arisen since - and are partly the result of - publication
    of the first edition in 1995. The contents of the corrigendas of September 2002
    and December 2002 have been included in this copy.
