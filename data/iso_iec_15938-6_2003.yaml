abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15938-6:2003 is the reference software for ISO/IEC 15938 standard.
    It implements the normative components of the ISO/IEC 15938 standard, which are
    the descriptors and description schemes and their coding schemes.</p><p>Besides
    this, also informative components are implemented. These are, e.g, the procedures
    to extract descriptions and to match descriptions. This way, the reference software
    implements basic functionalities for individual descriptors and description schemes
    in the so-called key applications.</p><p>Besides the reference software source
    code, ISO/IEC 15938-6:2003 gives also a description of the reference software.
    The components of the key applications and their interfaces are specified.</p>"
