abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18051:2012 specifies the Services and Event Reports for Computer-Supported Telecommunications
    Applications, Phase III (CSTA).<br />\r\nIt is focused on providing application
    service interfaces to a Switching Function, Computing Function and a Special Resource
    Function. A CSTA application interface is disassociated from the various user-network
    interfaces and network-network interfaces CSTA applications serve, observe or
    manipulate. Because CSTA operates with existing telecommunications interfaces
    indirectly, it operates generically so that differences among various existing
    interfaces are hidden from CSTA applications. Support of user-to-network interfaces
    is outside the scope of CSTA. Although most terminal equipment (TE) is suitable
    for use with CSTA, there will be instances of TE that will not be suitable in
    certain circumstances.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 18051:2012 defines services that allow
    functional integration between a computing network and a telecommunications network.
    Computing platforms (i.e., Application Programming Interfaces - APIs) that support
    such functionally-integrated applications are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18051:2012.<br
    />\r\nCommunication between the computing and switching (i.e., telecommunications)
    networks can take place via intervening networks ranging from simple point-to-point
    connections to local- or wide-area telecommunications networks.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18051:2012 is part of a suite of CSTA Standards and Technical Reports that provides
    a comprehensive description of the architectural and practical issues involved
    in applying, implementing, and utilizing CSTA-based CTI applications."
