abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60601-4-5:2021 provides detailed technical specifications for SECURITY
    features of MEDICAL DEVICES used in MEDICAL IT-NETWORKS. MEDICAL DEVICES dealt
    with in this document include MEDICAL ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT, MEDICAL ELECTRICAL
    SYSTEMS and MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE. MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE, although not in
    the scope of IEC 60601 (all parts), can also make use of this document. Based
    on the seven foundational requirements described in the state-of-the-art document
    IEC TS 62443 1 1:2009, this document provides specifications for different MEDICAL
    DEVICE capability SECURITY LEVELS (SL C). The specified SECURITY capabilities
    of a MEDICAL DEVICE can be used by various members of the medical community to
    integrate the device correctly into defined SECURITY ZONES and CONDUITS of a MEDICAL
    IT-NETWORK with an appropriate MEDICAL IT NETWORK's target SECURITY LEVEL (SL
    T).<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to MEDICAL DEVICES with external data
    interface(s), for example when connected to a MEDICAL IT-NETWORK or when a human
    interface is used for processing – e.g. entering, capturing or viewing – CONFIDENTIAL
    DATA.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to other software used on a MEDICAL
    IT-NETWORK which does not meet the definition of MEDICAL DEVICE SOFTWARE.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to in-vitro diagnostic devices (IVD)."
