  content: "IEC 60335-2-39:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of electrically
    operated commercial multi-purpose cooking pans, their rated voltage being not
    more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase and neutral
    and 480 V for other appliances. This standard also deals with pressurized appliances
    and appliances with pressurized parts. These appliances are not intended for household
    and similar purposes. They are used for commercial processing of food in areas
    not open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens, hospitals
    and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries.<br />\r\nThe electrical
    part of appliances making use of other forms of energy is also within the scope
    of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by these types of appliances.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- appliances for continuous mass production of food;<br />\r\n- deep fat
    fryers (IEC 60335-2-37);<br />\r\n- battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis
    seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2012 and Amendment
    1:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes
    have been converted to normative text or modified (Clause 1, 15.1, 15.102, 16.2,
    19.101, 27.2);<br />\r\nc) exclusion of battery-operated appliances and appliances
    used in areas open to the public (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) relocation of cleaning
    instructions from 7.12.1 to 7.12;<br />\r\ne) relocation of 24.101 to 22.115;<br
    />\r\nf) conciliation of the text of IEC 60335-2-39 with other standards under
    IEC/TC61/MT32;<br />\r\ng) clarifications and modifications to some test specifications
    have been made (9.101, 11.4, 15.1.1, 15.102, 20.1, 25.3).<br />\r\nThis Part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
