  content: "IEC 60317-18:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60317-18:2020
    specifies the requirements of enamelled rectangular copper winding wires of class
    120 with a sole coating based on polyvinyl acetal or polyvinyl formal resin, which
    can be modified provided it retains the chemical identity of the original resin
    and meets all specified wire requirements<br />\r\nNOTE 1 A modified resin is
    a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives
    to enhance certain performance or application characteristics.<br />\r\nNOTE 2
    Polyvinyl acetate is a general name for a family of thermoplastic vinyl resins
    produced by the condensation of polyvinyl alcohol with an aldehyde. Examples are
    polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl formal and polyvinyl butyral.<br />\r\nThe range of
    nominal conductor dimensions covered by this document is:<br />\r\n- width: min.
    2,0 mm max. 31,5 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm max. 10,0 mm.<br />\r\nWires
    of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this specification and apply to the complete
    range of conductors. The specified combinations of width and thickness as well
    as the specified ratio width/thickness are given in IEC 60317-0-2. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2004 and Amendment
    1:2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- modification of the Scope (Clause 1);<br />\r\n- revision to thermal class
    designation from 105 to 120 in 3.2.2;<br />\r\n- renaming of stretching test to
    adherence test, and modification to the requirements in 8.2;<br />\r\n- revision
    to the cut-through requirement in Clause 10."
