  content: "IEC 60749-30:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60749-30:2020 establishes
    a standard procedure for determining the preconditioning of non-hermetic surface
    mount devices (SMDs) prior to reliability testing.<br />\r\nThe test method defines
    the preconditioning flow for non-hermetic solid-state SMDs representative of a
    typical industry multiple solder reflow operation.<br />\r\nThese SMDs are subjected
    to the appropriate preconditioning sequence described in this document prior to
    being submitted to specific in-house reliability testing (qualification and/or
    reliability monitoring) in order to evaluate long term reliability (impacted by
    soldering stress). This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- inclusion of new Clause 3;<br
    />\r\n- expansion of 6.7 on solder reflow;<br />\r\n- inclusion of explanatory
    notes and clarifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
