abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62669:2019(E) is a Technical Report. This document presents a series
    of case studies in which electromagnetic (EM) fields are evaluated in accordance
    with IEC 62232:2017. The case studies presented in this document involve intentionally
    radiating base stations (BS). The BS transmit on one or more antennas using one
    or more frequencies in the range 110 MHz to 100 GHz and RF exposure assessments
    take into account the contribution of ambient sources at least in the 100 kHz
    to 300 GHz frequency range.<br />\r\nEach case study has been chosen to illustrate
    a typical BS evaluation scenario and employs the methods detailed in IEC 62232:2017.
    The case studies are provided for guidance only and are not a substitute for a
    thorough understanding of the requirements of IEC 62232:2017. Based on the lessons
    learned from each case study, recommendations about RF assessment topics to be
    considered in the next revision of IEC 62232 are proposed. The methodologies and
    approaches described in this document are useful for the assessment of early 5G
    products introduced for consumer trials or deployments.<br />\r\nThis document
    provides background and rationale for applying a compliance approach based on
    the actual maximum transmitted power or EIRP. Guidance for collecting and analysing
    information about the transmitted power of a base station and evaluating its actual
    maximum RF exposure based on modelling studies or measurement studies on operational
    sites (in networks, sub-networks or field trials) is also presented.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2011. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nKeywords: Human Exposure, Wireless
    Communication Devices, RF field strength, power density and SAR in the vicinity
    of radiocommunication base stations"
