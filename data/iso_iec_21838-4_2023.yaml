abstract:
- content: "This document describes TUpper as an ontology that is conformant to the
    requirements specified for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838-1.<br />\r\nThis
    document describes TUpper as a resource designed to support ontology design, ontology
    integration, automated reasoning, and semantic integration of heterogeneous information
    systems.<br />\r\nThe following are within the scope of this document:<br />\r\n-
    definitions of classes and relations in the signature of TUpper;<br />\r\n- axiomatizations
    of TUpper in OWL 2 and CL;<br />\r\n- documentation of the conformity of TUpper
    to the requirements specified for top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838-1;<br
    />\r\n- documentation of the methodology for specifying domain ontologies that
    conform to TUpper.<br />\r\nThe following are outside the scope of this document:<br
    />\r\n- specification of ontology languages, including the languages RDF, OWL
    and CL standardly used in ontology development;<br />\r\n- specification of methods
    for reasoning with ontologies;<br />\r\n- specification of translators between
    the notations of ontologies developed in different ontology languages."
