abstract:
- content: "IEC 62372:2021 is applicable to housed scintillators for registration
    and spectrometry of alpha-, beta-, gamma-, X-ray and neutron radiation. This document
    specifies the requirements for the testing equipment and test methods of the basic
    parameters, of housed scintillators, such as:<br />\r\n- the direct method is
    applicable to measure the light output of housed scintillators based on scintillation
    material. The housed scintillators certified by this method can be used as working
    standard of housed scintillators (hereinafter: working standard) when performing
    measurements by a relative method of comparison.<br />\r\n- the relative method
    of comparison with the working standard is applicable to housed scintillators
    based on the same scintillation material as the working standard.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2006. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- Title has been modified.<br />\r\n- To review the
    existing requirements and to update the terminology, definitions and normative
    references."
