abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 23026:2015 defines system engineering and management requirements
    for the life cycle of websites, including strategy, design, engineering, testing
    and validation, and management and sustainment for Intranet and Extranet environments.
    The goal of ISO/IEC/IEEE 23026:2015 is to improve the usability of informational
    websites and ease of maintenance of managed Web operations in terms of locating
    relevant and timely information, applying information security management, facilitating
    ease of use, and providing for consistent and efficient development and maintenance
    practices. It applies to those using web technology to present information and
    communications technology (ICT) information, such as user documentation for systems
    and software, life-cycle documentation for systems and software engineering projects,
    and documentation of policies, plans, and procedures for IT service management.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 23026:2015 provides requirements for website owners and website providers,
    managers responsible for establishing guidelines for website development and operations,
    for software developers and operations and maintenance staff who may be external
    or internal to the website owner's organization. It applies to websites for public
    access and for limited access, such as for users, customers, and subscribers seeking
    information on IT products and services. It includes increased emphasis on the
    human factors concerns for making information easily retrievable and usable for
    the intended audience. It focuses on vendor- and product-independent considerations.
