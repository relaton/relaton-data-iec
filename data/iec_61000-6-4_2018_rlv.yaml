abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-6-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61000-6-4:2018
    for emission requirements applies to electrical and electronic equipment intended
    for use within the environment existing at industrial (see 3.1.12) locations.
    This document does not apply to equipment that fall within the scope of IEC 61000-6-3.
    The environments encompassed by this document cover both indoor and outdoor locations.
    Emission requirements in the frequency range 9 kHz to 400 GHz are covered in this
    document and have been selected to provide an adequate level of protection of
    radio reception in the defined electromagnetic environment. No measurement needs
    to be performed at frequencies where no requirement is specified. These requirements
    are considered essential to provide an adequate level of protection to radio services.
    Not all disturbance phenomena have been included for testing purposes but only
    those considered relevant for the equipment intended to operate within the environments
    included within this document. Requirements are specified for each port considered.
    This generic EMC emission standard is to be used where no applicable product or
    product-family EMC emission standard is available. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2006 and Amendment 1:2010 This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) possible future
    requirements on DC ports;<br />\r\nb) possible future radiated polarity specific
    emission limits within a FAR;<br />\r\nc) the definition of which average detector
    is used for emission measurements at frequencies above 1GHz and that results using
    a peak detector are acceptable for all measurements;<br />\r\nd) the definition
    of different EUT test arrangements.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords: emission standard
