abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63493-1:2025 specifies the main parameters to facilitate interchangeability
    or at least to define some frame conditions of MV bushings:<br />\r\n- with Um
    from 12 kV up to and including 52 kV;<br />\r\n- Ir from 630 A up to and including
    3 150 A.<br />\r\nThis document deals with non-capacitance graded bushings for
    Power Transformers, according to the IEC 60076 series (usually for transformer
    with conservator).<br />\r\nIn this document only liquid to air bushings are considered.
    Bushings of liquid-to-liquid and air-to-air type and bushings for transformers
    with air-cushion in tank are not considered.<br />\r\nMV is considered up to 52
    kV; this value is used to cover specific insulation levels or for high pollution
    levels, even if the field of application is very restricted.<br />\r\nBoth solutions
    with external insulation in porcelain and polymeric can be used and need to enable
    interchangeability (in terms of mechanical and electrical performance)."
