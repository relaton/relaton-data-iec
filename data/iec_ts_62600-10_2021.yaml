abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-10:2021 provide uniform methodologies for the design and
    assessment of mooring systems for floating Marine Energy Converters (MECs) (as
    defined in the TC 114 scope). It is intended to be applied at various stages,
    from mooring system assessment to design, installation and maintenance of floating
    Marine Energy Converters plants.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to mooring
    systems for floating Marine Energy Converters units of any size or type in any
    open water conditions. Some aspects of the mooring system design process are more
    detailed in existing and well-established mooring standards. The intent of this
    document is to highlight the different requirements of Marine Energy Converters
    and not duplicate existing standards or processes. This document defines rules
    and assessment procedures for the design, installation and maintenance of mooring
    system with respect to technical requirements for floating marine energy converters.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2015. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. Added specific Design Load Cases in alignment
    with 62600-2.<br />\r\nb. Added additional robustness check requirements.<br />\r\nc.
    Rearranged document for ease of use and alignment with 62600-2.<br />\r\nd. Added
    additional informative clauses on mooring materials."
