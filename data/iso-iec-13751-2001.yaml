    <p>This International Standard defines the programming language APL and the environment</p>
    <p>in which APL programs are executed. Its purpose is to facilitate interchange and promote</p>
    <p>portability of APL programs and programming skills. This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>the syntax and semantics of APL programs and the characteristics of the environment in</p>
    <p>which APL programs are executed.</p>
    <p>It also specifies requirements for conformance to this International Standard, including the</p>
    <p>publication of values and characteristics of implementation properties so that conforming</p>
    <p>implementations can be meaningfully compared.</p>
    <p>This International Standard does not specify:</p>
    <p><b>? </b>implementation properties that are likely to vary with the particular equipment or</p>
    <p>operating system used;</p>
    <p><b>? </b>required values for implementation limits such as APL workspace size or numeric</p>
    <p>precision;</p>
    <p><b>? </b>the data structures used to represent APL objects;</p>
    <p><b>? </b>the facilities available through shared variables.</p>
