abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 11801-9906:2020(E) covers channel specifications, for channels
    constructed from balanced 1 pair cabling components, primarily intended for use
    in industrial automation and process control applications.<br />\r\nThe channel
    specifications are consistent with corresponding IEEE 802.3 single-pair Ethernet
    (SPE) applications and are referenced from link segment specifications in the
    following IEEE SPE physical layer specifications:<br />\r\n• ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/AMD4,
    1 000 Mb/s: 1000BASE T1 Type A, ≤ 15 m, 1000BASE T1 Type B, ≤ 40 m;<br />\r\n•
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2017/AMD1, 100 Mb/s: 100BASE T1, ≤ 15 m;<br />\r\n• IEEE 802.3cg,
    10 Mb/s: 10BASE T1S, ≤ 15 m; 10BASE T1L, ≤ 1 000 m.<br />\r\nThe channel component
    specifications are referenced according to corresponding IEC balanced 1 pair cable
    and connector specifications.<br />\r\nChannel specifications include IL, RL,
    TCL, coupling attenuation, and alien crosstalk parameters specifications.<br />\r\nChannel
    EMC related specifications include electromagnetic isolation levels E1, E2 and
    E3, which are defined according to the MICE standard environmental characterization
    system specified in ISO/IEC 11801-1"
