  content: "IEC/TS 62882:2020(E) which is a Technical Specification, provides pressure
    fluctuation transposition methods for Francis turbines and pump-turbines operating
    as turbines, including:<br />\r\n- description of pressure fluctuations, the phenomena
    causing them and the related problems;<br />\r\n- characterization of the phenomena
    covered by this document, including but not limited to inter-blade vortices, draft
    tube vortices rope and rotor-stator interaction;<br />\r\n- demonstration that
    both operating conditions and Thoma numbers (cavitation conditions) are primary
    parameters influencing pressure fluctuations;<br />\r\n- recommendation of ways
    to measure and analyse pressure fluctuations;<br />\r\n- identification of potential
    resonances in test rigs and prototypes;<br />\r\n- identification of methods,
    to transpose the measurement results from model to prototype or provide ways to
    predict pressure fluctuations in prototypes based on statistics or experience;<br
    />\r\n- recommendation of a data acquisition system, including the type and mounting
    position of model and prototype transducers and to define the similitude condition
    between model and prototype;<br />\r\n- presentation of pressure fluctuation measurements
    comparing the model turbine and the corresponding prototype;<br />\r\n- discussion
    of parameters used for the transposition from model to prototype, for example,
    the peak to peak value at 97 % confidence interval, the RMS value or the standard
    deviation in the time domain and the relation of main frequency and the rotational
    frequency in the frequency domain obtained by FFT;<br />\r\n- discussion of the
    uncertainty of the pressure fluctuation transposition from model to prototype;<br
    />\r\n- discussion of factors which influence the transposition, including those
    which cannot be simulated on the model test rig such as waterway system and mechanical
    system;<br />\r\n- establishment of the transposition methods for different types
    of pressure fluctuations;<br />\r\n- suggestion of possible methods for mitigating
    pressure fluctuation;<br />\r\n- definition of the limitations of the specification.<br
    />\r\nThis document is limited to normal operation conditions. Hydraulic stability
    phenomena related to von Karman vortices, transients, runaway speed and speed
    no load are excluded from this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides means
    to identify potential resonances in model test rigs and prototype turbines. Scaling-up
    resonance conditions are not treated in this document. When resonance exists,
    the transposition methods identified in this document do not apply. Under these
    conditions, the relationship between model and prototype pressure fluctuations
    cannot be determined.<br />\r\nThis document is concerned neither with the structural
    details of the machines nor the mechanical properties of their components, so
    long as these characteristics do not affect model pressure fluctuations or the
    relationship between model and prototype pressure fluctuations."
