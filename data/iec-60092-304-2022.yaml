  content: "IEC 60092-304:2022 specifies special provisions to power electronic converters
    and systems, using semiconductor elements for use in ships. The conversion may
    be from AC to DC, from DC to AC, from DC to DC or from AC to AC with a rated output
    power greater than 1 kW.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to semiconductor
    converters used in electrical propulsion plant. For semiconductors converters
    used in electrical propulsion plant, see IEC 60092-501."
