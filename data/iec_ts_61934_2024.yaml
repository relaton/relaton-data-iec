abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61934:2024 is applicable to the off-line electrical measurement
    of partial discharges (PDs) that occur in electrical insulation systems (EISs)
    when stressed by repetitive voltage impulses generated from power electronics
    devices.<br />\r\nTypical applications are EISs belonging to apparatus driven
    by power electronics, such as motors, inductive reactors, wind turbine generators
    and the power electronics modules themselves.<br />\r\nNOTE Use of this document
    with specific products can require the application of additional procedures.<br
    />\r\nExcluded from the scope of this document are:<br />\r\n- methods based on
    optical or ultrasonic PD detection,<br />\r\n- fields of application for PD measurements
    when stressed by non-repetitive impulse voltages such as lightning impulse or
    switching impulses from switchgear.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    background information on the progress being made in the field of power electronics
    including the introduction of wide band gap semiconductor devices has been added
    to the Introduction;<br />\r\nb) voltage impulse generators; the parameter values
    of the voltage impulse waveform have been modified to reflect application of wide
    band gap semiconductor devices.<br />\r\nc) PD detection methods; charge-based
    measurements are not described in this third edition nor are source-controlled
    gating techniques to suppress external noise.<br />\r\nd) Since the previous edition
    in 2011, there have been significant technical advances in this field as evidenced
    by several hundreds of publications. Consequently, the Bibliography in the 2011
    edition has been deleted in this third edition."
