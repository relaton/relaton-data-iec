abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability
    Maturity Model® (SSE-CMM®), which describes the essential characteristics of an
    organization's security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security
    engineering. ISO/IEC 21827:2008 does not prescribe a particular process or sequence,
    but captures practices generally observed in industry. The model is a standard
    metric for security engineering practices covering the following:</p><ul><li>the
    entire life cycle, including development, operation, maintenance and decommissioning
    activities;</li><li>the whole organization, including management, organizational
    and engineering activities;</li><li>concurrent interactions with other disciplines,
    such as system, software, hardware, human factors and test engineering; system
    management, operation and maintenance;</li><li>interactions with other organizations,
    including acquisition, system management, certification, accreditation and evaluation.</li></ul><p>The
    objective is to facilitate an increase of maturity of the security engineering
    processes within the organization. The SSE-CMM® is related to other CMMs which
    focus on different engineering disciplines and topic areas and can be used in
    combination or conjunction with them.</p>"
