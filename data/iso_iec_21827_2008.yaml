abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21827:2008 specifies the Systems Security Engineering - Capability Maturity Model®
    (SSE-CMM®), which describes the essential characteristics of an organization's
    security engineering process that must exist to ensure good security engineering.
    ISO/IEC 21827:2008 does not prescribe a particular process or sequence, but captures
    practices generally observed in industry. The model is a standard metric for security
    engineering practices covering the following:<br />\r\n- the entire life cycle,
    including development, operation, maintenance and decommissioning activities;<br
    />\r\n- the whole organization, including management, organizational and engineering
    activities;<br />\r\n- concurrent interactions with other disciplines, such as
    system, software, hardware, human factors and test engineering; system management,
    operation and maintenance;<br />\r\n- interactions with other organizations, including
    acquisition, system management, certification, accreditation and evaluation.<br
    /><br /><br />\r\nThe objective is to facilitate an increase of maturity of the
    security engineering processes within the organization. The SSE-CMM® is related
    to other CMMs which focus on different engineering disciplines and topic areas
    and can be used in combination or conjunction with them."
