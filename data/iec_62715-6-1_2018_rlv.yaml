abstract:
- content: "IEC 62715-6-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 62715-6-1:2018 defines
    the standard test methods to evaluate the mechanical stability of flexible display
    modules, specifically mechanical stability against deformation, such as bending,
    rolling, twisting, and stretching. Display modules include displays such as LCD,
    e-paper, and OLED. This document takes into account, wherever possible, the mechanical
    test methods outlined under mechanical stress. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) changed the part title to differentiate
    it from other parts;<br />\r\nb) added new bending testing methods;<br />\r\nc)
    added detailed testing procedures.</p>"
