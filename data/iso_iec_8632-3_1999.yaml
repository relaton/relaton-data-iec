abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    8632-3:1999 This part of ISO/IEC 8632 specifies a binary encoding of the Computer
    Graphics Metafile. For each of the elements specified in ISO/IEC 8632-1, this
    part specifies an encoding in terms of data types.<br />\r\nFor each of these
    data types, an explicit representation in terms of bits, octets and words is specified.
    For some data types, the exact representation is a function of the precisions
    being used in the metafile, as recorded in the Metafile Descriptor.<br />\r\nThis
    encoding of the Computer Graphics Metafile will, in many circumstances, minimize
    the effort required to generate and interpret the metafile."
