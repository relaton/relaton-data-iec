abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 33003:2015 sets out the requirements for process measurement
    frameworks for use in process assessment. The requirements defined in ISO/IEC
    33003:2015 form a structure which</p><p>a) establish the requirements for process
    measurement frameworks in the context of process assessment,</p><p>b) establish
    the requirements for the validation of process measurement frameworks for use
    in process assessment, and</p><p>c) establish requirements that are applicable
    to any process measurement frameworks to develop composite measures across domains.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    33003:2015 is applicable to the development of process measurement frameworks
    for any process quality characteristic across all application domains.</p>"
