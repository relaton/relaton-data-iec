abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 33003:2015 sets out the requirements for process measurement frameworks
    for use in process assessment. The requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33003:2015
    form a structure which a) establish the requirements for process measurement frameworks
    in the context of process assessment, b) establish the requirements for the validation
    of process measurement frameworks for use in process assessment, and c) establish
    requirements that are applicable to any process measurement frameworks to develop
    composite measures across domains. ISO/IEC 33003:2015 is applicable to the development
    of process measurement frameworks for any process quality characteristic across
    all application domains.
