abstract:
- content: "IEC 60512-23-3:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60512-23-3:2018. defines
    a standard test method for measuring the shielding effectiveness SE of a shielded
    connector, or of a connector not provided with integral shield once fitted with
    a shielding accessory and terminated with a screened cable. The complete assembly
    has a continuous 360° shielding capability throughout its length. This test method
    can be applied to shielded connectors and to connector accessories with shielding
    capability. The following different connector designs can be tested:<br />\r\n-
    circular connectors;<br />\r\n- rectangular connectors;<br />\r\n- connectors
    for printed boards;<br />\r\n- connector shielding accessories.<br />\r\nThis
    test method utilizes the principle that the intrinsic shielding property of the
    connector/ accessory/cable assembly is its surface transfer impedance ZT which
    can be expressed as the longitudinal voltage inside the shield, relative to the
    current flow on the outside shell. This test is also suitable for measuring the
    shielding effectiveness of a connector fitted with triaxial contacts terminated
    with shielded, twisted pair cables, as used in data bus systems. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2000. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) an introduction has
    been added to provide some guidance to this document in view of concurrent test
    method 23g in the same family;<br />\r\nb) the frequency range for which this
    test method is considered reliable moved from 1 GHz to 3 GHz, to be consistent
    with Figure 7 (unchanged) and current industry practice and need;<br />\r\nc)
    update to IEC 62153-4-6:2017 of former normative reference IEC 60096-4-1:1990,
    withdrawn and incorrect (should have been IEC 61196-1:1995, also withdrawn);<br
    />\r\nd) update to current subclause numbers of IEC 62153-4-6:2017 what were the
    previous subclause numbers referenced in IEC 61196-1:1995 (wrongly attributed
    to IEC 60096-4-1:1990). For immediate understanding the title of these subclauses
    has been added;<br />\r\ne) alignment of title to the current scope of SC 48B
    (connectors) and inclusion of electrical equipment as target application of said
    connectors (per current scope of TC 48) and explicit reference to the method –
    line injection – for the measurement of transfer impedance;<br />\r\nf) symbols
    SE for shielding effectiveness and ZT for surface transfer impedance added throughout
    the document;<br />\r\ng) list of connectors to which the test method is applicable
    – previously in 3.1 – moved in scope;<br />\r\nh) former name of AECMA organization
    changed to the current ASD-STAN;<br />\r\ni) “specimen” used instead of “sample”
    throughout the document;<br />\r\nj) clarification in the title of what transfer
    impedance is described in Table 3 and editorial improvement of the same;<br />\r\nk)
    “dielectric constant” changed into the updated term “relative permittivity”;<br
    />\r\nl) added a note to warn about the fact that this test method requires in
    6.6 a TDR with more stringent rise time of less than 100 ps than the value of
    less than 350 ps specified both in IEC 62153-4-6 and in EN 50289-1-6 for the similar
    line injection method applied to screened cables, whereas test 23g of IEC 60512-23-7
    specifies for the same purpose a TDR with a rise time of less than 200 ps;<br
    />\r\nm) adoption of term “connector housing” [IEV 581-27-10] instead of “shell”
    to address the connector accessory providing the shielding;<br />\r\nn) title
    “Transfer impedance ZT [Ω]” added to the ordinate axis on the left side of double
    log diagram of Figure 7;<br />\r\no) explanatory note to clarify the conversion
    formula for SE from ZT added.<br />\r\nKey words: Connectors, Screening and Filtering
    Tests, Shielding Effectiveness</p>"
