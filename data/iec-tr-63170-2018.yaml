  content: "IEC/TR 63170:2018(E) is a Technical Report. This document describes the
    state of the art measurement techniques and test approaches for evaluating the
    local and spatial-average incident power density of wireless devices operating
    in close proximity to the users between 6 GHz and 100 GHz.<br />\r\nIn particular,
    this document provides guidance for testing portable devices in applicable operating
    position(s) near the human body, such as mobile phones, tablets, wearable devices,
    etc. The methods described in this document may also apply to exposures in close
    proximity to base stations.<br />\r\nThis document also gives guidance on how
    to assess exposure from multiple simultaneous transmitters operating below and
    above 6 GHz (including combined exposure of SAR and power density).<br />\r\nKey
