abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    specifies a test method to evaluate the interference rejection performance of
    UHF RFID interrogators covered by ISO/IEC 18000-63, and specifies the general
    requirements and test requirements of that test method.</p><p class="Note">NOTE
    The interference rejection test method of this document is different to the one
    in ISO/IEC 18046-3:2020, 8.5. This document covers interference effects between
    the tags and a heterogeneous (diverse content) wireless system. ISO/IEC 18046-3
    covers interference effect between tags and homogeneous (same content) wireless
    systems.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This test method enables the comparison of
    the relative interference rejection performance among UHF RFID interrogators under
    a single wireless interference environment. In addition, this document can be
    used in a benchmarking test, according to requirements in a given application
    or service.</p>
