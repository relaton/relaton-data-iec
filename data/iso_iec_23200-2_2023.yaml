abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23200-2:2023 This document specifies a test method to evaluate
    the interference rejection performance of UHF RFID interrogators covered by ISO/IEC
    18000-63, and specifies the general requirements and test requirements of that
    test method.<br />\r\nNOTE The interference rejection test method of this document
    is different to the one in ISO/IEC 18046-3:2020, 8.5. This document covers interference
    effects between the tags and a heterogeneous (diverse content) wireless system.
    ISO/IEC 18046-3 covers interference effect between tags and homogeneous (same
    content) wireless systems.<br />\r\nThis test method enables the comparison of
    the relative interference rejection performance among UHF RFID interrogators under
    a single wireless interference environment. In addition, this document can be
    used in a benchmarking test, according to requirements in a given application
    or service."
