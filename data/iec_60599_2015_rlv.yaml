abstract:
- content: "IEC 60599:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60599:2015 describes
    how the concentrations of dissolved gases or free gases may be interpreted to
    diagnose the condition of oil-filled electrical equipment in service and suggest
    future action. This standard is applicable to electrical equipment filled with
    mineral insulating oil and insulated with cellulosic paper or pressboard-based
    solid insulation. Information about specific types of equipment such as transformers
    (power, instrument, industrial, railways, distribution), reactors, bushings, switchgear
    and oil-filled cables is given only as an indication in the application notes.
    This standard may be applied, but only with caution, to other liquid-solid insulating
    systems. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 1999 and Amendment 1:2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of 5.5, 6.1, 7, 8, 9, 10, A.2.6, A.3, A.7;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of new sub-clause 4.3;<br />\r\nc) expansion of the Bibliography;<br
    />\r\nd) revision of Figure 1;<br />\r\ne) addition of Figure B.4."
