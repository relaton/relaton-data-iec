abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010 is an exemplar implementation plan providing
    guidance to service providers on how to implement a service management system
    to fulfil the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1 or for service providers who are
    planning service improvements and intending to use ISO/IEC 20000 as a business
    goal. It could also be useful for those advising service providers on how to best
    achieve the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010 includes
    advice for service providers on a suitable order in which to plan and implement
    improvements. It is suggested that a generic three-phase approach is used to implement
    a service management system. The phased approach provides a structured framework
    to prioritize and manage the implementation activities.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 20000-5:2010
    includes advice on development of a business case, the start up project, and a
    list of the main activities required to implement ISO/IEC 20000-1 successfully
    for each phase. It also provides supporting information, advice and guidance that
    may be useful for the implementation project, including developing objectives,
    developing policies, document and record management and sample process documentation.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 20000-5:2010 is for guidance only. The service provider has the option of choosing
    their own implementation sequence to implement a service management system.</p>"
