abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    Open-edi Reference Model (ISO/IEC 14662:2010, Clause 4) states:<br />\r\n\"<em>The
    intention is that the sending, by an Open-edi Party, of information from a scenario,
    conforming to Open-edi standards, shall allow the acceptance and processing of
    that information in the context of that scenario by one or more Open-edi Parties
    by reference to the scenario and without the need for agreement. However, the
    legal requirements and/or liabilities resulting from the engagement of an organization
    in any Open-edi transaction may be conditioned by the competent legal environment(s)
    or the formation of a legal interchange agreement between the participating organizations.
    Open-edi Parties need to observe rule-based behaviour and possess the ability
    to make commitments in Open-edi (e.g., business, operational, technical, legal,
    and/or audit perspectives).</em>\"<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-1:2011 addresses the
    fundamental requirements of the commercial and legal frameworks and their environments
    on business transactions, and also integrates the requirements of the information
    technology and telecommunications environments.<br />\r\nIn addition to the existing
    strategic directions of \"portability\" and \"interoperability\", the added strategic
    direction of ISO/IEC JTC 1 of \"cultural adaptability\" is supported in ISO/IEC
    15944-1:2011. It also supports requirements arising from the public policy/consumer
    environment, cross-sectorial requirements and the need to address horizontal issues.
    It integrates these different sets of requirements.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-1:2011
    allows constraints [which include legal requirements, commercial and/or international
    trade and contract terms, public policy (e.g. privacy/data protection, product
    or service labelling, consumer protection), laws and regulations] to be defined
    and clearly integrated into Open-edi through the BOV. This means that terms and
    definitions in ISO/IEC 15944-1:2011 serve as a common bridge between these different
    sets of business operational requirements, allowing the integration of code sets
    and rules defining these requirements to be integrated into business processes
    electronically.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-1:2011 contains a methodology and tool
    for specifying common business practices as parts of common business transactions
    in the form of scenarios, scenario attributes, roles, Information Bundles and
    Semantic Components. It achieves this by 1) developing standard computer processable
    specifications of common business rules and practices as scenarios and scenario
    components; and thus 2) maximizing the re-use of these components in business
    transactions."
