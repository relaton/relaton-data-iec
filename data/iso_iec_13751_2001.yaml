abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines the programming language APL and
    the environment</p><p>in which APL programs are executed. Its purpose is to facilitate
    interchange and promote</p><p>portability of APL programs and programming skills.
    This International Standard specifies</p><p>the syntax and semantics of APL programs
    and the characteristics of the environment in</p><p>which APL programs are executed.</p><p>It
    also specifies requirements for conformance to this International Standard, including
    the</p><p>publication of values and characteristics of implementation properties
    so that conforming</p><p>implementations can be meaningfully compared.</p><p>This
    International Standard does not specify:</p><p><strong>?</strong>implementation
    properties that are likely to vary with the particular equipment or</p><p>operating
    system used;</p><p><strong>?</strong>required values for implementation limits
    such as APL workspace size or numeric</p><p>precision;</p><p><strong>?</strong>the
    data structures used to represent APL objects;</p><p><strong>?</strong>the facilities
    available through shared variables.</p>"
