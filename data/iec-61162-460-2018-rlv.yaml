  content: "IEC 61162-460:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61162-460:2018
    is an add-on to IEC 61162-450 where higher safety and security standards are needed,
    for example due to higher exposure to external threats or to improve network integrity.
    This document provides requirements and test methods for equipment to be used
    in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network as well as requirements for the network
    itself and requirements for interconnection from the network to other networks.
    This document also contains requirements for a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant
    network.<br />\r\nThis document does not introduce new application level protocol
    requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition of IEC 61162-460 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) 460-Switches and 460-Forwarders are required to implement IGMP snooping;<br
    />\r\nb) connection between secure and non-secure areas requires a 460-Forwarder
    as an isolation element;<br />\r\nc) SFI collision detection added as function
    of network monitoring;<br />\r\nd) 460-Gateway and 460-Wireless gateway are no
    longer required to report to the network monitoring;<br />\r\ne) all alerts from
    network monitoring have standardized alert identifiers."
