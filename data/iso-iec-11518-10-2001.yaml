  content: 'Specifies a physical-level, point-to-point, full-duplex, link interface
    for reliable, flow-controlled transmission of user data at 6 400 Mbit&#x2F;s per
    direction, across distances of up to 1 km. Characteristics of a HIPPI-6400-PH
    physical-layer interface include: - user data transfer bandwidth of 6 400 Mbit&#x2F;s
    (800 MByte&#x2F;s); - a full-duplex link capable of independent full-bandwidth
    transfers in both directions simultaneously; - four virtual circuits providing
    a limited multiplexing capability; - a fixed-size transfer unit, i.e., a 32-byte
    micropacket, for hardware efficiency; - a small transfer unit resulting in low
    latency for short Messages, and a component for large transfers; - credit-based
    flow control that prevents buffer overflow; - end-to-end, as well as link-to-link,
    checksums; - automatic retransmission to correct flawed data providing guaranteed,
    in-order, reliable, data delivery; - an a.c. coupled parallel electrical interface
    for driving parallel copper cable over limited distances; - a parallel electrical
    interface for driving a local optical interface for longer distances.'
