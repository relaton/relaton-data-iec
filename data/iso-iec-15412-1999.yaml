    <p>For the purposes of this International Standard, a portable computer is defined as a computer with a screen and an</p>
    <p>attached keyboard that is capable of running on battery power for extended periods of time and is relatively easy to</p>
    <p>transport from one location to another by a single individual.</p>
    <p>This International Standard gives design guidance for product designers; this International Standard indicates those</p>
    <p>requirements and recommendations contained in ISO/IEC 9995 and ISO 9241-4:1998 that are to be considered in</p>
    <p>designing portable computers keyboards.</p>
    <p>This International Standard strives to maintain consistency, as far as practical, between keyboards for portable</p>
    <p>computers and desktop computers. To accomplish this goal, this International Standard has reviewed ISO/IEC 9995</p>
    <p>and ISO 9241-4:1998 to identify those design features of these two base standards which are to be followed, which</p>
    <p>are exempted from this International Standard and which are permitted variations.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is intended primarily to apply to full size portable keyboards (e.g. A4). It may also apply</p>
    <p>to other keyboards outside this scope. ISO 9241-4 contains a proposed alternative method for conformance by a</p>
    <p>test based on user performance and subjective rating scales.</p>
    <p>This International Standard consists of two major categories of guidelines for portable computers:</p>
    <p>1. Layout characteristics</p>
    <p>2. Physical (ergonomic) characteristics</p>
