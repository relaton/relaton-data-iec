abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-8-7:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60404-8-7:2017
    defines the grades of cold-rolled grain-oriented electrical steel strip and sheet
    in nominal thicknesses of 0,23 mm, 0,27 mm, 0,30 mm and 0,35 mm. In particular,
    it gives general requirements, magnetic properties, geometric characteristics,
    tolerances and technological characteristics, as well as inspection procedures.
    This document applies to Goss textured grain-oriented electrical steel strip and
    sheet supplied in the final annealed condition in coils or sheets, and intended
    for the construction of magnetic circuits.<br />\r\nThe grades are grouped into
    two classes:<br />\r\n– conventional grades;<br />\r\n– high permeability grades,
    including grades which may be delivered in the domain refined condition. They
    correspond to Class C22 of IEC 60404-1.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n– extension of the range of electrical
    steels to include the improved grades."
