  content: "IEC GUIDE 108:2019 defines rules for dealing with horizontal functions
    and horizontal publications. This Guide is to be used in conjunction with the
    ISO/IEC Directives and with the aspect­ specific Guides.<br />\r\nThe fundamental
    concept of a horizontal publication is that it is an international publication
    (not a TS or a PAS) that is widely applicable and to be used by all relevant committees
    and that has undergone an enhanced approval process as described in this document.<br
    />\r\nIn this Guide:<br />\r\n- the term \"committees\" includes technical committees,
    project committees, subcommittees and systems committees.<br />\r\n- the term
    \"publication\" includes International Standard, Technical Report, Technical Specification,
    Publicly Available Specification and Guide.<br />\r\n- the term \"product\" is
    used to refer to individual products, processes, services and combinations thereof,
    commonly known as \"systems\"."
