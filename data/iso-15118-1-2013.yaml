  content: ISO 15118 specifies the communication between Electric Vehicles (EV), including
    Battery Electric Vehicles and Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles, and the Electric
    Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE). As the communication parts of this generic equipment
    are the Electric Vehicle Communication Controller (EVCC) and the Supply Equipment
    Communication Controller (SECC), ISO 15118 describes the communication between
    these components. Although ISO 15118 is oriented to the charging of electric road
    vehicles, it is open for other vehicles as well. ISO 15118-1:2013 specifies terms
    and definitions, general requirements and use cases as the basis for the other
    parts of ISO 15118. It provides a general overview and a common understanding
    of aspects influencing the charge process, payment and load levelling. ISO 15118
    does not specify the vehicle internal communication between battery and charging
    equipment and the communication of the SECC to other actors and equipment (beside
    some dedicated message elements related to the charging). All connections beyond
    the SECC, and the method of message exchanging are considered to be out of the
    scope as specific use cases.
