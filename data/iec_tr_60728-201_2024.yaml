abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60728-201:2024 describes the technical background of IPTV systems
    and commercially available products related to audio, video and multimedia systems
    and equipment to enable cable operators and customers to understand current IPTV
    systems that include application, middleware, network, equipment and terminal
    devices. This document is to encourage all TA5 experts to develop new IS related
    to IPTV system over optical broadcast network. This Technical Report examines
    the mechanisms of IPTV systems developed by major standards development organizations
    (SDOs) and known national regulations. This document concludes with observations
    and recommendations for the potential future technical standards development activities
    especially for TA5 under the scope of TC 100.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this TR
    is to give cable operators an appropriate way how to adopt IPTV services with
    current FTTH system recognizing that optical system is the best solution for the
    effective transmission of 4K and 8K video signals. This TR gives an overall but
    essential information on current IPTV systems to cable operators; however, too
    much detailed information is omitted due to the limitation of document size. The
    author of this document recommends the cable operator who plans to develop IPTV
    services to study the original international standards shown in this document.
    It also describes a migration from the HFC to FTTH system for effective introduction
    to IPTV services.<br />\r\nDOCSIS 4.0 can be considered on HFC as an alternative
    way to provide 10Gbps service. If bandwidth and other constraints (without Amp,
    etc.) are cleared, the IPTV service described in this document can of course be
    provided.<br />\r\nIn addition to present international standards and recommendations,
    this document describes some major technology supporting IPTV services such as
    unicast, multicast, ABR (Adapting Bit Rate) and MPEG-DASH. The experiment of 4K
    and 8K video transmission over IP, virtual STB are also described."
