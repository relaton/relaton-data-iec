  content: "IEC 62702-1-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62702-1-1:2022
    specifies a method of data-quality assurance for writable DVD disks (hereafter
    referred to as \"disks\") which are specified for long-term data storage, and
    a data migration method which can sustain the recorded data on disks for long-term
    audio data preservation. The writable disks include recordable disks such as DVD-R,
    and +R format, and rewritable disks such as DVD-RW, +RW format and DVD-RAM. IEC
    62702-1-1:2022 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. In order to reflect the updates to ISO/IEC
    29121:2021, this edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) ISO/IEC 16963 has been identified
    as the referee test method for the estimation of lifetime;<br />\r\nb) the ambient
    conditions for the measurement of maximum data error have been added;<br />\r\nc)
    the requirements for test drives have been changed considering the use condition
    of users;<br />\r\nd) the requirements for the estimated lifetime have been defined
    more clearly;<br />\r\ne) the requirements for the periodic performance test have
    been defined more clearly."
