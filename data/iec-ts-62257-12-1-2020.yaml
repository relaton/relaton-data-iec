  content: "IEC TS 62257-12-1:2020 establishes the framework for creating a product
    specification for lamps and lighting appliances to serve as the basis for evaluating
    quality for a particular context. Product specifications include minimum requirements
    for quality standards, warranty requirements, and/or performance criteria. Products
    are compared to specifications based on test results and other information about
    the product. The product specification framework is flexible and can accommodate
    the goals of diverse organizations and institutions. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\n-
    Annex A and Annex B were combined into a single Annex A to eliminate duplicate
    tables and simplify the document."
