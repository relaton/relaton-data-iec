    to risks stemming from the global ICT supply chain to ICT products and services
    that can have an information security impact on the organizations using these
    products and services. These risks can be related to organizational as well as
    technical aspects (e.g. insertion of malicious code or presence of the counterfeit
    information technology (IT) products);</li><li>integrating information security
    processes and practices into the system and software lifecycle processes, described
    in ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207, while supporting information security controls,
    described in ISO/IEC 27002.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC 27036-3:2013 does not include
