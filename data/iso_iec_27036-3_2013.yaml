abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 27036-3:2013 provides product and service acquirers and suppliers
    in the information and communication technology (ICT) supply chain with guidance
    on: 1) gaining visibility into and managing the information security risks caused
    by physically dispersed and multi-layered ICT supply chains; 2) responding to
    risks stemming from the global ICT supply chain to ICT products and services that
    can have an information security impact on the organizations using these products
    and services. These risks can be related to organizational as well as technical
    aspects (e.g. insertion of malicious code or presence of the counterfeit information
    technology (IT) products); 3) integrating information security processes and practices
    into the system and software lifecycle processes, described in ISO/IEC 15288 and
    ISO/IEC 12207, while supporting information security controls, described in ISO/IEC
    27002. ISO/IEC 27036-3:2013 does not include business continuity management/resiliency
    issues involved with the ICT supply chain. ISO/IEC 27031 addresses business continuity.'
