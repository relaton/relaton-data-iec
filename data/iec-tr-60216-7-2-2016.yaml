  content: IEC TR 60216-7-2:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, is to validate the
    procedures of IEC TS 60216-7-1 in providing a similar temperature index to conventional
    methods used in other parts of the IEC 60216 series. These round robin test results
    do not provide statistical analysis for precisions. The round robin test focuses
    on preliminary studies to understand the evaluation and calculation procedures,
    influence on apparatus, and data variance among laboratories before determination
    of precisions.
