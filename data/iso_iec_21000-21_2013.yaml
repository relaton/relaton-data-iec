abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 21000-21:2013 specifies MPEG-21 Media Contract Ontology (MCO).</p><p>The
    MCO may be used to represent contracts for content directly or for services on
    content based on MPEG-21 technologies. This is implemented by using some of the
    classes and properties defined in ISO/IEC 21000-19 (Media Value Chain Ontology)
    and by extending its ontology.</p><p>Media Contract Ontology is able to represent
    the most common rights in contracts in the media field and the conditions appearing
    the most in those documents.</p><p>It is made of a contract core ontology, for
    implementing the most general entities, and of an extension including specific
    elements to address the most relevant information found in contracts for permitting
    the exploitation of intellectual property rights. A mechanism for defining further
    future extensions is in place.</p><p>A contract expressed with MCO may provide:</p><ul><li>the
    identification of the contract itself;</li><li>possible relationships with other
    contracts;</li><li>the parties;</li><li>a textual version of the contract;</li><li>the
    object of the contract (content or service);</li><li>the deontic-expression (permissions,
    obligations, prohibitions), with possible reference to textual clauses.</li></ul><p>There
    is support for:</p><ul><li>encryption of the whole contract or any sub-part of
    it;</li><li>inclusion of metadata to be associated to contract entities, as annotation
    properties.</li></ul><p>A document instance created according to MCO specification
    can be:</p><ul><li>a contract template;</li><li>a contract offer;</li><li>a signed
    contract (binding the parties).</li></ul><p>The MCO can also be used for representing:</p><ul><li>exploitation
    contexts (as deontic expressions);</li><li>rights situation related to specified
    content or service, also derived from multiple contracts;</li><li>any subset of
    knowledge about rights on content or service.</li></ul>"
