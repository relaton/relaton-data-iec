  content: "IEC TR 61850-7-510:2021(E), which is a technical report, is intended to
    provide explanations on how to use the Logical Nodes defined in IEC 61850-7-410
    as well as other documents in the IEC 61850 series to model complex control functions
    in power plants, including variable speed pumped storage power plants.<br />\r\nIEC
    61850-7-410 introduced the general modelling concepts of IEC 61850 for power plants.
    It is however not obvious from the standard how the modelling concepts can be
    implemented in actual power plants.<br />\r\nThis document explains how the data
    model and the concepts defined in the IEC 61850 standard can be applied in Hydro;
    both directly at the process control level, but also for data structuring and
    data exchange at a higher level. Application of the data model for Thermal is
    limited to power evacuation (in principle the extraction of the generated electrical
    power) and the prime mover shaft and bearing system. The interfaces of the fuel
    and steam valves are modelled for the purpose of process control.<br />\r\nCommunication
    services, and description of the use of mappings of the IEC 61850 data model to
    different communication protocols, are outside the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Process modelling according to IEC 61850-6:2009, including IEC 61850-6:2009/AMD1:2018.<br
    />\r\nb) Examples of application of Reference Designation System together with
    the process modelling, in particular application of IEC/ISO 81346.<br />\r\nc)
    Description of modelling related to Steam- and Gas turbines.<br />\r\nd) Annexes
    with examples of application of SCL according to the examples in the Technical
    Report.<br />\r\ne) The dynamic exchange of values by using polling, GOOSE, Reporting
    or Sampled Values is no longer included in the Technical Report."
