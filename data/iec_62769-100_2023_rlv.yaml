abstract:
- content: "IEC 62769-100:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62769-100:2023
    specifies an FDI®[1] profile of IEC 62769 for Generic Protocols. That means that
    all interfaces are defined and a host can add support for more protocols without
    changing its implementation. Nevertheless, there are some protocol specific definitions
    (PSD) that need to be specified per protocol using this profile. Annex C specifies
    what PSD need to be defined per protocol so that FDI® Device Packages, FDI® Communication
    Packages for Gateways and FDI® Communication Servers, FDI® Communication Server,
    Gateways and Devices supporting such a protocol can work together in a host not
    aware about this specific protocol."
