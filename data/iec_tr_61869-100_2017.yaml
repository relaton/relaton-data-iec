abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61869-100:2017(E) is applicable to inductive protective current
    transformers meeting the requirements of the IEC 61869-2 standard.<br />\r\nIt
    may help relay manufacturers, CT manufacturers and project engineers to understand
    how a CT responds to simplified or standardized short circuit signals. Therefore,
    it supplies advanced information to comprehend the definition of inductive current
    transformers as well as their requirements.<br />\r\nThe document aims to provide
    information for the casual user as well as for the specialist. Where necessary,
    the level of abstraction is mentioned in the document. It also discusses the question
    about the responsibilities in the design process for current transformers."
