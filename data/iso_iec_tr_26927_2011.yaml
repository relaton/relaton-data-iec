abstract:
- content: "<p>Mobility for enterprise communications is the ability for persons and
    objects (e.g. vehicles, sensors and other machines) belonging to the enterprise
    to use communication and information services regardless of changes in their physical
    location. This includes also the ability to be reached by other persons or objects
    for communications.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 26927:2011 encompasses the mobility of enterprise
    users connecting to enterprise and public IP networks using wired and wireless
    terminals for voice, data and converged services. It defines terms for different
    types of mobility, describes basic functionality in support of mobility, and lists
    common deployment scenarios. For each scenario, it identifies functional requirements
    and standardization gaps with the main focus on the management of mobility, identity,
    terminals and reachability. However, it does not provide technical solutions but
    lays the foundations for triggering standardization projects in areas where gaps
    have been identified.</p><p>More general aspects of enterprise communications
    based on Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) and interconnection with Next
    Generation Networks (NGN) are covered by ISO/IEC TR 12860, ISO/IEC TR 12861, ISO/IEC
    TR 16166 and ISO/IEC TR 16167.</p>"
