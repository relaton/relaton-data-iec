abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 26927:2011 Mobility for enterprise communications is the ability for persons
    and objects (e.g. vehicles, sensors and other machines) belonging to the enterprise
    to use communication and information services regardless of changes in their physical
    location. This includes also the ability to be reached by other persons or objects
    for communications.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 26927:2011 encompasses the mobility of
    enterprise users connecting to enterprise and public IP networks using wired and
    wireless terminals for voice, data and converged services. It defines terms for
    different types of mobility, describes basic functionality in support of mobility,
    and lists common deployment scenarios. For each scenario, it identifies functional
    requirements and standardization gaps with the main focus on the management of
    mobility, identity, terminals and reachability. However, it does not provide technical
    solutions but lays the foundations for triggering standardization projects in
    areas where gaps have been identified.<br />\r\nMore general aspects of enterprise
    communications based on Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) and interconnection
    with Next Generation Networks (NGN) are covered by ISO/IEC TR 12860, ISO/IEC TR
    12861, ISO/IEC TR 16166 and ISO/IEC TR 16167."
