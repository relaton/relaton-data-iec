    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 defines the parameters to be determined in any Standardized Air Interface Definition in the ISO/IEC 18000 series. The subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 18000 provide the specific values for definition of the Air Interface Parameters for a particular frequency or type of air interface, from which compliance (or non compliance) with ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 can be established. ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 also provides description of example conceptual architectures in which these air interfaces are often to be utilized.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 limits its scope to transactions and data exchanges across the air interface at Reference Point Delta. The means of generating and managing such transactions, other than a requirement to achieve the transactional performance determined within ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004, are outside its scope, as is the definition or specification of any supporting hardware, firmware, software or associated equipment.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 is an enabling standard that supports and promotes several RFID implementations without making conclusions about the relative technical merits of any available option for any possible application.</p>
