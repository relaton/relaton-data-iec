  content: "IEC 61937-3:2017 describes the method used to convey non-linear PCM bitstreams
    encoded according to the AC-3 and enhanced AC-3 formats. This third edition of
    IEC 61937-3 cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2007. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    removal of support for enhanced AC-3 bitstreams with a sampling frequency of 32
    kHz;<br />\r\nb) updates to normative and informative references;<br />\r\nc)
    clarification of pause data-burst usage for enhanced AC-3 bitstreams.<br />\r\n<strong>This
    consolidated version consists of the third edition (2017) and its amendment 1
    (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>"
