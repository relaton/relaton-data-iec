abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-21:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60384-21:2024 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60384-21:2019
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 40 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60384-21:2024 is applicable to fixed unencapsulated surface mount
    multilayer capacitors of ceramic dielectric with a defined temperature coefficient
    (dielectric Class 1), intended for use in electronic equipment. These capacitors
    have metallized connecting pads or soldering strips and are intended to be mounted
    on printed boards, or directly onto substrates for hybrid circuits. Capacitors
    for electromagnetic interference suppression are not included but are covered
    by IEC 60384-14. The object of this document is to specify preferred ratings and
    characteristics and to select from IEC 60384-1:2021 the appropriate quality assessment
    procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance requirements
    for this type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements specified in detail
    specifications referring to this sectional specification provide specific test
    severities and requirements of an equal or higher performance level. Further information
    on the conception of generic, sectional and detail specifications can be found
    in the Introduction of IEC 60384-1:2021.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the document has been completely restructured to comply with the ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 2 and to make it more useable; tables, figures and references have been revised
    accordingly; Annex X contains all cross-references of changes in clause/subclause
    numbers;<br />\r\nb) the terms have been replaced by the letter symbols in Table
    3;<br />\r\nc) code of temperature coefficient and tolerance of C0G, U2J have
    been added in Table 4, Table 6, Table 8, Table 9, Table 11, Table 13, Table 16
    and Annex B;<br />\r\nd) the requirement in 5.5.2(visual examination) has been
    repeated in 5.9.3, 5.10.5, 5.11.4, 5.11.4, 5.13.7, 5.14.5 and 5.15.5;<br />\r\ne)
    the deflection D in the very robust designs has been added in 5.9.1;<br />\r\nf)
    Annex B has been changed informative into normative;<br />\r\ng) Clause C.5 (Test
    schedule for quality conformance inspection) has been newly added to withdraw
    the blank detail specification: IEC 60384-21-1."
