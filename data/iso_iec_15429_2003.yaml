abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15429:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Wireless Terminal Location Registration supplementary service (SS-WTLR)
    and the Wireless Terminal Information exchange additional network feature (ANF-WTINFO)
    at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges
    (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>SS-WTLR
    is a supplementary service which enables a WTM user to register at, or deregister
    from, the current location within the PISN. The ability to register at different
    locations in the PISN at different times enables the WTM user to maintain the
    provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls) at different
    access points. Deregistration is used to inform the PISN that the WTM user is
    temporarily unable to make use of the provided services (including the receipt
    of calls).</p><p>ANF-WTINFO is an additional network feature which enables transfer
    of restriction information between Home PINX and Visitor PINX. ANF-WTINFO also
    enables the Visitor PINX or Home PINX to initiate a check of the current location
    information.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Supplementary
    Service specifications and Additional Network Feature specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This
    International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 15428.</p><p>The signalling protocol for SS-WTLR and ANF-WTINFO uses
    certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services
    specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15429:2003 also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between SS-WTLR and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15429:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
