abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be  downloaded
    \ from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15429:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of
    the Wireless Terminal Location Registration supplementary service (SS-WTLR) and
    the Wireless Terminal Information exchange additional network feature (ANF-WTINFO)
    at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges
    (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br
    />\r\nSS-WTLR is a supplementary service which enables a WTM user to register
    at, or deregister from, the current location within the PISN. The ability to register
    at different locations in the PISN at different times enables the WTM user to
    maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls)
    at different access points. Deregistration is used to inform the PISN that the
    WTM user is temporarily unable to make use of the provided services (including
    the receipt of calls).<br />\r\nANF-WTINFO is an additional network feature which
    enables transfer of restriction information between Home PINX and Visitor PINX.
    ANF-WTINFO also enables the Visitor PINX or Home PINX to initiate a check of the
    current location information.<br />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.<br />\r\nSupplementary Service specifications and Additional Network
    Feature specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method
    specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This International Standard contains the stage
    3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified
    by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15428.<br />\r\nThe signalling
    protocol for SS-WTLR and ANF-WTINFO uses certain aspects of the generic procedures
    for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15429:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the
    support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-WTLR and other supplementary
    services and ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15429:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can
    interconnect to form a PISN."
