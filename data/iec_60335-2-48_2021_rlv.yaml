abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-48:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 603352-48:2021
    deals with the safety of electrically operated commercial grillers and toasters,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected
    between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances.<br />\r\nRotary
    or continuous grillers or toasters and similar appliances intended for grilling
    by radiant heat such as rotisseries, salamanders, etc., are within the scope of
    this standard. These appliances are not intended for household and similar purposes.
    They are used for commercial processing of food, also in areas open to the public,
    for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens, hospitals and in commercial
    enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries. The electrical part of appliances
    making use of other forms of energy is also within the scope of this standard.
    As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by these types of appliances.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities
    and similar authorities;<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used outdoors,
    additional requirements can be necessary.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to:<br />\r\n– appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n–
    appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– appliances for continuous mass production of food;<br />\r\n– commercial
    electric griddles and griddle grills (IEC 60335-2-38);<br />\r\n– battery-operated
    appliances;<br />\r\n– grills, toasters and similar portable cooking appliances
    for household use covered by IEC 60335-2-9 and used in the following environments
    by laymen: staff kitchen areas in shops, offices and other working environments,
    farm houses, hotels, motels and other residential type environments, bed and breakfast
    type environments.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been
    converted to normative text, modified or deleted (Clause 1, 7.15, 9.101, 11.7,
    22.101, 23.3, 27.2, 30.101);<br />\r\nc) clarifications to some test specifications
    have been made (7.101, 11.4, 15.1.1, 19, 20.1, 25.3);<br />\r\nd) introduction
    of requirements for appliances intended for use in areas open to the public, including
    external accessible surface temperatures (Clause 1, 7.12, 11.8, Table 102);<br
    />\r\ne) clarification of applicable standard for appliances for use by laymen
    (Clause 1, 7.12);<br />\r\nf) exclusion of battery-operated appliances;<br />\r\ng)
    relocation of cleaning instructions from 7.12.1 to 7.12;<br />\r\nh) relocation
    of 24.101 to 22.104;<br />\r\ni) additional instructional requirements in 7.12;<br
    />\r\nj) conciliation of the text of IEC 60335-2-48 with other standards under
    IEC/TC61/MT32.<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest
    edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in
    that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established
    on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
