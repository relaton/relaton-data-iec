abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62679-5-1:2017, which is a technical report, specifies the legibility
    in terms of contrast, spatial frequency, and reflection of the screen as a function
    of the physical parameters of an electronic paper display (EPD). This legibility
    evaluation model is introduced through both subjective and objective assessments.
    The scope of this document is restricted to EPDs using segment, passive, and active
    matrixes with monochromatic type displays.
