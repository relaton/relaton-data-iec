    <p>ISO/IEC 21000 (MPEG-21) defines an open framework for multimedia delivery and consumption, with both the content creator and content consumer as focal points. The vision for MPEG-21 is to define a multimedia framework to <i>enable transparent and augmented use of multimedia resources across a wide range of networks and devices </i>used by different communities.</p>
    <p>The basic architectural concept in MPEG-21 is the Digital Item. Digital Items are structured digital objects, including a standard representation and identification, and metadata. They are the basic unit of transaction in the MPEG-21 framework. Many MPEG-21 applications have the requirement to uniquely identify<i> </i>Digital Items.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 21000-3:2003 provides a simple but flexible mechanism to:</p>
    <ul><li>Uniquely identify Digital Items and parts thereof (including resources);</li><li>Uniquely identify IP related to the Digital Items (and parts thereof), for example abstractions;</li><li>Uniquely identify Description Schemes;</li><li>Use identifiers to link Digital Items with related information such as descriptive metadata (non-normative).</li></ul>
    <p>The DII specification does <i>not </i>specify new identification systems for the content elements for which identification and description schemes already exist and are in use.</p>
    <p>Identifiers covered by this specification can be associated with Digital Items by including them in a specific place in the Digital Item Declaration (ISO/IEC 21000-2).</p>
