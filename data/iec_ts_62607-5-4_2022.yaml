abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-5-4:2022 specifies the measuring method of the band gap energy
    of a nanomaterial using electron energy loss data of transmission electron microscope.<br
    />\r\nThe method specified in this document is applicable to semiconducting and
    insulating nanomaterials to estimate the band gap.<br />\r\nThe measurement to
    get reliable data is performed under the consistent conditions of TEM observation
    and specimen thickness. The applicable measurement range of band gap energy is
    more than 2 eV."
