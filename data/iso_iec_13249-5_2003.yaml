abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003:</p><ul><li>introduces the still image part of
    ISO/IEC 13249 (all parts);</li><li>gives the references necessary for ISO/IEC
    13249-5:2003;</li><li>defines notations and conventions specific to ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003;</li><li>defines
    concepts specific to ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003;</li><li>defines the still image user-defined
    types and their associated routines.</li></ul><p>The still image user-defined
    types defined in ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 adhere to the following.</p><ul><li>A still
    image user-defined type is generic to image handling. It addresses the need to
    store, manage and retrieve information based on aspects of inherent image characteristics
    such as height, width and format and based on image features such as average color,
    color histogram, positional color and texture. It also addresses the need to employ
    manipulation such as rotation, scaling as well as similarity assessment.</li><li>A
    still image user-defined type does not redefine the database language SQL directly
    or in combination with another still image data type.</li></ul><p>The still image
    user-defined types are applicable to all different image formats. However, not
    all functionality can be used with all known still image formats.</p><p>An implementation
    of ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 may exist in environments that also support information
    and content management, decision support, data mining and data warehousing systems.</p><p>Application
    areas addressed by implementations of ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 include, but are not
    restricted to, graphics, multimedia, scientific research and medicine.</p>"
