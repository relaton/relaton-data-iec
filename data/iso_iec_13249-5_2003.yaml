abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003:introduces the still image part of ISO/IEC 13249 (all
    parts);gives the references necessary for ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003;defines notations
    and conventions specific to ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003;defines concepts specific to
    ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003;defines the still image user-defined types and their associated
    routines.The still image user-defined types defined in ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 adhere
    to the following.A still image user-defined type is generic to image handling.
    It addresses the need to store, manage and retrieve information based on aspects
    of inherent image characteristics such as height, width and format and based on
    image features such as average color, color histogram, positional color and texture.
    It also addresses the need to employ manipulation such as rotation, scaling as
    well as similarity assessment.A still image user-defined type does not redefine
    the database language SQL directly or in combination with another still image
    data type.The still image user-defined types are applicable to all different image
    formats. However, not all functionality can be used with all known still image
    formats.An implementation of ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 may exist in environments that
    also support information and content management, decision support, data mining
    and data warehousing systems.Application areas addressed by implementations of
    ISO/IEC 13249-5:2003 include, but are not restricted to, graphics, multimedia,
    scientific research and medicine.
