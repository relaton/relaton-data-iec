abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19794-7:2007 specifies two data interchange formats for signature/sign
    behavioural data captured in the form of time series using devices such as digitizing
    tablets or advanced pen systems. One data interchange format is for general use
    and the other one is a compact format for use with smart cards or other tokens.
    Both data interchange formats can be used for both acquired signature/sign samples
    (serving as a starting point for feature extraction) and for time-series features
    (to be compared directly by time-series based comparison algorithms). Abstract
    syntax notation one (ASN.1) specifications of the data interchange formats and
    encoding instructions are provided in an informative annex.
