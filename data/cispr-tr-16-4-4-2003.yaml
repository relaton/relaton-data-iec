    This technical report describes the calculation of limits for disturbance field strength and disturbance voltage for the measurement on the test site on the basis of models for the generation of disturbance for radiation coupling respectively for mains coupling.

    This first edition of CISPR 16-4-4, together with CISPR 16-4-1, CISPR 16-4-3 and the second edition of CISPR 16-3, cancels and replaces the first edition of CISPR 16-3, published in 2000, and its amendment 1 (2002). It contains the relevant clauses of CISPR 16-3 without technical changes.
