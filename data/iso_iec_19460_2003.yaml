abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19460:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Single Step
    Call Transfer supplementary service (SS-SSCT) at the Q reference point between
    Private Integrated Network services eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within
    a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br /><br />\r\nSS-SSCT is a supplementary
    service which enables a user, user A, to transform an existing call between user
    A and user B into a new call between user B and a user C whereby user A does not
    have a call established with user C prior to call transfer.<br />\r\nThe Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC
    19460:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    19459.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-SSCT operates on top of the signalling
    protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572,
    and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary
    services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19460:2003 also specifies
    additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at
    the Q reference point between Single Step Call Transfer and other supplementary
    services and ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19460:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can
    interconnect to form a PISN."
