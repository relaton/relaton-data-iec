abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23912:2005 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of an 80 mm and a 120 mm DVD Recordable disk to enable the interchange of such
    disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and the recorded
    signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format
    of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing for information
    interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD Recordable
    (DVD-R) disk.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23912:2005 specifies:</p><p>- 80 mm and 120 mm nominal
    diameter disks that may be either single or double sided;</p><p>- the conditions
    for conformance;</p><p>- the environments in which the disk is to be operated
    and stored;</p><p>- the mechanical and physical characteristics of the disk, so
    as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;</p><p>-
    the format of the pre-recorded information on an unrecorded disk, including the
    physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and
    the coding method used;</p><p>- the format of the data and the recorded information
    on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the
    error correcting codes and the coding method used;</p><p>- the characteristics
    of the signals from pre-recorded and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data
    processing systems to read the pre-recorded information and to write to the disks;
    and</p><p>- the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling
    data processing systems to read the data from the disk.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23912:2005
    provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems.</p>"
