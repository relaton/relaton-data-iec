abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 23912:2005 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of an 80 mm and a 120 mm DVD Recordable disk to enable the interchange of such
    disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and the recorded
    signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format
    of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing for information
    interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD Recordable
    (DVD-R) disk.   ISO/IEC 23912:2005 specifies:   - 80 mm and 120 mm nominal diameter
    disks that may be either single or double sided;   - the conditions for conformance;   -
    the environments in which the disk is to be operated and stored;   - the mechanical
    and physical characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    between data processing systems;   - the format of the pre-recorded information
    on an unrecorded disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors,
    the error correcting codes and the coding method used;   - the format of the data
    and the recorded information on the disk, including the physical disposition of
    the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method used;   -
    the characteristics of the signals from pre-recorded and unrecorded areas on the
    disk, enabling data processing systems to read the pre-recorded information and
    to write to the disks; and   - the characteristics of the signals recorded on
    the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the data from the disk.   ISO/IEC
    23912:2005 provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with
    a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems.'
