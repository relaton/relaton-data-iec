  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3-1:2015 contains the Management Information Base
    (MIB) module specifications for IEEE Std 802.3, also known as Ethernet. It includes
    the Structure of Management Information Version 2 (SMIv2) MIB module specifications
    formerly produced and published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF),
    and the managed object branch and leaf assignments provided in the Guidelines
    for the Definition of Managed Objects (GDMO) MIB modules formerly specified within
    IEEE Std 802.3, as well as extensions resulting from recent amendments to IEEE
    Std 802.3. The SMIv2 MIB modules are intended for use with the Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP), commonly used to manage Ethernet.</p>"
