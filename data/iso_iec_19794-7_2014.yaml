abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014 specifies data interchange formats for signature/sign
    behavioural data captured in the form of a multi-dimensional time series using
    devices such as digitizing tablets or advanced pen systems. The data interchange
    formats are generic, in that they may be applied and used in a wide range of application
    areas where handwritten signs or signatures are involved. No application-specific
    requirements or features are addressed in ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014. ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014
    contains 1) a description of what data may be captured, 2) three data formats
    for containing the data: 1) a full format for general use, 2) a compression format
    capable of holding the same amount of information as the full format but in compressed
    form, and 3) a compact format for use with smart cards and other tokens that does
    not require compression/decompression but conveys less information than the full
    format, and 3) examples of data record contents and best practices in capture.
    Specifying which of the format types and which options defined in ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014
    are to be applied in a particular application is out of scope; this needs to be
    defined in application-specific requirements specifications or application profiles.
    It is advisable that cryptographic techniques be used to protect the authenticity,
    integrity, and confidentiality of stored and transmitted biometric data; yet such
    provisions are beyond the scope of ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014. ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014
    also specifies elements of conformance testing methodology, test assertions, and
    test procedures as applicable to ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014. It establishes test assertions
    on the structure and internal consistency of the signature/sign time series data
    formats defined in ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014 (type A level 1 and 2 as defined in ISO/IEC
    19794-1:2011/Amd1), and semantic test assertions (type A level 3 as defined in
    ISO/IEC 19794-1:2011/Amd1). The conformance testing methodology specified in ISO/IEC
    19794-7:2014 does not establish: - tests of other characteristics of biometric
    products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance,
    robustness, security), - tests of conformance of systems that do not produce data
    records claimed to conform to the requirements of ISO/IEC 19794-7:2014.'
