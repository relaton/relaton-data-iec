  content: This is one of a set of standards describing the characteristics of a specific
    home control system called the Home Electronic System, HES. It specifies the characteristics
    of the Universal Interface (UI) Class 1 that connects devices to the home network
    in an HES for control applications; it informs as to the usefulness of the principles
    of a UI and forms a basis for new work in this field. This standard specifies
    a generic interface for a device to connect to a home control network via a Network
    Adaptor Unit. The home control network signals may be carried on the cabling system
    being specified in ISO&#x2F;IEC 15018 (Information technology - Integrated cabling
    for residential and SOHO (Small Office, Home Office) environments -- under development).
