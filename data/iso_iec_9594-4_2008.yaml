abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594-4:2008 specifies the behaviour of DSAs taking part in
    the distributed Directory application. The allowed behaviour has been designed
    so as to ensure a consistent service given a wide distribution of the DIB across
    many DSAs.</p><p>The Directory is not intended to be a general purpose database
    system, although it may be built on such systems. It is assumed that there is
    a considerably higher frequency of queries than of updates.</p>"
