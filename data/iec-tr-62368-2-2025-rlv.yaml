  content: "IEC TR 62368-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 62368-2:2025
    identifies the purpose and applicability of IEC 62368-1:2023 and the exclusions
    from the scope. The scope excludes requirements for functional safety. Functional
    safety is addressed in IEC 61508-1. Because the scope includes computers that
    can control safety systems, functional safety requirements would necessarily include
    requirements for computer processes and software. The requirements provided in
    IEC 60950-23 can be modified and added to IEC 62368 as another -X document. However,
    because of the hazard-based nature of IEC 62368-1, the requirements from IEC 60950-23
    have been incorporated into the body of IEC 62368-1 and made more generic. The
    intent of the addition of the IEC 60950-23 requirements is to maintain the overall
    intent of the technical requirements from IEC 60950-23, incorporate them into
    IEC 62368-1 following the overall format of IEC 62368-1 and simplify and facilitate
    the application of these requirements. Robots traditionally are covered under
    the scopes of ISO documents, typically maintained by ISO TC 299. ISO TC 299 has
    working groups for personal care robots and service robots, and produces for example,
    ISO 13482, Robots and robotic devices - Safety requirements for personal care
    robots. In this document, only those subclauses from IEC 62368-1 considered to
    need further background reference information or explanation to benefit the user
    in applying the relevant requirements are included. Therefore, not all numbered
    subclauses are cited. Unless otherwise noted, all references are to clauses, subclauses,
    annexes, figures or tables located in IEC 62368‑1:2023. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) It takes into account changes
    made in the fourth edition of IEC 62368-1 (IEC 62368-1:2023) as identified in
    the Foreword of IEC 62368 1:2023"
