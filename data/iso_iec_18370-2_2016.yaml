abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18370-2:2016 specifies blind digital signature mechanisms, together
    with mechanisms for three variants of blind digital signatures. The variants are
    blind digital signature mechanisms with partial disclosure, blind digital signature
    mechanisms with selective disclosure and traceable blind digital signature mechanisms.
    The security of all the mechanisms in ISO/IEC 18370-2:2016 is based on the discrete
    logarithm problem.<p>For each mechanism, ISO/IEC 18370-2:2016 specifies the following:</p><p>-
    the process for generating the keys of the entities involved in these mechanisms;</p><p>-
    the process for producing blind signatures;</p><p>- the process for verifying
    signatures.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18370-2:2016 specifies another process specific to blind
    signature mechanisms with selective disclosure, namely, the following:</p><p>-
    the presentation process.</p><p>Furthermore, ISO/IEC 18370-2:2016 specifies other
    processes specific to traceable blind signature mechanisms, namely, the following:</p><p>a)
    the process for tracing requestors;</p><p>b) the process for tracing signatures;</p><p>c)
    the requestor tracing evidence evaluation process (optional);</p><p>d) the signature
    tracing evidence evaluation process (optional).</p>
