    them with determining and recording verification of conformity of the equipment
    under test with the requirements of IEC61010-2-043 (1997). If the paper version
    of the report is ordered, a diskette is provided with fill-in tables for recording
    the test results. If the report is downloaded directly from the web, it consists
    of two files: the technical report as a ZIP file and the fill-in tables as a revisable
    file.'
