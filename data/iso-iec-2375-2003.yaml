    <p>ISO/IEC 2375:2003 specifies the procedures to be followed for preparing, maintaining, and publishing a register of escape sequences and of the coded character sets they identify.</p>
    <p>The registration process specified in ISO/IEC 2375:2003 is <i>not </i>a procedure for standardization of characters or coded character sets. Organizations that wish ISO and/or IEC to create an international standard for a coded character set or that wish ISO and/or IEC to code additional characters into ISO/IEC 10646 need to follow the ISO/IEC procedures for doing so.</p>
    <p>In particular,</p>
    <ul><li>Registration of a coded character set according to the procedures specified by ISO/IEC 2375:2003 implies no commitment by ISO and/or IEC to adopt the coded character set as an ISO/IEC standard.</li><li>The existence of a character in an approved registration does not imply a commitment by ISO and/or IEC to encode that character into ISO/IEC 10646.</li></ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 2022 describes the escape sequences referenced in ISO/IEC 2375:2003, except for escape sequences reserved in ISO/IEC 2022 for private use.</p>
    <p>The use of these escape sequences includes code extension, that is, the provision of additional sets of characters, or of additional control functions, in accordance with ISO/IEC 2022.</p>
    <p>An escape sequence registered in accordance with ISO/IEC 2375:2003 serves as an identification of the character, the set of characters, or the control function associated with it in the register.</p>
    <p>The registration itself does not specify the rules in accordance with which a character or character set identified by an escape sequence is to be used. Rather, the registration identifies the documents (for example, standards) which specify such rules.</p>
