  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />This standard specifies Customer Premises
    Cabling for the connection of customer premises equipment with 1,544 Mbit&#x2F;s
    and 2,048 Mbit&#x2F;s interfaces to ISDN primary access and leased lines. The
    requirements in this standard are derived from ITU-T I.431 (Blue Book, Volume
    III) and contain additional requirements as well as modifications of ITU-T I.431
    and IEC 60603-7. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14709 is intended for use by those
    designing, planning, procuring, installing or testing cabling for ISDN primary
    access within a customer&#x27;s premises. The design requirements are specified
    in clause 5; the minimum requirements for the associated components are specified
    in clause 7. In addition, guidance is given for the use of generic cabling in
    accordance with ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801.
