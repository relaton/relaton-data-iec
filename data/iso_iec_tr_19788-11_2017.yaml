abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19788-11:2017 provides guidance in the form of rules and heuristics
    for the development of a conversion script from an IEEE 1484.12.1-2002 (LOM) record
    to an MLR data element set.<br />\r\nNot all of LOM can be mapped to the MLR.
    As more parts are added to the ISO/IEC 19788 series, future version of this document
    is expected to provide a better coverage of the LOM metadata."
