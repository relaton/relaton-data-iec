  content: "IEC 61300-2-6:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-6:2023
    describes a test to ensure the coupling mechanism of a connector set or connector
    and device combination withstands the axial loads likely to be applied during
    normal service, and that the optical performance remains within the given specifications
    during this test. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) addition of normative references;<br />\r\nb) modification of the details
    to be specified;<br />\r\nc) addition of optical monitoring."
