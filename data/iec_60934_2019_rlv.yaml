    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60934:2019 is applicable
    to mechanical switching devices designed as \"circuitâ€‘breakers for equipment\"
    (CBE) for household and similar applications. CBEs according to this document
    are intended to provide protection to circuits within electrical equipment including
    its components (e.g. motors, transformers, internal wiring). This document covers
    also CBEs applicable for protection of electrical equipment in case of undervoltage
    and/or overvoltage. This document also covers CBEs which are suitable for isolation.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2000,
    Amendment 1:2007 and Amendment 2:2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
