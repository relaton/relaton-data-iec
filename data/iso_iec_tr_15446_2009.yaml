abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR15446:2009 provides guidance relating to the construction of
    Protection Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets (STs) that are intended to be compliant
    with the third edition of ISO/IEC 15408. It is also applicable to PPs and STs
    compliant with Common Criteria Version 3.1, a technically identical standard published
    by the Common Criteria Management Board, a consortium of governmental organizations
    involved in IT security evaluation and certification. ISO/IEC TR15446:2009 is
    not intended as an introduction to evaluation using ISO/IEC 15408. Readers who
    seek such an introduction should consult ISO/IEC 15408-1. ISO/IEC TR15446:2009
    does not deal with associated tasks beyond PP and ST specifications such as PP
    registration and the handling of protected intellectual property.
