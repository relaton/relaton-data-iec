  content: "IEC TS 62898-3-1:2020(E) provides guidelines for the specification of
    fault protection and dynamic control in microgrids. Protection and dynamic control
    in a microgrid are intended to ensure safe and stable operation of the microgrid
    under fault and disturbance conditions.<br />\r\nThis document applies to AC microgrids
    comprising single or three-phase networks or both. It includes both isolated microgrids
    and non-isolated microgrids with a single point of connection (POC) to the upstream
    distribution network. It does not apply to microgrids with two or more points
    of connection to the upstream distribution network, although such systems can
    follow the guidelines given in this document. This document applies to microgrids
    operating at LV or MV or both. DC and hybrid AC/DC microgrids are excluded from
    the scope, due to the particular characteristics of DC systems (extremely large
    fault currents and the absence of naturally occurring current zero crossings).<br
    />\r\nThis document defines the principles of protection and dynamic control for
    microgrids, general technical requirements, and specific technical requirements
    of fault protection and dynamic control. It addresses new challenges in microgrid
    protection requirements, transient disturbance control and dynamic disturbance
    control requirements for microgrids. It focuses on the differences between conventional
    power system protection and new possible solutions for microgrid protection functions.<br
    />\r\nDepending on specific situations, additional or stricter requirements can
    be defined by the microgrid operator in coordination with the distribution system
    operator (DSO).<br />\r\nThis document does not cover protection and dynamic control
    of active distribution systems. This document does not cover product requirements
    for measuring relays and protection equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    cover safety aspects in low voltage electrical installations, which are covered
    by IEC 60364 (all parts and amendments related to low-voltage electrical installations).
    Requirements relating to low voltage microgrids can be found in IEC 60364-8-2."
