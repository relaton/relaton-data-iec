    <p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2012 provides information about the Microsoft® Windows® Automation Frameworks, including Microsoft Active Accessibility, User Interface (UI) Automation, and the common interfaces of these accessibility frameworks including the IAccessibleEx interface specification. It provides information on application programming interfaces (APIs) needed to use these frameworks.</p>
    <p>A primary goal of ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2012 is to ensure that accessible software applications can be written in such a way that they are fully compatible with the Microsoft Accessibility APIs available on the Microsoft Windows operating system.</p>
