abstract:
- content: IEC 62951-3:2018(E) specifies the method for evaluating thin film transistor
    characteristics on flexible substrates under bulging. The thin film transistor
    is fabricated on flexible substrates, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
    polyimide (PI), elastomer and others. The stress is applied by applying a uniformly-distributed
    pressure to the flexible substrate using the equipment.
