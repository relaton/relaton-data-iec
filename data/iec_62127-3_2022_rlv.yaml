abstract:
- content: "IEC 62127-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62127-3:2022
    specifies relevant hydrophone characteristics. This document is applicable to:<br
    />\r\n- hydrophones employing piezoelectric sensor elements, designed to measure
    the pulsed and continuous wave ultrasonic fields generated by ultrasonic equipment;<br
    />\r\n- hydrophones used for measurements made in water;<br />\r\n- hydrophones
    with or without an associated pre-amplifier.<br />\r\nIEC 62127-3:2022 cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2007 and Amendment 1:2013. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) The upper
    frequency limit of 40 MHz has been removed.<br />\r\nb) Hydrophone sensitivity
    definitions have been changed to recognize sensitivities as complex-valued quantities.<br
    />\r\nc) Procedures to determine the effective hydrophone size have been changed
    according to the rationale outlined in Annex B.<br />\r\nd) Requirements on the
    frequencies for which the effective hydrophone size shall be provided have been
    changed to achieve practicality for increased frequency bands.<br />\r\ne) The
    new Annex B and Annex C have been added.<br />\r\nf) Annex A has been updated
    to reflect the changes of the normative parts."
