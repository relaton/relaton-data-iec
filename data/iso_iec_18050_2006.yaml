abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18050:2006 specifies two methodologies for the measurement
    of specific print quality attributes of two-dimensional bar code symbols printed
    within the requirements of Digital Postage Marks. One of these methodologies is
    applicable to multi-row bar code symbologies and the other to two-dimensional
    matrix symbologies. ISO/IEC 18050:2006 defines methods for grading print quality
    attributes and deriving an overall assessment of symbol quality. In addition,
    it gives information on possible causes of deviation from optimum grades so as
    to assist users and postal operators in taking appropriate corrective action.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    18050:2006 applies only to those two-dimensional symbologies for which a reference
    decode algorithm has been defined, and provides an indicative read rate for limiting
    mean parameter values. The methodologies can be applied partially or wholly to
    other similar symbologies.</p>"
