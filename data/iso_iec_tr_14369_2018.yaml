abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 14369:2018 provides guidelines to those concerned with developing
    specifications of information technology services and their interfaces intended
    for use by clients of the services, in particular by external applications that
    do not necessarily all share the environment and assumptions of one particular
    programming language. The guidelines do not directly or fully cover all aspects
    of service or interface specifications, but they do cover those aspects required
    to achieve language independence, i.e. required to make a specification neutral
    with respect to the language environment from which the service is invoked. The
    guidelines are primarily concerned with the interface between the service and
    the external applications making use of the service, including the special case
    where the service itself is already specified in a language-dependent way but
    needs to be invoked from environments of other languages. Language bindings, already
    addressed by ISO/IEC TR 10182, are dealt with by providing advice on how to use
    the two documents together.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 14369:2018 provides technical guidelines,
    rather than organizational or administrative guidelines for the management of
    the development process, though in some cases the technical guidelines can have
    organizational or administrative implications.</p>"
