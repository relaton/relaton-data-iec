  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-10:2005 was developed jointly with the ITU-T in response
    to the growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications
    such as digital storage media, television broadcasting, Internet streaming and
    real-time audiovisual communication. It is also designed to enable the use of
    the coded video representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network
    environments. It is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide
    range of applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services. The use
    of ISO/IEC 14496-10:2005 allows motion video to be manipulated as a form of computer
    data and to be stored on various storage media, transmitted and received over
    existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future broadcasting
    channels. In the course of creating ISO/IEC 14496-10:2005, requirements from a
    wide variety of applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements
    have been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence,
    ISO/IEC 14496-10:2005 will facilitate video data interchange among different applications.</p>"
