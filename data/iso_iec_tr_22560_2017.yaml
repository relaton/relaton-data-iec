abstract:
- content: This Technical Report describes the concepts, issues, objectives, and requirements
    for the design of an active air-flow control (AFC) system for commercial aircraft
    based on a dense deployment of wired and wireless sensor and actuator networks.
    It focuses on the architecture design, module definition, statement of objectives,
    scalability analysis, system-level simulation, as well as networking and implementation
    issues using standardized interfaces and service-oriented middleware architectures.
