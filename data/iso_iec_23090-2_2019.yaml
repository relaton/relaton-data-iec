abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23090-2:2019 This document specifies the omnidirectional media
    format for coding, storage, delivery, and rendering of omnidirectional media,
    including video, images, audio, and timed text.<br />\r\nIn an OMAF player the
    user's viewing perspective is from the centre of the sphere looking outward towards
    the inside surface of the sphere.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 In this document, only 3 degrees
    of freedom (3DOF) is supported. In other words, purely translational movement
    of the user does not result in different omnidirectional media being rendered
    to the user. For 3DOF support with stereoscopic video, when the user rolls his/her
    head, there could be a stereoscopic rendering issue.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Omnidirectional
    video could contain graphics elements generated by computer graphics but encoded
    as video."
