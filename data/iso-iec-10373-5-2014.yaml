    <p>ISO/IEC 10373-5:2014 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification cards applications.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1       Criteria for acceptability do not form part of this International Standard but will be found in the International Standards mentioned above.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2       Test methods described in this International Standard are intended to be performed separately. A given card is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10373 deals with test methods which are specific to optical memory card technology. ISO/IEC 10373‑1 deals with test methods which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts deal with other technology-specific tests.</p>
