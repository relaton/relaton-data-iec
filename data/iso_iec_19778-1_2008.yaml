abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19778 is applicable to collaborative technologies used to support
    communication among learners, instructors and other participants. The implementation
    and communicative use of these technologies entails the creation of information
    related to participant groups, and to the collaborative environments, functions
    and tools that are set up for, and used by, these groups. ISO/IEC 19778-1:2008
    - together with its subsequent parts - defines data models that enable the portability
    and reuse of this data in integrated form, and allow Data Model instantiations
    to be interchanged, stored, retrieved, reused or analysed by a variety of systems.
    ISO/IEC 19778-1:2008 specifies a table-based approach for defining Data Models.
    This Data Model specification is used for specifying the collaborative workplace
    Data Model. The same Data Model specification is also used in ISO/IEC 19778-2
    and ISO/IEC 19778-3 to define the related components of the collaborative environment
    (ISO/IEC 19778-2) and the collaborative group (ISO/IEC 19778-3) in separate Data
    Models.
