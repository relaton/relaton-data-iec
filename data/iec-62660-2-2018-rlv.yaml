  content: "IEC 62660-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62660-2:2018
    specifies test procedures to observe the reliability and abuse behaviour of secondary
    lithium-ion cells and cell blocks used for propulsion of electric vehicles including
    battery electric vehicles (BEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). This document
    specifies the standard test procedures and conditions for basic characteristics
    of lithium-ion cells for use in propulsion of battery and hybrid electric vehicles.
    The tests are indispensable for obtaining essential data on reliability and abuse
    behaviour of lithium-ion cells for use in various designs of battery systems and
    battery packs. This document provides standard classification of description of
    test results to be used for the design of battery systems or battery packs. IEC
    62660-2:2018 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The procedure
    of forced discharge test has been clarified (6.4.3.2).<br />\r\nb) \"Cell block\"
    has been added to the scope (Clause 1).<br />\r\nc) Option of temperature cycling
    test with electrical operation has been deleted (6.3.2).<br />\r\nd) The test
    conditions for overcharge test have been revised (6.4.2.2)."
