abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62607-2-5:2022 specifies the protocols for determining the mass
    density of vertically-aligned carbon nanotubes (VACNTs) by X-ray absorption method.
    This document outlines experimental procedures, data formats, and some case studies.
    These protocols are applicable to VACNT films with thickness larger than several
    tens of micrometres. There are no limitations in materials for substrate.
