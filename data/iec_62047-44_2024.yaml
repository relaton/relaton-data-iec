abstract:
- content: IEC 62047-44:2024 describes terminology, definitions and test methods that
    are used to evaluate and determine the dynamic performance of MEMS (Micro-Electromechanical
    Systems) resonant electric‑field‑sensitive devices. It also specifies sample requirements
    and test equipment for dynamic performances of MEMS resonant electric‑field‑sensitive
    devices. The statements made in this document are also applicable to MEMS resonant
    electric‑field‑sensitive devices with various driving mechanisms such as electrostatic,
    electrothermal, electromagnetic, piezoelectric, etc.
