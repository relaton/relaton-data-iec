  content: IEC TR 63571:2025 describes a method to calculate “SYSTEM”-level lifetime
    from “PART”-level lifetime. It presents a general mathematical theory and simple
    calculation examples for educational purposes. Of the elements related to “SYSTEM”-level
    lifetime, software-related elements such as diagnostics are outside the scope
    of this document.
