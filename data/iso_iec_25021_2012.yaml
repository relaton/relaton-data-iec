abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 25021:2012 provides guides to specify Quality Measure Elements
    (QME) and initial set of QME as examples. QME is a measure defined in terms of
    a property and the measurement method for quantifying it, including optionally
    the transformation by a mathematical function.   ISO/IEC 25021:2012 is intended
    to be used throughout the system and software product life cycle used with other
    documents of the ISO/IEC 250nn SQuaRE series, especially ISO/IEC 25022, ISO/IEC
    25023 and ISO/IEC 25024.
