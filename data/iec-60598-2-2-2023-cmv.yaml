  content: "IEC 60598-2-2:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60598-2-2:2023 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60598-2-2:2011
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 34D experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60598-2-2:2023 specifies requirements for recessed luminaires
    incorporating electric light sources for operation from supply voltages up to
    1 000 V. It also specifies requirements for recessed air-handling luminaires for
    use with a ventilation duct or ventilated space (plenum).<br />\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2011. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition (there are
    no major technical changes, see Annex D):\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">The requirements specific to recessed luminaries
    given in IEC 60598-1 are now incorporated in this Part 2-2.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">The
    requirements for air-handling luminaires given in IEC 60598-2-19 are now incorporated
    in this Part 2-2.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">The references to
    Part 1 have been updated.</li>\r\n</ol>"
