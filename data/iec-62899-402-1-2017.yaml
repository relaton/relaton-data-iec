  content: IEC 62899-402-1:2017(E) specifies the measurement methods of the widths
    of the printed patterns in printed electronics. These printed pattern widths are
    treated as two-dimensional on a substrate. When the patterns are definitely affected
    by three-dimensional configurations, these are specified in measurement methods
    for thickness in printed electronics.
