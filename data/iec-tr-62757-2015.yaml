  content: IEC TR 62757:2015(E), which is a technical report, deals with fire prevention
    measures on converters and their valve halls for high voltage direct current (HVDC)
    systems, static VAR compensators (SVC) and flexible AC transmission systems (FACTS).
    It is intended to be primarily for the use of the utilities and consultants who
    are responsible for issuing technical specifications for new converter valves
    and valve halls. It concerns fire incidents in HVDC projects using line commutated
    converters (LCC) or voltage sourced converter (VSC) technology and it is from
    these projects that most examples of fires and fire incidents are taken. This
    technical report also addresses converter valves and valve halls for SVC and FACTS.
    This technical report provides general recommendations to be considered while
    preparing specifications for these systems. Specific requirements for a particular
    project need to be clearly specified and mutually agreed upon between the supplier
    and the purchaser.
