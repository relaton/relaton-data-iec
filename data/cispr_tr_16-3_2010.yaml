abstract:
- content: CISPR/TR 16-3:2010(E) is a collection of technical reports that serve as
    background and supporting information for the various other standards and technical
    reports in CISPR 16 series. In addition, background information is provided on
    the history of CISPR, as well as a historical reference on the measurement of
    interference power from household and similar appliances in the VHF range. Over
    the years, CISPR prepared a number of recommendations and reports that have significant
    technical merit but were not generally available. Reports and recommendations
    were for some time published in CISPR 7 and CISPR 8. At its meeting in Campinas,
    Brazil, in 1988, CISPR subcommittee A agreed on the table of contents of Part
    3, and to publish the reports for posterity by giving the reports a permanent
    place in Part 3. With the reorganization of CISPR 16 in 2003, the significance
    of CISPR limits material was moved to CISPR 16-4-3, whereas recommendations on
    statistics of disturbance complaints and on the report on the determination of
    limits were moved to CISPR 16 4-4. The contents of Amendment 1 (2002) of CISPR
    16-3 were moved to CISPR 16-4-1. This third edition of CISPR 16-3 cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2003, and its Amendments 1 (2005) and
    2 (2006). It is a technical revision. The main technical change with respect to
    the previous edition consist of the addition of a new clause to provide background
    information on FFT instrumentation.
