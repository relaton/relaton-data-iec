  content: "IEC SRD 62913-1:2022 (E) describes a common approach for IEC technical
    committees to define generic smart grid requirements for further standardization
    work. It uses as input the use case methodology defined as part of the IEC 62559
    series, and provides a more detailed methodology for describing use cases and
    extracting requirements from these use cases. This will achieve a consistent and
    homogeneous description of generic requirements for the different areas which
    make up the smart grid environment<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n• it consolidates requirements identification
    and management and their associated naming rules;<br />\r\n• it leverages IEC
    SRD 63200:2021, Definition of extended SGAM Smart Energy Grid Reference Architecture
    Model;<br />\r\n• it highlights links between use case methodology and other tools
    and methodologies (i.e. TOGAF/ArchiMate as used in IEC 61968-1:2020)."
