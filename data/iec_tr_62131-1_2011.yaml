abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62131-1:2011(E) reviews the essentially empirical data validation
    procedure adopted to establish confidence in the data utilized by the other Parts
    of IEC/TR 62131. The adoption of a validation procedure was necessary, due the
    lack of fully validated data sets. This technical report is intended to be generic
    in nature and is normally expected to be adopted as far as is practical within
    the circumstances of any particular data item.
