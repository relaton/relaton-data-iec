  content: "IEC TR 61292-6:2023 which is a Technical Report, relates to distributed
    Raman amplification (DRA). Its main purpose is to provide background material
    for future standards related to DRA, such as specifications, test methods and
    operating procedures. This document covers the following aspects:<br />\r\n- general
    overview of Raman amplification;<br />\r\n- applications of DRA;<br />\r\n- performance
    characteristics and test methods related to DRA;<br />\r\n- operational issues
    relating to the deployment of DRA.<br />\r\nAs DRA is a relatively new technology,
    and still rapidly evolving, some of the material in this document can become obsolete
    or irrelevant in a fairly short period of time. This document will be updated
    frequently to minimize this possibility. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- correction of the formula for noise figure;<br
    />\r\n- correction of errors in Figure 10."
