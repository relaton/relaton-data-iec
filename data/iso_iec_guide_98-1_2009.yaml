abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC Guide 98-1:2009(E) provides a brief introduction to the "Guide
    to the expression of uncertainty in measurement" (GUM) in order to indicate the
    relevance of that fundamental guide and promote its use. It also outlines documents
    related to the GUM that are intended to extend the application of that guide to
    broader categories and fields of practical problems. ISO/IEC Guide 98-1:2009(E)
    addresses measurement science at a level that is suitable for those readers who
    have received training at least to the second year of a science- or engineering-based
    degree course containing some teaching of probability theory and statistics. It
    also considers various concepts used in measurement science. In particular, it
    covers the need to characterize the quality of a measurement through appropriate
    statements of measurement uncertainty. This introductory document also outlines
    the recent evolution of thinking regarding measurement uncertainty.
