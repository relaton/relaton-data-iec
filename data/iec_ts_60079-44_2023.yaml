abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60079-44:2023, which is a Technical Specification, is to provide
    guidance to establish recommended minimum criteria to determine roles, establish
    expectations of the necessary skills and evidence of competence to assess and
    manage the competence of personnel conducting work in or associated with hazardous
    areas. The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to establish:<br />\r\n•
    recommended minimum criteria to determine roles,<br />\r\n• expectations of the
    necessary skills, and<br />\r\n• evidence of competence<br />\r\nin order to assess
    and manage the competence of personnel who are conducting work in or associated
    with hazardous areas.<br />\r\nThis document provides examples and recommendations
    of minimum levels of competence for typical roles associated with hazardous areas
    by addressing the knowledge, skills, or abilities that is expected of personnel.
    Additionally, examples of the evidence of competence expected for each role are
    provided.<br />\r\nThe aim of tThis document is to assist in defining, assessing,
    and managing unique requirements for the competence of individuals working in
    or associated with installations where an explosive atmosphere could be present.
    Such a programme could be specific to a facility or used in conjunction with other
    regulatory requirements where they exist. The competencies for conducting work
    in a hazardous area are in addition to any competencies which may apply for the
    general type of work being undertaken (for example, professional credentials,
    electrical, non-electrical, operations, design).<br />\r\nThis document applies
    to both electrical and non-electrical applications.<br />\r\nThis document identifies
    the minimum level of knowledge and skills required to work in hazardous areas
    and the specific competence required for work associated with equipment for explosive
    atmospheres (commonly termed ‘Ex Equipment’) and the standards to which competence
    is to be assessed and attributed.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this document is to
    provide guidance to establish:<br />\r\n• recommended minimum criteria to determine
    roles,<br />\r\n• expectations of the necessary skills, and<br />\r\n• evidence
    of competence<br />\r\nThe principal application of this specification document
    is for personnel dealing with explosion-protected and associated equipment for
    use in explosive atmospheres, including the following work functions:<br />\r\n•
    Classification of areas;<br />\r\n• Producing, processing or servicing functions
    in a hazardous area and not directly involved in installing, maintaining or repairing
    explosion-protected equipment and systems;<br />\r\n• Designing, commissioning
    and maintaining explosion-protection strategies and equipment;<br />\r\n• Selecting,
    installing, testing and maintaining explosion-protected equipment and systems
    in hazardous areas;<br />\r\n• Inspecting hazardous area equipment, systems and
    installations;<br />\r\n• Overhauling, repairing and modifying explosion-protected
    equipment;<br />\r\n• Management of the Ex aspects of the facility."
