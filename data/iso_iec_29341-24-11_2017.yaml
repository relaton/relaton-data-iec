abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-24-11:2017 specifies the characteristics of the UPnP networked service named
    WANIPv6FirewallControl, version 1. This service definition is compliant with UPnP
    Service Architecture 1.0 [1].<br />\r\nThis service supports the management IPv6
    firewall pinholes in Internet gateway devices independent of the WAN access type
    (PPP, DHCP,?). It also supports access control to restrict operations to authorized
    control points and users. It enables UPnP control points to:<br />\r\n- create
    and delete pinholes of limited duration that allow external communication from
    the WAN side of the gateway to reach devices on the LAN side<br />\r\n- determine
    operational status of a pinhole<br />\r\nThis service does not support:<br />\r\n-
    retrieving detailed information about pinholes (such as associated external port
    or remaining lease duration)<br />\r\n- outbound packet filtering<br />\r\n- modification
    of security policies of a gateway device"
