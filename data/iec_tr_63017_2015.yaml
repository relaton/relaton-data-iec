abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63017:2015(E) specifies a compensation method of Cu linewidth according
    to impeadance reduction by using noise suppression materials (hereafter referred
    to as NSMs) for FPCBs. This Technical Report presents an optimum result for maintaining
    a designated performance of FPCBs by using NSMs. It also indicates a measuring
    method for an impedance variation of FPCBs using NSMs with the prevailing TDR
    (time domain reflectometry) method. This method is resticted to measuring only
    the variation of an impedance value in accordance with the variation of the Cu
    linewidth by using NSMs for FPCBs. This report, however, neither determines nor
    indicates the structure or material of FPCBs.
