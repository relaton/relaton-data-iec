  content: "ISO/IEC 10192-4-2:2024 specifies a control architecture, user interface,
    and service objects in the HES gateway to enable interworking among home cluster
    systems and interoperability among the applications supported by these cluster
    systems. The ISO/IEC 10192 series specifies a common user interface to these cluster-system
    applications. This common user interface provides input and output methods for
    user information exchange to access, monitor, control and coordinate applications
    running on home cluster systems.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the application
    object, service and interface modules from the interoperability standard (ISO/IEC
    18012 series) necessary for interworking and incorporation of these modules in
    the HES gateway (ISO/IEC 15045 series)."
