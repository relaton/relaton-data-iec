abstract:
- content: "IEC 628621-6:2024 specifies the technical requirements (safety and physical
    parameters), test methods, inspection rules and intervals, sampling, judgment,
    marking, labelling and accompanying documents, packaging, transportation and storage,
    recycling and disposal of silicone-based heat transfer fluids (SiHTF) for use
    in line-focusing solar thermal power plants.<br />\r\nThe application of polydimethylsiloxane-based
    heat transfer fluids for this type of installation is covered in this document.
    Owing to their chemical nature and composition, the introduction of new test methods
    to determine the applicability and the thermal stability of SiHTF is included
    in this document."
