abstract:
- content: "IEC 60691:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60691:2023
    is applicable to thermal-links intended for incorporation in electrical appliances,
    electronic equipment and component parts thereof, normally intended for use indoors,
    in order to protect them against excessive temperatures under abnormal conditions.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 The equipment is not designed to generate heat.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The
    effectiveness of the protection against excessive temperatures logically depends
    upon the position and method of mounting of the thermal-link, as well as upon
    the current which it is carrying.<br />\r\nThis document may be applicable to
    thermal-links for use under conditions other than indoors, provided that the climatic
    and other circumstances in the immediate surroundings of such thermal-links are
    comparable with those in this standard.<br />\r\nThis document may be applicable
    to thermal-links in their simplest forms (e.g. melting strips or wires), provided
    that molten materials expelled during function cannot adversely interfere with
    the safe use of the equipment, especially in the case of hand-held or portable
    equipment, irrespective of its position."
