  script: Latn
  content: "IEC TS 60318-7:2017(E) describes a head and torso simulator, or manikin,
    intended for the measurement of air-conduction hearing aids in the frequency range
    from 100 Hz to 16 000 Hz.<br />\r\nThe manikin described in this document is intended
    for airborne acoustic measurements only. It is not suitable for measurements which
    depend upon vibration transmission paths such as bone conduction, or for measurements
    requiring the simulation of bone or tissue.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the
    manikin in terms of both its geometrical dimensions and its acoustical properties.
    Only manikins compliant with both sets of specifications are in conformance with
    this document.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the document is based
    on the designs of three different commonly used types of manikins;<br />\r\nb)
    the cross sections of the head and torso and pinna simulators of the previous
    edition are replaced by maximum and minimum values of their geometric dimensions;<br
    />\r\nc) the diffuse field frequency response of the manikin is added;<br />\r\nd)
    the usable frequency range is extended to 100 Hz to 16 000 Hz;<br />\r\ne) in
    addition to the cylindrical ear canal extension a tapered ear canal extension
    is added;<br />\r\nf) design examples of one anatomically shaped manikin and of
    two different geometrically shaped manikins are given in the annexes;<br />\r\ng)
    the relationship between tolerance interval, corresponding acceptance interval
    and the maximum permitted uncertainty of measurement are given in an annex;<br
    />\r\nh) 3D representations of three different types of pinna simulators are given
    in an annex."
