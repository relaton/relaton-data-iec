abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21838-2:2021 This document describes Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), which is an
    ontology that is conformant to the requirements specified for top-level ontologies
    in ISO/IEC 21838‑1.<br />\r\nIt describes BFO as a resource designed to support
    the interchange of information among heterogeneous information systems. The following
    are within the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- definitions of BFO-2020 terms
    and relations;<br />\r\n- axiomatizations of BFO-2020 in OWL 2 and CL;<br />\r\n-
    documentation of the conformity of BFO-2020 to the requirements specified for
    top-level ontologies in ISO/IEC 21838‑1;<br />\r\n- specification of the requirements
    for a domain ontology if it is to serve as a module in a suite of ontologies in
    which BFO serves as top-level ontology hub by providing a starting point for the
    introduction of the most general terms in those domain ontologies which are its
    nearest neighbours within the suite;<br />\r\n- specification of the role played
    by the terms in BFO in the formulation of definitions and axioms in ontologies
    at lower levels that conform to BFO.<br />\r\nThe following are outside the scope
    of this document:<br />\r\n- specification of ontology languages, including the
    languages RDF, OWL, and CL standardly used in ontology development;<br />\r\n-
    specification of methods for reasoning with ontologies;<br />\r\n- specification
    of translators between the notations of ontologies developed in different ontology
    languages."
