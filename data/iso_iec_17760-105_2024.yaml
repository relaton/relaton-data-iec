abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 17760-105:2024 The set of AT Attachment standards consists of
    this standard and the ATA implementation standards described in AT Attachment
    - 8 ATA/ATAPI Architecture Model (ATA8-AAM). This standard specifies the command
    set that host systems use to access storage devices. This standard provides a
    common command set for systems manufacturers, system integrators, software suppliers,
    and suppliers of intelligent storage devices. Figure 1 shows the relationship
    of this standard to other ATA standards as well as related device and host standards
    and specifications (e.g., SCSI standards and SATA-IO specifications).<br />\r\nThis
    standard maintains compatibility with the ACS-4 standard, INCITS 529-2018, while
    providing additional functions."
