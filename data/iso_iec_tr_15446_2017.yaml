abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 15446 provides guidance relating to the construction of Protection
    Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets (STs) that are intended to be compliant with
    the third edition of ISO/IEC 15408 (all parts). It is also applicable to PPs and
    STs compliant with Common Criteria Version 3.1 Revision 4[6], a technically identical
    standard published by the Common Criteria Management Board, a consortium of governmental
    organizations involved in IT security evaluation and certification.<br />\r\nNOTE
    ISO/IEC TR 15446 is not intended as an introduction to evaluation using ISO/IEC
    15408 (all parts). Readers who seek such an introduction can read ISO/IEC 15408â€‘1.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TR 15446 does not deal with associated tasks beyond PP and ST specification
    such as PP registration and the handling of protected intellectual property."
