    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 20000–1:2018 and two commonly used frameworks, Agile and DevOps. It can be used by any organization or person wishing to understand how Agile and DevOps can be used with ISO/IEC 20000–1, including:</span></p>

    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Both approaches can be used independently or together. Depending on the context, an organization can deploy Agile frameworks only, DevOps frameworks only, use both Agile and DevOps frameworks in isolation, or use an integrated workflow with combined Agile and DevOps approaches. In any of these situations, this document can be used as guidance for the integration of Agile and DevOps practices in an SMS.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The guidance in this document can assist an organization in planning and preparing for a conformity assessment against ISO/IEC 20000-1, noting that an organization can only claim conformity by fulfilling all requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1.</span></p>
