  content: IEC 62807-3-10:2023 is a family specification for FTTA (Fibre-To-The-Antenna)
    outdoor hybrid communication cables. It specifies the design and construction,
    rated values and characteristics, requirements and test methods, packaging and
    quality assurance, etc. The FTTA hybrid communication cables are typically but
    not only installed between the Base Band Unit (BBU) and Remote Radio Unit (RRU;
    or often called RRH – Remote Radio Head or AAU – Active Antenna Unit), and other
    scenario that supply electric current to optical communication equipment.
