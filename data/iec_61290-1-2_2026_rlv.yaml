abstract:
- content: "IEC 61290-1-2:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61290-1-2:2026
    applies to all commercially available optical amplifiers (OAs) and optically amplified
    sub-systems. It applies to OAs using optically pumped fibres (OFAs based on either
    rare-earth doped fibres or on the Raman effect), semiconductors (SOAs), and planar
    optical waveguides (POWAs). This document does not apply to polarization-maintaining
    optical amplifiers. This document defines uniform requirements for accurate and
    reliable measurements, by means of the electrical spectrum analyzer test method,
    of the following OA parameters, as defined in IEC 61291-1, Clause 3:<br />\r\na)
    nominal output signal power;<br />\r\nb) gain;<br />\r\nc) reverse gain;<br />\r\nd)
    maximum gain;<br />\r\ne) polarization-dependent gain.<br />\r\nIn addition, this
    test method provides a means for measuring the following parameters:<br />\r\n-
    maximum gain wavelength;<br />\r\n- gain wavelength band.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifically covers single-channel amplifiers. For multichannel amplifiers, the
    IEC 61290-10 series applies.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The applicability of the test methods
    described in this document to distributed Raman amplifiers is for further study.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 A test method for polarization-maintaining optical amplifiers is
    for further study.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of information on the applicability of
    this document to the scope;<br />\r\nb) harmonization of the scope with the IEC
    61290-1 series;<br />\r\nc) addition of safety recommendations to Clause 4 and
    Clause 5;<br />\r\nd) correction of an error in Clause 7, item e);<br />\r\ne)
    replacement of the term \"wavelength measurement accuracy\" with \"wavelength
    accuracy\"."
