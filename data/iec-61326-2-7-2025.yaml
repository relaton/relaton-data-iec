  script: Latn
  content: "IEC 61326-2-7:2025 specifies the EMC test requirements for process automation
    equipment using at least one Ethernet APL (Ethernet ADVANCED PHYSICAL LAYER) compliant
    port according IEC TS 63444. The type of equipment covered by this document includes
    INFRASTRUCTURE DEVICES such as switches as well as measurement and control devices.
    This document provides requirements for the EMC test setups of the APL interface
    for devices intended for use in process control and process measurement.<br />\r\nThe
    other functions of the equipment remain covered by other parts of the IEC 61326
    series.<br />\r\nNOTE Ethernet-APL uses IEEE Std. 802.3 2022 Ethernet Physical
    Layer 10BASE-T1L, suitable to be used for full-duplex communication over a single
    balanced pair of conductors.<br />\r\nThe test levels are based on the intended
    environment as stated in the product’s specification or user documentation and
    selected appropriately from IEC 61326-1."
