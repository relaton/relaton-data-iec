abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 23001-1:2006 provides a standardized set of generic technologies
    for encoding XML documents. It addresses a broad spectrum of applications and
    requirements by providing generic methods for transmitting and compressing XML
    documents.    ISO/IEC 23001-1:2006 provides a specification which gives rules
    for the preparation of XML documents for efficient transport and storage, and
    enables the development of ISO/IEC 23001-1 terminals to receive, decode and assemble
    possibly partitioned and compressed XML documents.    The binary MPEG format for
    XML relies on schema knowledge between encoder and decoder in order to reach high
    compression efficiency, while providing fragmentation mechanisms for ensuring
    transmission and processing flexibility. ISO/IEC 23001-1:2006 also defines means
    to compile and transmit schema knowledge information to enable the decoding of
    compressed XML documents without a priori schema knowledge at the receiving terminal.    The
    binary MPEG format for XML is described in four main sections:     System Architecture  presents
    the architecture of an ISO/IEC 23001-1-compliant terminal and general characteristics
    of an ISO/IEC 23001-1 decoder, such as decoder behaviour.    Binary Format  specifies
    binary syntax and associated semantics of the structural elements. In particular,
    this section describes the structure of a binary access unit.   Binary Fragment
    Update Payload  specifies binary syntax and associated semantics of the payload
    content. In particular, this section describes the decoding process of complex
    Type content using finite state automaton decoders.    Advanced Optimized Decoders  describes
    the mechanisms for decoding simple types of an XML document using advanced optimised
    decoders.      The binary format for XML described in this specification can be
    used for encoding MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 descriptions, as specified in ISO/IEC 15938-1
    (MPEG-7 Systems) and 21000-16 (MPEG-21 Binary Format), respectively.'
