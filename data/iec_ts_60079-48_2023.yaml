abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-48:2023, which is a Technical Specification, provides guidance
    for an owner or operator for the use of portable or personal electronic equipment
    to be used in hazardous areas requiring Equipment Protection Level (EPL) Gb, Gc,
    Db, or Dc that are not otherwise commercially available with a certificate.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to:<br />\r\n• equipment that is electrically
    connected to fixed equipment or fixed wiring during use in the hazardous area,
    for example a lead light connected to the premises wiring system by a plug and
    socket,<br />\r\n• portable or personal equipment with a certificate for use in
    a hazardous area,<br />\r\n• transportable equipment,<br />\r\n• portable or personal
    equipment used in Group I applications,<br />\r\n• battery powered tools, such
    as drills and saws,<br />\r\n• portable or personal equipment used in areas requiring
    EPL Ga or Da equipment, or,<br />\r\n• medical devices.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not address other considerations involving the use of portable or personal
    electronic equipment for other aspects of safety, for example, creation of a distraction
    from important work tasks, radio frequency interference with measurement and control
    equipment, or medical issues.<br />\r\nThis document supplements the guidance
    in IEC 60079-14 regarding the use of personal or portable equipment without a
    certificate for use in hazardous areas."
