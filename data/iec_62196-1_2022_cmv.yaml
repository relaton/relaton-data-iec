    all the changes between IEC 62196-1:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 62196-1:2014
    edition 3.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 23H experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant change.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62196-1:2022 is applicable
    to EV plugs, EV socket-outlets, vehicle connectors, vehicle inlets, herein referred
    to as \"accessories\", and to cable assemblies for electric vehicles (EV) intended
    for use in conductive charging systems which incorporate control means, with a
    rated operating voltage not exceeding:<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">690
    V AC 50 Hz to 60 Hz, at a rated current not exceeding 250 A;</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">1
    500 V DC at a rated current not exceeding 800 A.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2014. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"><li
    style=\"text-align:left\">deletion of references to universal AC and DC interfaces;</li><li
    style=\"text-align:left\">additional requirements for contact materials and plating;</li><li
    style=\"text-align:left\">changes to the temperature rise test to include additional
    points of measurement;</li><li style=\"text-align:left\">additional tests for
    accessories to address thermal stresses and stability, mechanical wear and abuse,
    and exposure to contaminants;</li><li style=\"text-align:left\">relocation of
    information and requirements for DC charging to IEC 62196-3.</li></ol>"
