abstract:
- content: "IEC 61280-2-8:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61280-2-8:2021
    specifies two main methods for the determination of low BER values by making accelerated
    measurements. These include the variable decision threshold method (Clause 5)
    and the variable optical threshold method (Clause 6). In addition, a third method,
    the sinusoidal interference method, is described in Annex B. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- correction of errors
    in Formula (8) in 5.5.2 and in a related formula in 5.5.3;<br />\r\n- correction
    of errors in the references to clauses, subclauses, figures, procedures, and in
    the Bibliography;<br />\r\n- alignment of the terms and definitions in 3.1 with
    those in IEC 61281-1."
