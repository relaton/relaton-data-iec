    <p>The primary purpose of the multipart standard ISO/IEC 19763 is to specify a metamodel framework for interoperability.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19763-5:2015 specifies the metamodel that describes a facility to register administrative information and selected metadata about process models. The metamodel specified in ISO/IEC 19763‑5:2015 is intended to promote semantic discovery and reuse of process models within/across process model repositories. For this purpose, it provides selected metadata and common semantics of process models created with a specific process modelling language, including Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), UML (Unified Modelling Language) Activity Diagram and EPC (Event-driven Process Chain), etc. The metamodel can help discovery of the function and composition of a process, and promote reuse of its components at different levels of granularity.</p>
