  content: IEC TS 63209-2:2022 includes a menu of tests to use for evaluation of the
    long-term reliability of materials used as backsheets and encapsulants in PV modules.
    It is intended <span style="background-color:white">to provide information to
    supplement the baseline testing defined in IEC 61215 and IEC 61730, which are
    qualification tests with pass-fail criteria. </span>used for reliability analysis
    and is not intended to be used as a pass-fail test procedure. This document addresses
    polymeric materials in the crystalline silicon module laminates, specifically
    backsheets and encapsulants in Glass/Glass or Glass/Backsheet modules. The included
    environmental stress tests are intended to cause degradation that is most relevant
    to field experience, but these may not capture all failure modes which may be
    observed in various locations.
