  content: "IEC 62442-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 62442-2:2018
    defines a measurement method of the power losses of electromagnetic controlgear,
    the total input power and the standby power of electronic controlgear for high
    intensity discharged lamps (excluding fluorescent lamps). A calculation method
    of the efficiency of controlgear for high intensity discharged lamp(s) is also
    defined. It is assumed that the controlgear are designed for use on DC supplies
    up to 1 000 V and/or AC supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision and has been harmonized with IEC 62442-1 and
    IEC 62442-3.</p>"
