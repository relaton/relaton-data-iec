abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60493-3:2017(E) clarifies how a statistical analysis can be done
    with a small number of samples.\r\nThis document will be useful when the accelerated
    test method is difficult to carry out, for example in cases where the dimensions
    of test specimens (including test devices) are very large in scale or the cost
    of test specimens is high. Testing is facilitated by enabling users to reduce
    the number of test specimens."
