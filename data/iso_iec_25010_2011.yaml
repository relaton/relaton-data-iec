abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25010:2011 defines:</p><ol><li>A quality in use model composed
    of five characteristics (some of which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics)
    that relate to the outcome of interaction when a product is used in a particular
    context of use. This system model is applicable to the complete human-computer
    system, including both computer systems in use and software products in use.</li><li>A
    product quality model composed of eight characteristics (which are further subdivided
    into subcharacteristics) that relate to static properties of software and dynamic
    properties of the computer system. The model is applicable to both computer systems
    and software products.</li></ol><p>The characteristics defined by both models
    are relevant to all software products and computer systems. The characteristics
    and subcharacteristics provide consistent terminology for specifying, measuring
    and evaluating system and software product quality. They also provide a set of
    quality characteristics against which stated quality requirements can be compared
    for completeness.</p><p>Although the scope of the product quality model is intended
    to be software and computer systems, many of the characteristics are also relevant
    to wider systems and services.</p><p>ISO/IEC 25012 contains a model for data quality
    that is complementary to this model.</p><p>The scope of the models excludes purely
    functional properties, but it does include functional suitability.</p><p>The scope
    of application of the quality models includes supporting specification and evaluation
    of software and software-intensive computer systems from different perspectives
    by those associated with their acquisition, requirements, development, use, evaluation,
    support, maintenance, quality assurance and control, and audit. The models can,
    for example, be used by developers, acquirers, quality assurance and control staff
    and independent evaluators, particularly those responsible for specifying and
    evaluating software product quality. Activities during product development that
    can benefit from the use of the quality models include:</p><ul><li>identifying
    software and system requirements;</li><li>validating the comprehensiveness of
    a requirements definition;</li><li>identifying software and system design objectives;</li><li>identifying
    software and system testing objectives;</li><li>identifying quality control criteria
    as part of quality assurance;</li><li>identifying acceptance criteria for a software
    product and/or software-intensive computer system;</li><li>establishing measures
    of quality characteristics in support of these activities.</li></ul>"
