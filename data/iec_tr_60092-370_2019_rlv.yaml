abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60092-370:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 60092-370:2019
    gives guidance and lays down the basic recommendations for the selection and installation
    of shipboard and offshore unit cables intended for electrical systems used in
    both essential and non-essential analogue or digital signal communication, transmission
    and control networks, including types suitable for high-frequency signals (i.e.
    signals with a frequency of more than 105 Hz). These cables are not suitable for
    direct connection to low impedance supplies. Where such cables are required, attention
    is drawn to IEC 60092-353. Cables intended to have limited circuit integrity (fire
    resistance) when affected by fire are not covered by this document. Fibre optical
    cables are not included. Sub-sea or umbilical cables are not included. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical change with respect to the previous edition: 30 V AC was added in voltage
    rating for data cables."
