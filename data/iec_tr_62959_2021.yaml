abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62959:2021 which is a Technical Report, provides information on
    cable shrinkage characterisation of optical fibre cables that consist of standard
    glass optical fibres for telecommunication application. The characterisation is
    directed to the effects of cable shrinkage or cable element shrinkage on the termination
    of cables. Shrinkage can or cannot be a concern depending on the method of termination.
    Examples of different cable termination cases are included and described. Tests
    for the evaluation of cable shrinkage are recommended that can be used as indicators,
    and shrinkage classification by several grades are given.
