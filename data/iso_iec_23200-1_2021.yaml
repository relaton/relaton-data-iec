abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a test method to evaluate the interference rejection
    performance of tags covered by ISO/IEC 18000-63 and a heterogeneous wireless system
    using different access technologies, e.g. radio frequency identification and cell
    phone network.</p><p>It specifies the general requirements and test requirements.</p><p>The
    test method in this document makes it possible to compare the relative interference
    rejection performance among tags under a single wireless interference environment.
    In addition, this document can be used in a benchmarking test according to requirements
    in a given application or service.</p>"
