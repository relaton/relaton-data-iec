    <p>ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 specifies</p>
    <ul>
    <li>rules for secure coding in the C programming language, and</li>
    <li>code examples.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 17961:2013 does not specify</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the mechanism by which these rules are enforced, or</li>
    <li>any particular coding style to be enforced.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Each rule in this Technical Specification is accompanied by code examples. Two distinct kinds of examples are provided:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><i>noncompliant examples</i> demonstrating language constructs that have weaknesses with potentially exploitable security implications; such examples are expected to elicit a diagnostic from a conforming analyzer for the affected language construct; and</li>
    <li><i>compliant examples</i> are expected not to elicit a diagnostic.</li>
    </ul>
