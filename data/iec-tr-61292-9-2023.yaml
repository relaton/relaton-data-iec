  content: "IEC TR 61292-9:2023 which is a Technical Report, describes the characteristic
    features of semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs), including the specific features
    of gain ripple and polarization dependent gain (PDG). This document focuses on
    amplifying applications of SOAs. Other applications, such as modulation, switching
    and non-linear functions, are not covered. Potential applications of SOAs, such
    as reflective SOAs (RSOAs) for the seeded wavelength division multiplexing passive
    optical network (WDM-PON), are reviewed in Annex A. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revised definitions for
    SOAs in 3.1;<br />\r\n- added more theoretical background on gain ripple measurements
    using amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) spectrum in 4.3;<br />\r\n- removed
    the formerly preferred set-up for output power and PDG measurements in Clause
    5."
