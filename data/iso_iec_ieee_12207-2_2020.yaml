- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document provides the mapping
    expressing corresponding relations between software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017 and the processes in ISO/IEC 12207:2008.</p><p>These relations are
    demonstrated by means of mapping tables that show relationships between activities
    and tasks, and process outcomes.</p><p>This mapping assists users of ISO/IEC 12207:2008
    to transition to using ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.</p><p>This document will help
    users understand the differences between the reference processes and requirements
    of the two editions of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and any potential gaps or process enhancements
    that can be needed in seeking conformance to and/or using ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.
    Also, this document provides to such users the mapping which helps to identify
    corresponding process outcomes, activities and tasks of processes for software
    systems in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.</p><p>The mapping between ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
    and ISO/IEC 12207:2008 in this document can be used as a basis to continuously
    conduct, improve and extend current process assets including software specific
    process assets based on ISO/IEC 12207:2008 for effective implementation of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017. These process activities and tasks can be applied iteratively.</p>
