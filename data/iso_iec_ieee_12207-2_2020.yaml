abstract:
- content: "This document provides the mapping expressing corresponding relations
    between software life cycle processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and the processes
    in ISO/IEC 12207:2008.<br />\r\nThese relations are demonstrated by means of mapping
    tables that show relationships between activities and tasks, and process outcomes.<br
    />\r\nThis mapping assists users of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 to transition to using
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.<br />\r\nThis document will help users understand the
    differences between the reference processes and requirements of the two editions
    of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and any potential gaps or process enhancements that can
    be needed in seeking conformance to and/or using ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. Also,
    this document provides to such users the mapping which helps to identify corresponding
    process outcomes, activities and tasks of processes for software systems in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207:2017.<br />\r\nThe mapping between ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008
    in this document can be used as a basis to continuously conduct, improve and extend
    current process assets including software specific process assets based on ISO/IEC
    12207:2008 for effective implementation of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. These process
    activities and tasks can be applied iteratively."
