    <p>The standard establishes a set of processes by which engineers and technologists can include consideration of ethical values throughout the stages of concept exploration and development, which encompass system initiation, analysis, and design. This standard provides engineers and technologists with an implementable process aligning innovation management processes, system design approaches, and software engineering methods to help address ethical concerns or risks during system design.</p>
    <p>IEEE Std 7000™ does not give specific guidance on the design of algorithms to apply ethical values such as fairness and privacy.</p>
