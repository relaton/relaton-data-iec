    defines the electromagnetic environment of the whole railway system including
    urban mass transit and light rail system. It describes the measurement method
    to verify the emissions, and gives the cartography values of the fields most frequently
    encountered. This document specifies the emission limits of the whole railway
    system to the outside world. This new edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: clarification of certain
    parts of the standard."
