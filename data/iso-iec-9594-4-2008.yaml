    <p>ISO/IEC 9594-4:2008 specifies the behaviour of DSAs taking part in the distributed Directory application. The allowed behaviour has been designed so as to ensure a consistent service given a wide distribution of the DIB across many DSAs.</p>
    <p>The Directory is not intended to be a general purpose database system, although it may be built on such systems. It is assumed that there is a considerably higher frequency of queries than of updates.</p>
