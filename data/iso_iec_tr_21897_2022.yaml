abstract:
- content: "<p>This document proposes elements for the expression of energy production,
    storage, reuse and consumption in reference to primary energy in data centres,
    taking into account both the elements needed for energy assessment and the concepts
    developed in the framework of the ISO 52000 series for energy performance of buildings
    (EPB).</p><p>This document:</p><p>— provides the main definitions and concepts
    from the ISO 52000 series needed to make a primary energy assessment for data
    centres;</p><p>— provides approaches for discriminating true sources of energy
    used by a given data centre;</p><p>— compares, where relevant, the terms used
    in both the ISO/IEC 30134 series and ISO 52000 series and provides explanations
    on the use of factors for converting final or delivered energy to primary energy
    which take a different approach in each series (and how to move from one to the
    other);</p><p>— illustrates the impact of using the EPB approach on data-centre-energy-related
    key performance indicators (KPIs), both in general and by the provision of examples;</p><p>—
    provides known sources of weighting or conversion factors to be used when there
    are no recognized or agreed local factors applicable to the studied data centre
    energy performance assessment.</p>"
