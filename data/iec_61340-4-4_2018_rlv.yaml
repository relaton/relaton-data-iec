abstract:
- content: "IEC 61340-4-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 61340-4-4:2018 specifies
    requirements for flexible intermediate bulk containers (FIBC) between 0,25 m3
    and 3 m3 in volume, intended for use in hazardous explosive atmospheres. The explosive
    atmosphere can be created by the contents in the FIBC or can exist outside the
    FIBC. The requirements include:<br />\r\n– classification and labelling of FIBC;<br
    />\r\n– classification of inner liners;<br />\r\n– specification of test methods
    for each type of FIBC, inner liner, labels and document pockets;<br />\r\n– design
    and performance requirements for FIBC, inner liners, labels and document pockets;<br
    />\r\n– safe use of FIBC (including those with inner liners) within different
    zones defined for explosion endangered environments, described for areas where
    combustible dusts are, or can be, present (IEC 60079-10-2), and for explosive
    gas atmospheres (IEC 60079-10-1);<br />\r\n– procedures for type qualification
    and certification of FIBC, including the safe use of inner liners. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2012, and Amendment
    1:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) in light of experimental evidence, the maximum resistance to ground limit
    for Type C FIBC, and corresponding resistance limits for inner liners used in
    Type C FIBC has been increased from 10 M ohms to 100 M ohms;<br />\r\nb) the classification
    of Type L1 inner liners has been revised and extended to include Type L1C inner
    liners made from multi-layer materials with a conductive internal layer;<br />\r\nc)
    a labelling requirement to include a reference to IEC TS 60079-32-1 for guidance
    on earthing has been added.</p>"
