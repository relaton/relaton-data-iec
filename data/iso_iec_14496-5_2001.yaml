abstract:
- content: "<p>Reference software is normative in the sense that any conforming implementation
    of the software, taking the same</p><p>conformant bitstreams, using the same output
    file format, will output the same file. Complying ISO/IEC 14496</p><p>implementations
    are not expected to follow the algorithms or the programming techniques used by
    the reference</p><p>software. Although the decoding software is considered normative,
    it cannot add anything to the textual technical</p><p>description included in
    parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of ISO/IEC 14496.</p><p>The software contained in this part
    of ISO/IEC 14496 is divided into three categories:</p><p>a)<strong>Elementary
    stream decoding software</strong>is catalogued in clauses 3, 4 and 5. This software
    accepts</p><p>elementary streams encoded according to the normative specification
    in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of ISO/IEC 14496</p><p>and decodes the streams into the
    media types associated with each elementary stream. While this software</p><p>appears
    in the normative part of this specification, attention is drawn to the fact that
    the implementation</p><p>techniques used in this software are not considered normative?
    several different implementations could</p><p>produce the same result? but the
    software is considered normative in that it correctly implements the decoding</p><p>processes
    described in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of ISO/IEC 14496.</p><p>b)<strong>Elementary
    stream encoding software</strong>is catalogued in Annex A (informative). This
    software creates</p><p>elementary streams from associated media types. The encoders
    are provided as a means to obtain</p><p>elementary streams with the normative
    syntax described in parts 1, 2 and 3 of ISO/IEC 14496. The techniques</p><p>used
    for encoding are not specified by this specification, and the quality and complexity
    of these encoders has</p><p>not been optimized.</p><p>c)<strong>Utility software</strong>is
    catalogued in Annex B (informative). This software was found useful by the developers
    of</p><p>the standard, but may not conform to the normative specifications given
    in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of</p><p>ISO/IEC 14496.</p><p>File locations given in this
    part of ISO/IEC 14496 are expressed relative to its location in the source tree.</p>"
