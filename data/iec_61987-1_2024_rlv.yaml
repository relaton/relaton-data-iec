abstract:
- content: "IEC 61987-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61987-1:2024
    defines a generic structure in which product features of industrial process measurement
    devices shall be arranged, in order to facilitate the understanding of product
    descriptions when they are transferred from one party to another. It applies to
    the production of catalogues supplied by the manufacturer of such devices and
    helps the user to formulate their requirements. This document will also serve
    as a reference document for all future standards which are concerned with process
    measuring equipment.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document also provides a basic
    structure for the production of further standards listing the properties of process
    control equipment, for example, for actuators and infrastructure devices.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Addition of a subclause “Digital communication”
    in Clause 5, in order to allow a more comprehensive description of the properties
    of such an interface;<br />\r\nb) Alignment of clause headings, as described in
    the introduction, to correspond with those of the IEC CDD."
