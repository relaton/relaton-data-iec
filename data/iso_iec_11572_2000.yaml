abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines the signalling procedures and protocol
    for the purpose of circuit-switched Call Control at</p><p>the Q-reference point
    between Private Integrated Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within
    a Private Integrated</p><p>Services Network (PISN).</p><p>The Q reference point
    is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>This International Standard is based upon
    that described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.931, including the provisions for</p><p>symmetrical
    operation described in annex D of that recommendation.</p><p>Service specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300
    387. This International</p><p>Standard contains the stage 3 specification for
    the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1
    and</p><p>stage 2 specifications in ECMA-142, ECMA-148 and ISO/IEC 11584.</p><p>This
    International Standard is applicable to PINXs which interconnect to form a PISN.</p><p>Annex
    ZC is an integral part of this International Standard.</p>"
