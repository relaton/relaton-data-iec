abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard defines the signalling procedures and protocol for the
    purpose of circuit-switched Call Control at the Q-reference point between Private
    Integrated Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is based upon that described in
    ITU-T Recommendation Q.931, including the provisions for symmetrical operation
    described in annex D of that recommendation.<br />\r\nService specifications are
    produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387.
    This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and<br />\r\nstage
    2 specifications in ECMA-142, ECMA-148 and ISO/IEC 11584.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard is applicable to PINXs which interconnect to form a PISN.<br />\r\nAnnex
    ZC is an integral part of this International Standard."
