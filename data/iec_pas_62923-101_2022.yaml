abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 62923-101:2022 primarily provides support to other workgroups to
    include alert requirements in standards in line with Bridge Alert Management (BAM),
    and additionally provides support to designers to implement alert properties so
    that they conform with the BAM requirements. This document is applicable, and
    is intended to provide guidance, when the intention is to implement BAM according
    to IMO Resolution MSC.302(87). Based on the IMO decision to adopt the BAM Performance
    Standard MSC.302(87) as a high level leading umbrella standard for intended implementation
    of BAM, IMO resolved in MSC.302(87), 3.6, that in case of conflict with alert
    requirements in existing performance standards, MSC.302(87) takes precedence.
