abstract:
- content: "IEC 60730-2-11:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60730-2-11:2019 applies
    to energy regulators for use in, on, or in association with equipment, including
    energy regulators for heating, air conditioning and similar applications. The
    equipment may use electricity, gas, oil, solid fuel, solar thermal energy, etc.
    or a combination thereof.<br />\r\nThis standard applies to the inherent safety,
    to the operating values, operating times and operating sequence where these are
    associated with equipment safety, and to the testing of automatic electrical energy
    regulator devices used in, or in association with, equipment.<br />\r\nThis standard
    is also applicable to energy regulators for appliances within the scope of IEC
    60335-1.<br />\r\nThroughout this standard the word “equipment” means “appliance
    and equipment”.<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to automatic electrical energy
    regulators for equipment that may be used by the public, such as equipment intended
    to be used in shops, offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial applications.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to automatic electrical energy regulators designed
    exclusively for industrial process applications unless explicitly mentioned in
    the equipment standard.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to equipment that
    are specifically within the scope of building automation equipment.<br />\r\nThis
    standard is also applicable to individual energy regulators utilized as part of
    a control system or energy regulators which are mechanically integral with multi-functional
    controls having non-electrical outputs.<br />\r\nThis standard applies to controls
    powered by primary or secondary batteries, requirements for which are contained
    within the standard, including Annex V<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision to the title to remove “for
    household and similar use”;<br />\r\nb) changes to the scope and related modifications;<br
    />\r\nc) changes to definitions in Annex H.<br />\r\nThis Part 2-11 is intended
    to be used in conjunction with IEC 60730 1. It was established on the basis of
    the fifth edition of that standard (2013) including Amendment 1 (2015). Consideration
    may be given to future editions of, or amendments to, IEC 60730-1.<br />\r\nKeywords:
