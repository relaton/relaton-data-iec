abstract:
- content: "This document specifies test methods for the exoskeleton-type walking
    RACA robot used as medical electrical equipment which is intended to move from
    one location to another, by making reciprocating motion having intermittent contact
    with the travel surface.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to passive or non-powered
    exoskeletons.<br />\r\nNOTE These tests can be used to verify conformity with
    the requirements of IEC 80601-2-78."
