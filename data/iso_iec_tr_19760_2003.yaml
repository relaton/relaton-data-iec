    application of the International Standard ISO/IEC 15288 Systems Engineering -
    System life cycle processes in regard to systems and projects irrespective of
    size and type. ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 can be used as a companion document to the
    International Standard by those who: apply the International Standard within their
