abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 is a Technical Report that provides guidance
    for application of the International Standard ISO/IEC 15288<em>Systems Engineering
    - System life cycle processes</em> in regard to systems and projects irrespective
    of size and type. ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 can be used as a companion document to
    the International Standard by those who:</p><ol><li>apply the International Standard
    within their organization;</li><li>use the International Standard in regard to
    a specific system;</li><li>prepare organizational and domain specific standards
    based on the International Standard.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 elaborates
    on factors that should be considered when applying the International Standard.
    It does this in the context of the various ways in which ISO/IEC 15288 may be
    applied. ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 provides example application concerns lists for
    user consideration. However, ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 is not intended to provide<em>how-to</em>
    guidance for each application area of the International Standard.</p><p>Guidance
    is provided for appropriate tailoring of the International Standard for application
    to specific systems or projects.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 also provides appropriate
    links to other ISO documents for supporting application of the International Standard
    and to aid in assessing the effectiveness of the application of the International
    Standard.</p>"
