abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61850-90-13:2021(E), which is a Technical Report, provides information,
    use cases, and guidance on whether and how to use deterministic networking technologies.
    Furthermore, this document comprises technology descriptions, provides guidance
    how to achieve compatibility and interoperability with existing technologies,
    and lays out migration paths. It will separate the problem statement from the
    possible solutions.
