abstract:
- content: "<p>Thin flexible cards are used to automate the controls for access to
    goods or services such as mass transit, highway toll systems, car parks, vouchers
    and stored value.</p><p>For these applications, data can be written and/or read
    by machines using various recording techniques: magnetic stripe, optical character
    recognition, bar code, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15457-2:2007 specifies the magnetic
    stripe and encoding characteristics of thin flexible cards at two points in the
    card's life cycle:</p><ul><li>at the point of loading into the card-issuing equipment;</li><li>at
    the point of issue to the public.</li></ul>"
