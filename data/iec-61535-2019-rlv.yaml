  content: "IEC 61535:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61535:2019
    applies to two-wire, up to five-wire installation couplers, including earth, if
    provided, with a rated voltage up to and including 500 V AC or DC and a rated
    connecting capacity up to and including 10 mm2 for permanent connection in electrical
    installations. Installation couplers with additional contacts for voltages other
    than mains voltages are outside the scope of this document. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009 and Amendment 1:2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    enlargement of the scope to DC application;<br />\r\n- addition of further requirements
    as regards DC application (marking, etc.), no additional test procedures were
    deemed necessary; however some modifications were necessary in the normative text;<br
    />\r\n- changes and enhancement of the field of application of installation couplers
    into outdoor applications;<br />\r\n- addition of a suitable temperature range;<br
    />\r\n- updating of the list of normative references, modified to undated references,
    where possible."
