abstract:
- content: "<p>Relayed multicast protocol (RMCP) is a protocol which is used to realize
    a relayed multicast data transport scheme. Different from the conventional IP
    multicast, RMCP can configure a relayed multicast path that multicast traffic
    flows by using intermediate end-hosts. RMCP can be applied to the current unicast
    based IP network where IP multicast is not fully deployed.</p><p>ISO/IEC 16512-1:2016
    addresses the basic concepts needed to specify RMCP for relayed multicast. It
    defines the related terminology and proposes a framework for the future development
    of subsequent protocols. The framework covers network topology including network
    entities and the relationship among them, service scenarios, basic operations,
    and message format.</p>"
