- content: "ISO/IEC TS 22237-3:2018 addresses power supplies to, and power distribution
    within, data centres based upon the criteria and classifications for \"availability\",
    \"physical security\" and \"energy efficiency enablement\" within ISO/IEC TS 22237â€‘1.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TS 22237-3:2018 specifies requirements and recommendations for the
    following:<br />\r\na) power supplies to data centres;<br />\r\nb) power distribution
    systems within data centres;<br />\r\nc) facilities for both normal and emergency
    lighting;<br />\r\nd) equipotential bonding and earthing;<br />\r\ne) lightning
    protection;<br />\r\nf) devices for the measurement of the power consumption characteristics
    at points along the power distribution system and their integration within management
    tools.<br />\r\nSafety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are
    outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and regulations.
    However, information given in this document may be of assistance in meeting these
