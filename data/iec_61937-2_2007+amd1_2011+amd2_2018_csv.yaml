abstract:
- content: "IEC 61937-2:2007+A1:2011+A2:2018 specifies the digital audio interface
    to convey non-linear PCM encoded audio bitstreams applying IEC 60958-1 and IEC
    60958-3. This standard specifies burst-info which defines content information
    about the data contained in the burst payload. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2000. This edition contains the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    New audio data-types of enhanced AC-3 data, MPEG-2 AAC low sampling frequency,
    MPEG-4 AAC, DTS type IV, ATRAC-X, WMA professional and MAT are added.<br />\r\nb)
    Data-type field in Pc is expanded from bit 0-4 to 0-6.<strong>This consolidated
    version consists of the second edition (2007), its amendment 1 (2011) and its
    amendment 2 (2018). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
    publication.</strong>"
