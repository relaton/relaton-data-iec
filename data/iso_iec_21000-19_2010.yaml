abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 21000-19:2010 describes MPEG-21 Media Value Chain Ontology
    (MVCO). The MVCO may be used to capture knowledge about media value chains and
    to represent it in a computer readable way, concepts in the domain and the relationships
    between those concepts.</p><p>ISO/IEC 21000-19:2010 describes the following technology.</p><ul><li>Model:
    the model is described in Clause 6, by way of a narrative description of the Value
    Chain, its main elements and relations.</li><li>Representation: the MVCO has been
    formalised as a normative OWL Ontology, and the description of which is given
    in this Clause. The description consists of listing the classes, the object properties,
    the datatype properties, and the class individuals. Classes are described by giving
    the name, an English definition, the class hierarchy, and the restrictions imposed
    on the class. The representation is given in Clause 7. Annex B<strong></strong>contains
    the normative OWL (XML/RDF) comprising the entire semantics of the elements in
    the model.</li><li>Ontology use: an Informative section is provided with non normative
    descriptions of use, extensions and an API (Annex A).</li></ul>"
