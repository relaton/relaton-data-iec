abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 21000-19:2010 describes MPEG-21 Media Value Chain Ontology (MVCO).
    The MVCO may be used to capture knowledge about media value chains and to represent
    it in a computer readable way, concepts in the domain and the relationships between
    those concepts. ISO/IEC 21000-19:2010 describes the following technology.Model:
    the model is described in Clause 6, by way of a narrative description of the Value
    Chain, its main elements and relations.Representation: the MVCO has been formalised
    as a normative OWL Ontology, and the description of which is given in this Clause.
    The description consists of listing the classes, the object properties, the datatype
    properties, and the class individuals. Classes are described by giving the name,
    an English definition, the class hierarchy, and the restrictions imposed on the
    class. The representation is given in Clause 7. Annex B contains the normative
    OWL (XML/RDF) comprising the entire semantics of the elements in the model.Ontology
    use: an Informative section is provided with non normative descriptions of use,
    extensions and an API (Annex A).'
