  content: "IEC 60335-2-32:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-32:2019
    deals with the safety of electric massage appliances for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances. Examples of appliances within the scope of this
    standard are:<br />\r\n- foot massagers;<br />\r\n- water filled foot massagers;<br
    />\r\n- hand-held massagers;<br />\r\n- massage beds;<br />\r\n- massage belts;<br
    />\r\n- massage chairs;<br />\r\n- massage pads.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended
    for normal household use but that nevertheless may be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- electric foot care appliances that do not contain motors and other electric
    appliances for the care of skin or hair (IEC 60335-2-23)<br />\r\n- electric appliances
    for beauty care of persons and intended for household, commercial and similar
    purposes (IEC 60335-2-115).<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the
    fourth edition published in 2002, Amendment 1: 2008 and Amendment 2:2013. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5, and its Amendments 1 and 2;<br />\r\n-
    note is converted to normative text (11.8);<br />\r\n- additional requirements
    for temperatures of external accessible surfaces (Clause 11);<br />\r\n- alternative
    stability requirements for hand-held appliances (20.2);<br />\r\n- new mechanical
    strength test for hand-held appliances (21.1, 21.101).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is
    to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments.
    It was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
