abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    14843:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Call Offer
    supplementary service (SS-CO) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated
    services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nSS-CO is a supplementary service which, on request
    from the calling user (or on that user's behalf), enables a call to be offered
    to a busy called user and to wait for that called user to accept this call.<br
    />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300
    387. ISO/IEC 14843:2003 contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference
    point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    in ISO/IEC 14841.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-CO operates on top of
    the signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as specified
    in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control
    of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 14843:2003
    also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of
    interactions at the Q reference point between SS-CO and other supplementary services
    and ANFs.<br />\r\nNOTE Additional interactions that have no impact on the signalling
    protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 14843:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form
    a PISN."
