    <p>This document provides guidance on the relationship between ISO/IEC 16350:2015 and a commonly used application management framework, ASL. It can be used by any organization or person wishing to understand how ASL can be used with ISO/IEC 16350:2015, including:</p>
    <p>a)   an internal or external application management organization that has demonstrated or intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015 and is seeking guidance on the use of ASL to establish and improve an AMS and the processes;</p>
    <p>b)   an application management organization that already uses ASL and is seeking guidance on how ASL can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015;</p>
    <p>c)   an assessor or auditor who wishes to understand the use of ASL as support to achieve the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015.</p>
    <p>The correlations provided in this document relate to the 2nd version of ASL® (ASL2).</p>
    <p>Clause 4 describes how ASL® can support the demonstration of conformity to ISO/IEC 16350:2015.</p>
