  content: "IEC TR 62500:2024 which is a Technical Report, considers the targets assigned
    to highly severe stress tests for operating margins research and robustness improvement
    of avionics equipment, their basic principles, their scope of application and
    their implementation process. It is primarily intended for avionics programme
    managers, electronic equipment project managers, designers, test managers, and
    dependability team.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance which can apply to
    all avionics programmes and is of primary interest to the original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs) in charge of designing, developing and producing equipment built for these
    programmes, for obtaining early equipment maturity.<br />\r\nThis document can
    be used in conjunction with IEC 62429, IEC 62506, or both, with regard to dependability
    aspects related to equipment consisting of hardware with embedded software."
