abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63502:2024, which is a Technical Report, gives information relevant
    to the on-site HVDC transmission line parameter measurement. HVDC transmission
    line can be overhead lines, land or submarine cables, or hybrid lines with overhead
    line section(s) and cable section(s) (or any combination of these). This document
    introduces measurement specification, including measurement conditions, safety
    precautions, measurement instrument, measurement methods, etc., in order to measure
    the parameters of HVDC overhead transmission line and cable with a DC voltage
    level above 100 kV.<br />\r\nThis document is also relevant to line parameter
    measurement of earth electrode lines in HVDC power transmission systems."
