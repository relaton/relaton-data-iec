abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30107-3:2023 This document establishes:<br />\r\n- principles
    and methods for the performance assessment of presentation attack detection (PAD)
    mechanisms;<br />\r\n- reporting of testing results from evaluations of PAD mechanisms;
    and<br />\r\n- a classification of known attack types (Annex A).<br />\r\nOutside
    the scope are:<br />\r\n- standardization of specific PAD mechanisms;<br />\r\n-
    detailed information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing techniques), algorithms
    or sensors; and<br />\r\n- overall system-level security or vulnerability assessment.<br
    />\r\nThe attacks considered in this document take place at the biometric capture
    device during presentation. Any other attacks are considered outside the scope
    of this document."
