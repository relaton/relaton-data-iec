  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24709-2:2007 defines a number of test assertions written in
    the assertion language specified in ISO/IEC 24709-1. These assertions enable a
    user of ISO/IEC 24709-2:2007 (such as a testing laboratory) to test the conformance
    to ISO/IEC 19784-1 (BioAPI 2.0) of any biometric service provider (BSP) that claims
    to be a conforming implementation of that International Standard. Each test assertion
    specified in ISO/IEC 24709-2:2007 exercises one or more features of an implementation
    under test. Assertions are placed into packages (one or more assertions per package)
    as required by the assertion language. These assertions allow for testing conformance
    of BSPs of all conformance subclasses, and are further organized according to
    conformance subclasses and claimed support of optional features.</p>"
