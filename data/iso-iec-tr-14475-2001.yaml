    <p>A Private Integrated Service Network (PISN) is a network comprising either one PINX or more than</p>
    <p>one PINX interconnected by Inter-PINX connections. This Technical Report is concerned with inter-</p>
    <p>PINX connections (IPC) that are provided by Intervening Networks (IVN), and the way in which these</p>
    <p>are handled by PINXs to provide a platform for inter-PINX communication. Different types of IVNs</p>
    <p>can be used to provide IPCs, in accordance with the scenarios indicated in ISO/IEC 11579-1. These</p>
    <p>are Overlay Scenarios in that they enable the services of the PISN to operate transparently across</p>
    <p>an IVN.</p>
    <p>Connected PINXs need to co-ordinate their use of IVNs, and appropriate standardisation is needed</p>
    <p>to allow networks to be created employing PINXs and IVNs from multiple vendors. The following</p>
    <p>points need to be considered:</p>
    <p>_ In general but depending on the type of IVN, procedures and signalling protocols between the</p>
    <p>PINXs are needed for the establishment, maintenance and release of IPCs. Appropriate</p>
    <p>standardisation of these procedures and signalling protocols is necessary.</p>
    <p>_ At the Q reference point (a conceptual point within a PINX) channels and PISN call control</p>
    <p>signalling (QSIG) are defined independently of the type of IVN. However, at the C reference</p>
    <p>point (where the PINX is connected to the IVN), the representation of the channels and of</p>
    <p>signalling is dependent on the type of IVN, and on how the PINXs use the IPCs. Appropriate</p>
    <p>standardisation of these aspects at the C reference point is necessary.</p>
    <p>_ In general the relationship between a channel at the Q reference point and its representation at</p>
    <p>the C reference point is not static, and procedures and signalling between the PINXs are needed</p>
    <p>for the co-ordination of these relationships. Appropriate standardisation of these procedures and</p>
    <p>signalling is necessary.</p>
    <p>_ Appropriate mechanisms need to be standardised for conveying inter-PINX signalling through</p>
    <p>the IVN. These will depend on the characteristics of the IPC used.</p>
    <p>The aim of this Technical Report is to identify:</p>
    <p>1. In addition to PISN call control signalling (QSIG), what needs to be standardised, in order to be</p>
    <p>able to inter-connect PINXs;</p>
    <p>2. General techniques, procedures, protocols etc., that apply to of all (or at least very many) types</p>
    <p>of IVNs.</p>
