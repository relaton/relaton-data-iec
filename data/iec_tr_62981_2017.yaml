abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62981:2017(E), which is a Technical Report, provides the results
    of international exercises and comparisons focusing on achieving the knowledge
    of the statistical performance of single sheet tester (SST) measurements made
    on grain-oriented electrical steel. These experiments aim at specifying obligatory
    reference values, measured by the single sheet test method, for the grading of
    high permeability (P grades) grain-oriented (g.-o.) materials, independently from
    the Epstein classification as it is practiced today. Besides this, Epstein test
    measurements have been made in order to gain more up-to-date statistical performance
    for comparison with the SST statistical characteristics. A few experiments were
    carried out aiming at improved knowledge on the systematic error performance of
    the SST, i.e. they were to determine the correlation between the quality of insulation
    separating laminations in the SST yokes and the measured loss.
