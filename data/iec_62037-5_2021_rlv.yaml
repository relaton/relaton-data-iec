abstract:
- content: "IEC 62037-5:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62037-5:2021
    defines test fixtures and procedures recommended for measuring levels of passive
    intermodulation generated by filters, typically used in wireless communication
    systems. The purpose is to define qualification and acceptance test methods for
    filters for use in low intermodulation (low IM) applications. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2013. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. dynamic testing requirements updated to define impact energy and locations
    to apply impacts to devices under test."
