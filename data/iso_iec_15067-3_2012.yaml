abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 15067-3:2012(E) specifies an energy management model for
    programs that manage the consumer demand for electricity using a method known
    as &quot;demand response&quot;. Three types of demand response are specified in
    this standard: direct control, local control and distributed control. It replaces
    ISO&#x2F;IEC TR 15067-3, first edition, published in 2000, and constitutes a technical
    revision. It includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- the demand response options have
    been expanded;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- distributed energy resources such as local
    generation and storage have been included;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- the terminology
    for demand response has been aligned with smart grid."
