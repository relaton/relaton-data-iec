  script: Latn
  content: "IEC 60287-1-1:2023 is applicable to the conditions of steady-state operation
    of cables at all alternating voltages, and direct voltages up to 5 kV, buried
    directly in the ground, in ducts, troughs or in steel pipes, both with and without
    partial drying-out of the soil, as well as cables in air. The term \"steady state\"
    is intended to mean a continuous constant current (100 % load factor) just sufficient
    to produce asymptotically the maximum conductor temperature, the surrounding ambient
    conditions being assumed constant. This document provides formulae for current
    ratings and losses. The formulae given are essentially literal and designedly
    leave open the selection of certain important parameters. These can be divided
    into three groups:<br />\r\n- parameters related to construction of a cable (for
    example, thermal resistivity of insulating material) for which representative
    values have been selected based on published work;<br />\r\n- parameters related
    to the surrounding conditions, which can vary widely, the selection of which depends
    on the country in which the cables are used or will be used;<br />\r\n- parameters
    which result from an agreement between manufacturer and user and which involve
    a margin for security of service (for example, maximum conductor temperature)."
