abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-5-1:2009(E) describes symmetrical pair/quad cables intended
    primarily for horizontal floor cabling as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and ISO/IEC
    24702. It includes additional recommended environmental characteristics and severities
    which are derived from the environmental classifications that are specified for
    cabling for various environments. This edition constitutes a technical revision
    and includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new requirements for new cables Cat6A and Cat7A;<br />\r\n-
    revised requirements and tests for the cables.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with  IEC 61156-1:2007  and  IEC 61156-5:2009."
