  content: "IEC TS 62257-7-4:2019(E), which is a technical specification, specifies
    the design and implementation of hybrid off-grid solar systems, where solar energy
    provides energy to a load in conjunction with other sources of energy. Such systems
    may or may not include an energy storage system. There are a variety of different
    system architectures and applications, and many ways in which these energy sources
    can be combined. This document distinguishes between different sorts of hybrid
    system applications and gives guidance on the design and integration of these
    systems.<br />\r\nIt applies to single-phase and three-phase applications, and
    it covers situations where grid is available as an additional source of power
    for charging batteries and maintaining system reliability, but this document does
    not cover situations in which energy is fed back into a utility grid, although
    such systems may incidentally possess this function."
