abstract:
- content: "IEC 62574:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62574:2020
    specifies the general channel assignment and the metadata for multichannel audio
    format. This document, with its channel mapping and labelling content, provides
    the unified usage of channel assignments for source devices, digital audio interfaces
    and sink devices. The general channel assignment excludes the specification of
    the exact position of each loudspeaker. The metadata has the exact position of
    each loudspeaker; however, since the position of the loudspeaker is different
    in various surround sound formats, the position information of the metadata is
    not standardized. It is aimed at consumer applications; it is not targeted at
    theatrical environments. Up to 65 labels for loudspeaker positions and 15 labels
    for loudspeakers on the display are specified, which can be used for all current
    multichannel audio formats. The channel assignment concept is room centric and
    listener centric. This general channel assignment specifies the position of the
    loudspeaker as seen from the listener.<br />\r\nIEC 62574:2020 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) model of channel assignment spaces is changed;<br
    />\r\nb) definition of channel maps and labels is changed;<br />\r\nc) metadata
    is newly specified;<br />\r\nd) channel maps and labels from the first edition
    are included in Annex A."
