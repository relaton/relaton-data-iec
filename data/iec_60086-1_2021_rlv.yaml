abstract:
- content: "IEC 60086-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60086-1:2021
    is intended to standardize primary batteries with respect to dimensions, nomenclature,
    terminal configurations, markings, test methods, typical performance, safety and
    environmental aspects. This document on one side specifies requirements for primary
    cells and batteries. On the other side, this document also specifies procedures
    of how requirements for these batteries are to be standardised. As a classification
    tool for primary batteries, this document specifies system letters, electrodes,
    electrolytes, and nominal as well as maximum open circuit voltage of electrochemical
    systems. The object of this part of IEC 60086 is to benefit primary battery users,
    device designers and battery manufacturers by ensuring that batteries from different
    manufacturers are interchangeable according to standard form, fit and function.
    Furthermore, to ensure compliance with the above, this part specifies standard
    test methods for testing primary cells and batteries.<br />\r\nThe contents of
    the corrigendum of June 2022 have been included in this copy."
