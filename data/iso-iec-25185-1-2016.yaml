    <p>ISO/IEC 25185-1:2016 provides an authentication protocol suitable for use in physical and logical access control systems based on ICCs and related systems which support standards based AES-128 and RSA-2048 ciphers and the SHA-256 hashing algorithm.</p>
    <p>It specifies PLAID and its implementation in sufficient detail to allow any two or more implementations to be interoperable.</p>
    <p>It does not address how implementations share cryptographic keys, access control system credential records (including revocation) or manage payload entities such as PIN, PINHash, or biometric templates or other payload objects.</p>
