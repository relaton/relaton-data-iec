    <p>The main purpose of ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (XMI) is to enable easy interchange of metadata between application development lifecycle tools (such as modeling tools based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ISO/IEC 19501, and metadata repositories/frameworks based on the Meta Object Facility (MOF), ISO/IEC 19502) in distributed heterogeneous environments. ISO/IEC 19503:2005 integrates three key industry standards:</p>
    <ul><li>XML, eXtensible Markup Language, a W3C standard;</li><li>UML, Unified Modeling Language, an OMG modeling specification which is now ISO/IEC 19501;</li><li>MOF, Meta Object Facility (ISO/IEC 19502).</li></ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19503:2005 provides specifications for</p>
    <ul><li>a set of XML Schema Definitions (XSD) production rules for transforming MOF-based metamodels into XML Schemas;</li><li>a set of XML Document production rules for encoding and decoding MOF-based metadata;</li><li>design principles for XMI-based Schemas and XML documents;</li><li>a set of production rules for importing XML DTDs to a MOF-based metamodel.</li></ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19503:2005 enhances metadata management and metadata interoperability in distributed object environments in general and in distributed development environments in particular. While it addresses stream-based metadata interoperability in the object analysis and design domain, ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (in part because it is MOF based) is equally applicable to metadata in many other domains.</p>
