    bodies providing audit and certification of an information security management
    system (ISMS), in addition to the requirements contained within ISO/IEC 17021
    and ISO/IEC 27001. It is primarily intended to support the accreditation of certification
    bodies providing ISMS certification.</p><p>The requirements contained in ISO/IEC
    27006:2011 need to be demonstrated in terms of competence and reliability by any
    body providing ISMS certification, and the guidance contained in ISO/IEC 27006:2011
    provides additional interpretation of these requirements for any body providing
    ISMS certification.</p>"
