abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-23:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-23:2016 deals
    with the safety of electric appliances for the care of skin or hair of persons
    or animals and intended for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V. Examples of appliances that are within the scope of
    this<br />\r\nstandard are:<br />\r\n- curling combs;<br />\r\n- curling irons;<br
    />\r\n- curling rollers with separate heaters;<br />\r\n- facial saunas;<br />\r\n-
    hairdryers;<br />\r\n- hair straighteners;<br />\r\n- hand dryers;<br />\r\n-
    heaters for detachable curlers and permanent-wave appliances. Appliances covered
    by this standard may incorporate steam-producing or spray-producing devices. Appliances
    not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless may be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. This standard
    deals with the reasonably foreseeable hazards presented by appliances that are
    encountered by all persons. However, in general, it does not take into account
    persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or
    lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction; children playing with the appliance. This
    standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- shavers, hair clippers and similar appliances;<br
    />\r\n- blankets, pads, clothing and similar flexible heating appliances;<br />\r\n-
    appliances for skin exposure to optical radiation;<br />\r\n- sauna heating appliances;<br
    />\r\n- cosmetic and beauty care appliances incorporating lasers and intense light
    sources or appliances intended for medical purposes. This sixth edition cancels
    and replaces the fifth edition published in 2003 including its Amendment 1 (2008)
    and its Amendment 2 (2012). This edition constitutes a technical revision. The
    principal changes in this edition as compared with the fourth edition of IEC 60335-2-23
    are as follows (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\n- added hair straighteners
    to the list of examples covered by the standard;<br />\r\n- modified 7.12 to apply
    to appliances, and not just to hairdryers;<br />\r\n- added new instructions in
    7.12 for hair straighteners and curling irons;<br />\r\n- exempted fixed hairdryers
    and fixed hand dryers from alternative format of instructions;<br />\r\n- excluded
    detachable curler surfaces from temperature rise requirement in Subclause 11.8;<br
    />\r\n- clarified in Subclause 19.7 that the appliance shall not emit flame after
    the test;<br />\r\n- clarified method of test and compliance criteria in Subclause
    21.101;<br />\r\n- added requirement in 22.13 to delineate handles on curling
    irons and hair straighteners;<br />\r\n- in 22.103, added a requirement for protection
    against hair being pulled into hair dryer intake;<br />\r\n- revised Subclause
    24.101 to indicate that protective devices shall not be self-resetting and reviewed
    and converted notes to normative text in Subclauses 19.7, 22.32, and 25.14. It
    was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard. The
    attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers
    and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication
    of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance
    with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised
    tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than
    36 months from the date of its publication.<br />\r\nKey words: Skin Care, Hair
    Care, Curling, Dryers<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with
    IEC 60335-1:2010."
