    <p>This document is an engineering document intended for verifier manufacturers and application specification developers.</p>
    <p>This document describes modifications to the symbol quality methodology defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and a symbology specification. It defines alternative illumination conditions, some new terms and parameters, modifications to the measurement and subsequent grading of certain parameters and the reporting of the grading results.</p>
    <p>This document was developed to assess the symbol quality of direct marked parts, where the mark is applied directly to the surface of the item and the reading device is a two-dimensional imager.</p>
    <p>When application specifications allow, this method is also potentially applicable to symbols produced by other methods. This is appropriate when direct part marked (DPM) symbols and non-DPM symbols are being scanned in the same scanning environment. The symbol grade is reported as a DPM grade rather than as an ISO/IEC 15415 grade.</p>
