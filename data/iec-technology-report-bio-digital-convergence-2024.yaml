  content: "The term bio-digital convergence denotes the convergence of engineering,
    nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology and cognitive science. While
    the concept is at least 20 years old, developments in the area have been turbocharged
    by the fast-paced changes and evolution of information and digital technologies.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nSuch multi-disciplinary solutions are key to tackling global environmental,
    governmental and societal challenges. Breakthroughs in biomedical devices, artificial
    organs and stem cell research have been vital to modern healthcare solutions.
    Agricultural bioengineering or genetic engineering of food helps address global
    challenges around hunger and economic welfare. Strides in environmental monitoring
    are crucial to managing clean air, water or soil. With a rapidly evolving technology
    landscape, it becomes imperative for standards around the area to co-evolve to
    ensure efficient progress.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe IEC Standardization Evaluation
    Group (SEG) 12 on Bio-digital convergence (BDC) has been systematically assessing
    different aspects of BDC: reverse engineering of living systems, human augmentation
    technologies, life systems and bioengineering, agricultural bioengineering, environmental
    bioengineering, and bio-digital social, risk and ethical aspects.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe technology report elaborates on the scope of the working groups focussed
    on these individual domains, and sheds light upon some of their key findings.
    The report takes a comprehensive look at the current standardization landscape
    across these areas and identifies pertinent standardization opportunities. It
    also discusses various market trends in emerging application areas such as neuroscience,
    biosensors, drug discovery, artificial organs or even human augmentation like
    brain-machine interfaces.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report ends with a list of recommendations
    of the working groups to the IEC Standardization Management Board (<a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3228,25\">SMB</a>)
    as well as the results of the Board’s decisions concerning their adoption.<br
