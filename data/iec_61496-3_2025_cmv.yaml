abstract:
- content: "IEC 61496-3:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61496-3:2025 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61496-3:2018
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 44 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61496-3:2025 specifies additional requirements for the design,
    construction and testing of non‑contact electro-sensitive protective equipment
    (ESPE) designed specifically to detect persons or parts of persons as part of
    a safety-related system, employing active opto-electronic protective devices responsive
    to diffuse reflection (AOPDDRs) for the sensing function. Special attention is
    directed to requirements which ensure that an appropriate safety-related performance
    is achieved. An ESPE can include optional safety-related functions, the requirements
    for which are given both in Annex A of this document and in Annex A of IEC 61496‑1:2020.<br
    />\r\nNOTE \"Non-contact\" means that physical contact is not required for sensing.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not specify the dimensions or configurations of the detection
    zone and its disposition in relation to hazardous parts for any particular application,
    nor what constitutes a hazardous state of any machine. It is restricted to the
    functioning of the ESPE and how it interfaces with the machine.<br />\r\nAOPDDRs
    are devices that have either<br />\r\n- one or more detection zone(s) specified
    in two dimensions (AOPDDR-2D), or<br />\r\n- one or more detection zone(s) specified
    in three dimensions (AOPDDR-3D)<br />\r\nwherein radiation in the near infrared
    range is emitted by an emitting element(s). When the emitted radiation impinges
    on an object (for example, a person or part of a person), a portion of the emitted
    radiation is reflected to a receiving element(s) by diffuse reflection. This reflection
    is used to determine the position of the object.<br />\r\nOpto-electronic devices
    that perform only a single one-dimensional spot-like distance measure­ment, for
    example, optical proximity switches, are not covered by this document.<br />\r\nThis
    document is limited to ESPE that do not require human intervention for detection.
    It is limited to ESPE that detect objects entering into or being present in a
    detection zone(s).<br />\r\nThis document does not address those aspects required
    for complex classification or differentiation of the object detected.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not address requirements and tests for outdoor application.<br />\r\nExcluded
    from this document are AOPDDRs employing radiation with the peak of wavelength
    outside the range 820 nm to 1 100 nm, and those employing radiation other than
    that generated by the AOPDDR itself. For sensing devices that employ radiation
    of wavelengths outside this range, this document can be used as a guide. This
    document is relevant for AOPDDRs having a minimum detectable object size in the
    range from 30 mm to 200 mm.<br />\r\nThis document can be relevant to applications
    other than those for the protection of persons, for example, for the protection
    of machinery or products from mechanical damage. In those applications, different
    requirements can be appropriate, for example when the materials that are recognized
    by the sensing function have different properties from those of persons and their
    clothing.<br />\r\nThis document does not deal with electromagnetic compatibility
    (EMC) emission requirements.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) some requirement clauses and test procedures
    have been adapted or removed because they have been consolidated in IEC 61496-1:2020
    (e.g. 5.4.6.2 Light sources and Clause A.9);<br />\r\nb) change of the minimum
    probability of detection and fault detection requirements for Type 2 AOPDDR;<br
    />\r\nc) using the AOPDDR as a trip device is described as an optional function
    in Clause A.13."
