abstract:
- content: "IEC 62037-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62037-1:2021
    deals with the general requirements and measuring methods for intermodulation
    (IM) level measurement of passive RF and microwave components, which can be caused
    by the presence of two or more transmitting signals. The test procedures given
    in this document give the general requirements and measurement methods required
    to characterize the level of unwanted IM signals using two transmitting signals.
    The IEC 62037 series addresses the measurement of PIM, but does not cover the
    long-term reliability of a product with reference to its performance. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na. clarification added that test equipment may utilize pulsed
    generators to reduce power consumption;<br />\r\nb. heating effect differences
    in the device under test noted in Annex B for tests conducted using pulsed generators;<br
    />\r\nc. guidance added in Annex B to improve probability of detection of short
    duration PIM events while dynamic testing."
