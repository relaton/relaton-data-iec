  content: "<p>This International Standard provides a specification language, UPDM,
    that is readily understandable not only by the community of architects of information
    technology systems but also by a wide range of end users including executives
    and enterprise management that sponsor such systems, program managers that oversee
    their development, developers of supporting hardware and software (design, implementation,
    and testing), subject matter experts, and end users. UPDM bridges the gap from
    setting of requirements to high level system design and to visualization for practitioners.
    While designed in the context of military organizations and their procurement
    processes, UPDM can also be applied in entirely civilian industrial and service
    organization contexts. UPDM 2.1.1 supports the capability to: ? model architectures
    for a broad range of complex systems, which may include hardware, software, data,
    personnel, and facility elements; ? model consistent architectures for system-of-systems
    down to lower levels of design and implementation; ? model service oriented architectures;
    ? support the analysis, specification, design, and verification of complex systems;
    and ? improve the ability to exchange architecture information among related tools
    that are UML based and tools that are based on other standards. The profile provides
    the modeling of operational capabilities, services, system activities, nodes,
    system functions, ports, protocols, interfaces, performance, and physical properties
    and units of measure. In addition, the profile enables the modeling of related
    architecture concepts such as DoD's doctrine, organization, training material,
    leadership &amp; education, personnel, and facilities (DOTMLPF) and the equivalent
    UK Ministry of Defence Lines of Development (DLOD) elements. UPDM 2.1.1, as illustrated
    in Figure 1.1, addresses DoDAF and MODAF Viewpoints as well as enabling extensions
    to new architecture perspectives (e.g., Services views, Custom views, Logistics
    views cost views, etc.). MODAF terminology has been used for simplicity.</p>"
