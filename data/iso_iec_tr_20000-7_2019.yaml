abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 20000-7:2019 This document provides guidance on the integrated
    implementation of a service management system (SMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1
    with a quality management system (QMS) as specified in ISO 9001 and an information
    security management system (ISMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 27001. It is aimed at
    those organizations that are intending to either:<br />\r\na) implement ISO 9001
    when ISO/IEC 20000-1 is already implemented, or vice versa;<br />\r\nb) implement
    ISO/IEC 27001 when ISO/IEC 20000-1 is already implemented, or vice versa;<br />\r\nc)
    implement both ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 together, or implement both ISO/IEC
    27001 and ISO/IEC 20000-1 together;<br />\r\nd) implement ISO/IEC 20000-1, ISO
    9001 and ISO/IEC 27001 together; or<br />\r\ne) integrate existing management
    systems based on ISO/IEC 20000-1, ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 27001.<br />\r\nIn practice,
    an SMS, QMS or ISMS can also be integrated with other management system standards
    (MSS), such as ISO 22301 or ISO 55001.<br />\r\nClause 4 provides an introduction
    to ISO/IEC 20000-1, the HLS of MSS specified in ISO/IEC Directives Part 1 and
    considerations for the integration of an MSS.<br />\r\nClause 5 provides an introduction
    to ISO 9001, commonalities and differences with ISO/IEC 20000-1 and considerations
    for the integration of an SMS with a QMS.<br />\r\nClause 6 provides an introduction
    to ISO/IEC 27001, commonalities and differences with ISO/IEC 20000-1 and considerations
    for the integration of an SMS with an ISMS.<br />\r\nClause 7 looks at considerations
    for the integration of an SMS, a QMS, and an ISMS.<br />\r\nThis document also
    provides correlation information for the terms and definitions of ISO/IEC 20000-1
    with ISO 9001 and ISO/IEC 27001 in Annex A. Correlation of the clauses of ISO/IEC
    20000-1 with ISO 9001 is shown in Annex B. Correlation of the clauses of ISO/IEC
    20000-1 with ISO/IEC 27001 is shown in Annex C."
