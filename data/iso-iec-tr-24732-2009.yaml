    <p>ISO/IEC TR 24732:2009 specifies an extension to the programming language C, specified by the International Standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999. The extension provides support for decimal floating-point arithmetic that is intended to be consistent with the specification in IEEE 754-2008. Any conflict between the requirements described here and that specification is unintentional. ISO/IEC TR 24732:2009 defers to IEEE 754-2008.</p>
    <p>The binary floating-point arithmetic as specified in IEEE 754-2008 is not considered in ISO/IEC TR 24732:2009.</p>
