- content: lays the foundation for agreement on the fundamental terms and definitions
    to be used world wide in describing the transmission properties of a two-port
    or quadripole end and builds a bridge between the classical quadripole theory
    and the scattering matrix presentation which is based on incident and reflecting
    square root of power waves at the input and output of a two-port.
