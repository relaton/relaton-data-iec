abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29167-22:2018 This document defines the crypto suite for SPECK
    for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for
    RFID devices that can be referred to by ISO committees for air interface standards
    and application standards. The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing
    air interfaces.<br />\r\nSPECK is a symmetric block cipher that is parameterized
    in both its block length and key length. In this document, a variety of block/key
    length options are supported.<br />\r\nThis document defines various methods of
    use for the cipher.<br />\r\nA Tag and an Interrogator can support one, a subset,
    or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported."
