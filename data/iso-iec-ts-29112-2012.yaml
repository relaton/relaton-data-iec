    <p>ISO/IEC 29112 defines methods for the objective measurement of the print quality characteristics that contribute to the perceived resolution of reflection mode monochrome printed pages produced by digital electro-photographic printers.</p>

    <p>The measurement methods used in ISO/IEC 29112 are derived from several existing techniques for the assessment of an imaging system's resolution characteristics. Each of these measurement methods is intended for the engineering evaluation of a printing system's perceived resolution and not for purposes of advertising claims.</p>

    <p>The methods are applicable only to monochrome prints produced in reflection mode by electro-photographic printing technology.</p>

    <p>ISO/IEC 29112 is intended for monochrome printers utilizing postscript interpreters capable of accepting postscript and encapsulated postscript (EPS) jobs.</p>
