abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62898-2:2018+AMD1:2023 provides guidelines for operation of microgrids.
    Microgrids considered in this document are alternating current (AC) electrical
    systems with loads and distributed energy resources (DER) at low or medium voltage
    level. This document does not cover direct current (DC) microgrids. IEC TS 62898-2
    applies to operation and control of microgrids, including:<br />\r\n- operation
    modes and mode transfer;<br />\r\n- energy management system (EMS) and control
    of microgrids;<br />\r\n- communication and monitoring procedures;<br />\r\n-
    electrical energy storage;<br />\r\n- protection principle covering: principle
    for non-isolated microgrid, isolated microgrid, anti-islanding, synchronization
    and reclosing, power quality;<br />\r\n- commissioning, maintenance and test."
