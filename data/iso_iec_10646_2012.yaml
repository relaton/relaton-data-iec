abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10646:2012 specifies the Universal Character Set (UCS). It
    is applicable to the representation, transmission, interchange, processing, storage,
    input and presentation of the written form of the languages of the world as well
    as additional symbols. It covers 110 181 characters from the world's scripts.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    10646:2012:</p><ul><li>specifies the architecture of ISO/IEC 10646.</li><li>defines
    terms used in ISO/IEC 10646.</li><li>describes the general structure of the UCS
    codespace.</li><li>specifies the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the UCS.</li><li>specifies
    supplementary planes of the UCS: the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), the
    Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP), the Tertiary Ideographic Plane (TIP), and
    the Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP).</li><li>defines a set of graphic
    characters used in scripts and the written form of languages on a world-wide scale.</li><li>specifies
    the names for the graphic characters and format characters of the BMP, SMP, SIP,
    SSP and their coded representations within the UCS codespace. (Note: TIP is currently
    empty).</li><li>specifies the coded representations for control characters and
    private use characters.</li><li>specifies three encoding forms of the UCS: UTF-8,
    UTF-16, and UTF-32.</li><li>specifies seven encoding schemes of the UCS: UTF-8,
    UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.</li><li>specifies
    the management of future additions to this coded character set.</li></ul><p>The
    charts of the ideographic characters are now in multi-column format.</p><p>The
    UCS is an encoding system different from that specified in ISO/IEC 2022. The method
    to designate UCS from ISO/IEC 2022 is specified in 12.2.</p><p>A graphic character
    will be assigned only one code point in the standard, located either in the BMP
    or in one of the supplementary planes.</p><p>By defining a consistent way of encoding
    multilingual text, ISO/IEC 10646:2012 enables the exchange of data internationally.
    The information technology industry gains data stability, greater global interoperability
    and data interchange. ISO/IEC 10646 has been widely adopted on the World Wide
    Web and implemented in modern operating systems and computer languages.</p>"
