abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 10646:2012 specifies the Universal Character Set (UCS). It is
    applicable to the representation, transmission, interchange, processing, storage,
    input and presentation of the written form of the languages of the world as well
    as additional symbols. It covers 110 181 characters from the world's scripts.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 10646:2012:<br /><br />\r\nspecifies the architecture of ISO/IEC
    10646.<br />\r\ndefines terms used in ISO/IEC 10646.<br />\r\ndescribes the general
    structure of the UCS codespace.<br />\r\nspecifies the Basic Multilingual Plane
    (BMP) of the UCS.<br />\r\nspecifies supplementary planes of the UCS: the Supplementary
    Multilingual Plane (SMP), the Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP), the Tertiary
    Ideographic Plane (TIP), and the Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP).<br
    />\r\ndefines a set of graphic characters used in scripts and the written form
    of languages on a world-wide scale.<br />\r\nspecifies the names for the graphic
    characters and format characters of the BMP, SMP, SIP, SSP and their coded representations
    within the UCS codespace. (Note: TIP is currently empty).<br />\r\nspecifies the
    coded representations for control characters and private use characters.<br />\r\nspecifies
    three encoding forms of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32.<br />\r\nspecifies
    seven encoding schemes of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32,
    UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE.<br />\r\nspecifies the management of future additions
    to this coded character set.<br /><br /><br />\r\nThe charts of the ideographic
    characters are now in multi-column format.<br /><br />\r\nThe UCS is an encoding
    system different from that specified in ISO/IEC 2022. The method to designate
    UCS from ISO/IEC 2022 is specified in 12.2.<br /><br />\r\nA graphic character
    will be assigned only one code point in the standard, located either in the BMP
    or in one of the supplementary planes.<br /><br />\r\nBy defining a consistent
    way of encoding multilingual text, ISO/IEC 10646:2012 enables the exchange of
    data internationally. The information technology industry gains data stability,
    greater global interoperability and data interchange. ISO/IEC 10646 has been widely
    adopted on the World Wide Web and implemented in modern operating systems and
    computer languages."
