abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Wireless terminal call handling
    additional network features (ANF-WTMI,</p><p>ANF-WTMO), which are applicable to
    various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks</p><p>(PISN).
    Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>Additional network feature
    Wireless terminal incoming call (ANF-WTMI) directs incoming calls to a WTMI user</p><p>within
    a PISN regardless of the WTMI user's geographical location within the PISN, provided
    the WTMI user's</p><p>location is known.</p><p>Additional network feature Wireless
    terminal outgoing call (ANF-WTMO) detects an outgoing call from a WTMO</p><p>user
    and establishes it as a basic call, regardless of the user's geographical location
    within the PISN. It also</p><p>provides the WTMO user's service profile for use
    by outgoing call control, or alternatively passes the call to the</p><p>WTMO user's
    home location for processing.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three
    stages, according to the method described in CCITT Recommendation</p><p>I.130.
    This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of
    ANF-WTMI and ANF-WTMO.</p><p>The stage 1 specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies
    the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2</p><p>specification (clauses
    8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the service and the information
    flows</p><p>between them.</p>"
