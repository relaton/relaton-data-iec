abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the Wireless terminal call handling additional
    network features (ANF-WTMI, ANF-WTMO), which are applicable to various basic services
    supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified
    in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nAdditional network feature Wireless terminal incoming
    call (ANF-WTMI) directs incoming calls to a WTMI user within a PISN regardless
    of the WTMI user's geographical location within the PISN, provided the WTMI user's
    location is known.<br />\r\nAdditional network feature Wireless terminal outgoing
    call (ANF-WTMO) detects an outgoing call from a WTMO user and establishes it as
    a basic call, regardless of the user's geographical location within the PISN.
    It also provides the WTMO user's service profile for use by outgoing call control,
    or alternatively passes the call to the WTMO user's home location for processing.<br
    />\r\nService specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method
    described in CCITT Recommendation I.130. This International Standard contains
    the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-WTMI and ANF-WTMO.<br />\r\nThe
    stage 1 specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies the service as seen by users
    of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clauses 8 and 9) identifies the functional
    entities involved in the service and the information flows between them."
