abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-20:2006 defines a scene description format (LASeR) and an
    aggregation format (SAF) suitable for representing and delivering rich-media services
    to resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones. A rich media service is
    a dynamic, interactive collection of multimedia data such as audio, video, graphics,
    and text. Services range from movies enriched with vector graphic overlays and
    interactivity (possibly enhanced with closed captions) to complex multi-step services
    with fluid interaction and different media types at each step.<br /><br />\r\nLASeR
    aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the scene description
    level. LASeR supports:<br />\r\nan optimized set of objects inherited from SVG
    to describe rich-media scenes;<br />\r\na small set of key compatible extensions
    over SVG;<br />\r\nthe ability to encode and transmit a LASeR stream and then
    reconstruct SVG content;<br />\r\ndynamic updating of the scene to achieve a reactive,
    smooth and continuous service;<br />\r\nsimple yet efficient compression to improve
    delivery and parsing times, as well as storage size, one of the design goals being
    to allow both for a direct implementation of the SDL as documented, as well as
    for a decoder compliant with ISO/IEC 23001-1 to decode the LASeR bitstream;<br
    />\r\nan efficient interface with audio and visual streams with frame-accurate
    synchronization;<br />\r\nuse of any font format, including the OpenType industry
    standard; and<br />\r\neasy conversion from other popular rich-media formats in
    order to leverage existing content and developer communities."
