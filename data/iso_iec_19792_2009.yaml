abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19792:2009 specifies the subjects to be addressed during a security
    evaluation of a biometric system.It covers the biometric-specific aspects and
    principles to be considered during the security evaluation of a biometric system.
    It does not address the non-biometric aspects which might form part of the overall
    security evaluation of a system using biometric technology (e.g. requirements
    on databases or communication channels). ISO/IEC 19792:2009 does not aim to define
    any concrete methodology for the security evaluation of biometric systems but
    instead focuses on the principal requirements. As such, the requirements in ISO/IEC
    19792:2009 are independent of any evaluation or certification scheme and will
    need to be incorporated into and adapted before being used in the context of a
    concrete scheme.ISO/IEC 19792:2009 defines various areas that are important to
    be considered during a security evaluation of a biometric system.ISO/IEC 19792:2009
    is relevant to both evaluator and developer communities.It specifies requirements
    for evaluators and provides guidance on performing a security evaluation of a
    biometric system.It serves to inform developers of the requirements for biometric
    security evaluations to help them prepare for security evaluations.Although ISO/IEC
    19792:2009 is independent of any specific evaluation scheme it could serve as
    a framework for the development of concrete evaluation and testing methodologies
    to integrate the requirements for biometric evaluations into existing evaluation
    and certification schemes.
