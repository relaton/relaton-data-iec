abstract:
- content: "IEC 62341-5-3:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62341-5-3:2019
    specifies the standard measuring methods for determining the image sticking and
    lifetime of organic light emitting diode (OLED) display panels and modules, except
    finalized display products for end customers, such as TV sets, monitor sets and
    mobile phones. The measuring method for the lifetime mainly applies to modules.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the measurement vehicle for lifetime is only
    for the module;<br />\r\nb) the measurement method for monitor or TV devices is
    modified;<br />\r\nc) the digital signage display is included as an example of
    OLED devices;<br />\r\nd) the measurement method with HDR (high dynamic range)
    for image sticking is added;<br />\r\ne) the analysis method with CIEDE 2000 is
    added for image sticking;<br />\r\nf) the information method for evaluating image
    sticking is modified."
