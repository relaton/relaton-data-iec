abstract:
- content: The GS1 Reduced Space Symbology (RSS) family contains three linear symbologies
    (RSS-14, RSS Limited and RSS Expanded) to be used with the GS1 system. The use
    of the symbology is intended to comply with the GS1 application guidelines as
    defined in the GS1 General Specifications.RSS-14 encodes the full 14-digit GS1
    item identification in a linear symbol that can be scanned omnidirectionally by
    suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners. RSS Limited encodes a 14-digit GS1
    item?identification with Indicator digits of zero or one in a linear symbol for
    use on small items that will not be scanned at the point-of-sale. RSS Expanded
    encodes GS1 item identification plus supplementary AI element strings such as
    weight and 'best before' date in a linear symbol that can be scanned omnidirectionally
    by suitably programmed point-of-sale scanners. RSS-14 Stacked is a variation of
    the RSS-14 symbology that is stacked in two rows and is used when the normal symbol
    would be too wide for the application. It comes in two versions, a truncated version
    used for small item marking applications and a taller omnidirectional version
    which is designed to be read by omnidirectional scanners. RSS Expanded can also
    be printed in multiple rows as a stacked symbol.Any member of the RSS family can
    be printed as a stand-alone linear symbol or as part of an EAN.UCC Composite symbol
    with an accompanying two-dimensional component printed above the RSS linear component.GS1
    RSS bar code symbols are intended for encoding identification numbers and data
    supplementary to the identification. The administration of the numbering system
    by EAN and UCC ensures that identification codes assigned to particular items
    are unique worldwide and that they and the associated supplementary data are defined
    in a consistent way. The major benefit for the users of the GS1 system is the
    availability of uniquely defined identification codes and supplementary data formats
    for use in their trading transactions.ISO/IEC 24724:2006 defines the requirements
    for the RSS symbology family. It specifies the characteristics of the RSS symbology
    family, data character encodation, symbol formats, dimensions, print quality requirements,
    error detection, and decoding algorithms. For EAN.UCC Composite symbols, ISO/IEC
    24723 defines the two-dimensional component.
