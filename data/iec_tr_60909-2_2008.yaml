abstract:
- content: "IEC 60909-2:2008(E) comprises data of electrical equipment collected from
    different countries to be used when necessary for the calculation of short-circuit
    currents in accordance with IEC 60909-0. It may be applied for calculating short-circuit
    currents in low-voltage networks if they are in accordance with typical equipment
    employed in the user's country. The collected data and their evaluation may be
    used for medium- or high-voltage planning purposes and also for comparison with
    data given by manufacturers or electricity suppliers. For overhead lines and cables
    the electrical data may in some cases also be calculated from the physical dimensions
    and the material following the equations given in this report. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1992 and constitutes a technical
    revision. The significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition
    are as follows:<br />\r\n- Subclause 2.5 gives equations and examples for the
    calculation of the positive-, the negative- and the zero-sequence impedances and
    reduction factors for high-, medium and low-voltage cables with sheaths and shields
    earthed at both ends.<br />\r\n- Subclause 2.7 gives equations and figures for
    the calculation of the positive-sequence impedances of busbar configurations."
