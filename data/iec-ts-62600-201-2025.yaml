  content: "IEC TS 62600-201:2025 establishes a system for analysing and reporting,
    through estimation or direct measurement, the theoretical tidal current energy
    resource in oceanic areas including estuaries (to the limit of tidal influence)
    that can be suitable for the installation of one or more TECs. It is intended
    to be applied at various stages of project life cycle to provide suitably accurate
    estimates of the tidal resource to enable the arrays’ projected annual energy
    production to be calculated at each TEC location in conjunction with IEC TS 62600-200.<br
    />\r\nThe purpose of this document is to provide a uniform methodology that will
    ensure consistency and accuracy in the estimation, measurement, characterization
    and analysis of the theoretical tidal current resource at sites that could be
    suitable for the installation of individual or arrays of Tidal Energy Converters
    (TECs), together with defining a standardised methodology with which this resource
    can be described and reported. Application of the estimation, measurement and
    analysis techniques recommended in this document will ensure that resource assessment
    is undertaken in a consistent and accurate manner. This document presents techniques
    that are expected to provide fair and suitably accurate results that can be replicated
    by others.<br />\r\nThis document describes only the aspects of the resource required
    to calculate AEP and assess its uncertainty; e.g. it does not describe aspects
    of the resource required to evaluate design loads or to satisfy environmental
    regulations. Furthermore, this document is not intended to cover every eventuality
    that can be relevant for any particular project. Therefore, this document assumes
    that the user has access to, and reviews, other relevant IEC documentation before
    undertaking work (e.g. surveys and modelling) which could also satisfy other requirements."
