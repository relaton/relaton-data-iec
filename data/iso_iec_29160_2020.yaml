abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the design and use of the RFID Emblem: an easily
    identified visual guide that indicates the presence of radio frequency identification
    (RFID). It does not address the location of the RFID Emblem on a label. Specific
    placement requirements are left to application standards developers.</p><p>This
    document also specifies an RFID Index, which can be included in the RFID Emblem
    and which addresses the complication added by the wide range of RFID tags in existence
    (frequency, protocol and data structure). The RFID Index is a two-character code
    that provides specific information about tags and interrogators. Successful reading
    of RFID tags requires knowledge of the frequency, protocol and data structure
    information provided by the RFID Index.</p>"
