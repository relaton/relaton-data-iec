abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 29186:2012 is a supplement to CIE 156:2004, applicable for use
    in evaluating the colour gamut mapping algorithms of office colour softcopy and
    hardcopy equipment. ISO/IEC TR 29186:2012 defines test charts, test chart image
    processing workflow, media, viewing conditions, measurements, colour spaces and
    experimental methods, suitable for use with office equipment, which either do
    not exist in CIE 156:2004 or are different from CIE 156:2004. Colour softcopy
    may be displayed on monitors, incorporating display technologies such as CRT and
    LCD. Colour hardcopy may be produced by non-impact colour printers, including
    technologies such as ink jet and electro photography.
