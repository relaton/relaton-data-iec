abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 62282-6-150:2011(E) covers micro fuel cell power systems using
    hydrogen produced from the reaction of an aqueous solution with solid UN Division
    4.3 (water-reactive) compounds in indirect PEM fuel cell systems that are wearable
    or easily carried by hand, providing d.c. outputs that do not exceed 60 V d.c.
    and power outputs that do not exceed 240 VA.
