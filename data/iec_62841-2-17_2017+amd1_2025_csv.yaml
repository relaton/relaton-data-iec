abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-17:2017+AMD1:2025 CSV applies to routers intended for cutting
    slots into or shaping the edge of various materials. The rated voltage is not
    more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools, and 480 V for three-phase
    a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W. The limits for the applicability
    of this standard for battery tools are given in K.1 and L.1. This standard deals
    with the hazards presented by tools which are encountered by all persons in the
    normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the tools. Hand-held electric
    tools, which can be mounted on a support or working stand for use as fixed tools
    without any alteration of the tool itself, are within the scope of this standard
    and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support is considered to be a transportable
    tool and thus covered by the relevant Part 3.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 62841
    does not apply to jointers.<br />\r\nRouters that are primarily used for trimming
    the edge of materials are also known as trimmers.<br />\r\nRouters that are used
    to cut various materials through the rotary action are also known as rotary cutters.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2-17 is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC
    62841-1:2014.<br />\r\nThe attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact
    that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional
    period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which
    to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves
    for conducting new or revised tests.<br />\r\nIt is the recommendation of the
    committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally
    not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication."
