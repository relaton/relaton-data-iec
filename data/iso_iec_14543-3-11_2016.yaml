abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14543-3-11:2016(E) specifies an OSI Layers 1 to 3 Frequency
    Modulated Wireless Protocol for low-power devices such as energy harvested devices
    in a home environment. The protocol is specifically designed to keep the energy
    consumption of such sensors and switches extremely low.
