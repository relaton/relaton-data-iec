abstract:
- content: "IEC 61800-9-2:2023+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies energy efficiency indicators
    of power electronics (complete drive modules (CDM), input or output sub drive
    modules (SDM), power drive systems (PDS) and motor starters, all used for motor
    driven equipment.<br />\r\nIt defines IE and IES classes, their limit values and
    provides test procedures for the classification of the overall losses of the motor
    system. Furthermore, this document proposes a methodology for the implementation
    of the best energy efficiency solution of drive systems. This depends on the architecture
    of the motor driven system, on the speed/torque profile and on the operating points
    over time of the driven load equipment. It provides a link for the energy efficiency
    evaluation and classification of the extended product.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Additional IES Classes defined to IES5;<br />\r\nb) Removed reference
    motor loss data and now point to IEC 60034-30-2;<br />\r\nc) Expanded and modified
    factors in Clause 6 for CDMs;<br />\r\nd) Annex C is now the Mathematical Model
    for CDM Losses;<br />\r\ne) Moved the mathematical model for the CDM to Annex
    C;<br />\r\nf) Added Sub Drive Input Module and Sub Drive Output Modules to Annex
    B;<br />\r\ng) Annex D is now the Converter Topology (old Annex C);<br />\r\nh)
    Annex E is now the Interpolation of Motor Losses (Old Annex D);<br />\r\ni) Annex
    E expanded to include various motor connections and updated interpolation method;<br
    />\r\nj) New Annex E for determination of Interpolation Coefficients;<br />\r\nk)
    Annex F is the old Annex E;<br />\r\nl) New Annex J Explanation of Correction
    Factors for the Reference Losses in Table 8."
