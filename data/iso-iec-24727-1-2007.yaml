    <p>ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic services for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to ISO/IEC 7816-4.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 specifies</p>
    <ul><li>system architecture and principles of operation,</li><li>a capabilities discovery mechanism,</li><li>security rationale.</li></ul>
    <p>It does not cover the internal implementation within the card or the outside world.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 is independent of the physical interface technology. It applies to cards accessed by one or more of the following methods: contacts, close coupling and radio frequency.</p>
