  content: "IEC TR 63400:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 63400:2025
    augments that description to enable users of individual IEC SC 45A standards to
    obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the overall structure of the series
    and its relationship with other standards bodies and standards. The publication
    of this document and its subsequent editions should also enable minor changes
    in the structure to be described without the need for amending the common description
    that is included in the Introduction, item d), of all IEC SC 45A documents."
