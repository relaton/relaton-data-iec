  content: "ISO/IEC 30141:2024 provides a standardized IoT Reference Architecture
    using a common vocabulary, reusable designs and industry best practices. It uses
    a top down approach, beginning with collecting the most important characteristics
    of IoT, and abstracting those into a foundational view, then providing five more
    views including a construction view with a set of architecture and design patterns
    for building IoT systems.\r\n<p>This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) conformance with ISO/IEC/IEEE 42010:2022;<br />\r\nb)
    improved usability;<br />\r\nc) implementation pattern support.</p>"
