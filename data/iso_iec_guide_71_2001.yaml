abstract:
- content: "<p><strong>1.1</strong>This Guide provides guidance to writers of relevant
    International Standards on how to take into account the needs of older persons
    and persons with disabilities. Whilst recognizing that some people with very extensive
    and complex disabilities may have requirements beyond the level addressed in this
    Guide, a very large number of people have minor impairments which can be easily
    addressed by relatively small changes of approach in standards, thereby increasing
    the market for the product or service.</p><p>This Guide aims</p><ol><li>to inform,
    increase understanding and raise awareness about how human abilities impact on
    the usability of products, services and environments,</li><li>to outline the relationship
    between the requirements in standards and the accessibility and usability of products
    and services, and</li><li>to raise awareness about the benefits of adopting accessible
    design principles in terms of a wider market.</li></ol><p><strong>1.2</strong>This
    Guide applies to products, services and environments encountered in all aspects
    of daily life and intended for the consumer market and the workplace. For the
    purposes of this document, the term 'products and services' is used to reflect
    all these purposes.</p><p><strong>1.3</strong>This Guide</p><ol><li>describes
    a process by which the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities may
    be considered in the development of standards,</li><li>provides tables to enable
    standards developers to relate the relevant clauses of a standard to the factors
    which should be considered to ensure that all abilities are addressed,</li><li>offers
    descriptions of body functions or human abilities and the practical implications
    of impairment,</li><li>offers a list of sources that standards developers can
    use to investigate more detailed and specific guidance materials.</li></ol><p><strong>1.4</strong>This
    Guide provides general guidance. Consideration should be given to the development
    of additional guides for specific product or service sectors.</p><p><strong>1.5</strong>While
    it is recognized that accessibility and usability are important for both products
    amd services, international work on services standards is at the preliminary stage.
    At present, this Guide contains considerably more guidance on products than on
    services.</p><p><strong>1.6</strong>This Guide is also available as a Braille
    version. Copies may be obtained through the ISO Central Secretariat.</p>"
