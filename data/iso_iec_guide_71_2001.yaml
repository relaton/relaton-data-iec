abstract:
- content: 1.1  This Guide provides guidance to writers of relevant International
    Standards on how to take into account the needs of older persons and persons with
    disabilities. Whilst recognizing that some people with very extensive and complex
    disabilities may have requirements beyond the level addressed in this Guide, a
    very large number of people have minor impairments which can be easily addressed
    by relatively small changes of approach in standards, thereby increasing the market
    for the product or service.   This Guide aims    to inform, increase understanding
    and raise awareness about how human abilities impact on the usability of products,
    services and environments,  to outline the relationship between the requirements
    in standards and the accessibility and usability of products and services, and  to
    raise awareness about the benefits of adopting accessible design principles in
    terms of a wider market.      1.2  This Guide applies to products, services and
    environments encountered in all aspects of daily life and intended for the consumer
    market and the workplace. For the purposes of this document, the term 'products
    and services' is used to reflect all these purposes.    1.3  This Guide    describes
    a process by which the needs of older persons and persons with disabilities may
    be considered in the development of standards,  provides tables to enable standards
    developers to relate the relevant clauses of a standard to the factors which should
    be considered to ensure that all abilities are addressed,  offers descriptions
    of body functions or human abilities and the practical implications of impairment,  offers
    a list of sources that standards developers can use to investigate more detailed
    and specific guidance materials.      1.4  This Guide provides general guidance.
    Consideration should be given to the development of additional guides for specific
    product or service sectors.    1.5  While it is recognized that accessibility
    and usability are important for both products amd services, international work
    on services standards is at the preliminary stage. At present, this Guide contains
    considerably more guidance on products than on services.    1.6  This Guide is
    also available as a Braille version. Copies may be obtained through the ISO Central
    Secretariat.
