abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63202-3:2023 describes procedures for the measurement of current-voltage
    (I-V) characteristics of crystalline silicon bifacial photovoltaic (PV) cells
    for both laboratory and mass production applications.<br />\r\nThis document is
    intended to be used for measurement of individual unencapsulated bifacial PV cells,
    in addition to the requirements described in IEC 60904-1 and differentiating from
    IEC TS 60904-1-2 which is more applicable to encapsulated PV device. Specific
    requirements on bifacial reference cells and calibration of solar simulators are
    also defined to provide useful guidance for the proposed methods."
