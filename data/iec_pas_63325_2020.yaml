abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 63325:2020 provides requirements and guidance on the ensurance
    and assurance of functional safety and security in different stages of the lifecycle.
    It will help to coordinate risk assessment, design and management and operation
    processes, avoiding conflicts between functional safety and security.<br />\r\nThis
    PAS does not aim to give some completely new lifecycle, but based on the functional
    safety lifecycle, security lifecycle and other state of the art engineering processes,
    it aims to provide requirements and suggestions in some typical stages to achieve
    coordination between functional safety and security.<br />\r\nThe objective of
    this PAS is Industry Automation Control System (IACS), including Equipment Under
    Control (EUC) system and safety-related system."
