abstract:
- content: "IEC 60502-4:2023 specifies the test requirements for type testing of accessories
    for power cables with rated voltages from 3,6/6 (7,2) kV up to 18/30 (36) kV,
    complying with IEC 60502â€‘2 or other relevant cable standards.<br />\r\nAccessories
    for special applications, such as aerial cables, submarine or ship cables or hazardous
    situations (explosive environments, fire-resistant cables or seismic conditions),
    are not included.<br />\r\nIt is not necessary to repeat these tests, once successfully
    completed, unless changes are made in the materials, design or manufacturing process
    which can affect the performance characteristics.<br />\r\nTest methods are included
    in IEC 61442."
