abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62607-4-4:2016(E), which is a Technical Specification, provides
    a measurement method for thermal runaway quality level test for nano-enabled energy
    storage devices. This method uses comparative measurement to enable a manufacturer
    to decide whether or not the nanomaterial additives used in energy storage devices
    are resilient against the thermal runaway caused by a faulty or accidental low
    resistance connection between two or several internal points depending on the
    number of stacking electrode layers of the test sample. The nanomaterial additives
    may mix with the materials of positive and negative electrodes, electrolyte, coated
    on electrodes or separator. This document includes definitions of terminology,
    test sample, puncture nail requirements, test procedures, data analysis and methods
    of interpretation of results and a case study. This document does not apply directly
    to the safety testing for energy storage device products due to complex safety
    design schemes embedded in these products.
