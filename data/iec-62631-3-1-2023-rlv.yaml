  content: "IEC 62631-3-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62631-3-1:2023
    specifies a method of test for the determination of volume resistance and volume
    resistivity of electrical insulating materials by applying a DC voltage. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- following the withdrawal of IEC 60093 and its partial
    replacement with the first edition of IEC 62631-3-1, the missing editorial and
    technical texts have been added and incorporated into this second edition of IEC
    62631-3-1;<br />\r\n- the alignment of normative texts and informative notes have
    been addressed as well as the normative references and bibliography."
