  content: "IEC 61788-23:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61788-23:2021
    addresses a test method for the determination of the residual resistance ratio
    (RRR), rRRR, of cavity-grade niobium. This method is intended for high-purity
    niobium grades with 150 < rRRR < 600. The test method is valid for specimens with
    rectangular or round cross-section, cross-sectional area greater than 1 mm2 but
    less than 20 mm2, and a length not less than 10 nor more than 25 times the width
    or diameter."
