abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 62809:2019 is available as IEC TR 62809:2019 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    TR 62809:2019 provides an overview of the requirements and tests of IEC 60601-2-66
    in combination with the applicable sections of IEC 60601-1, and the collateral
    standards of the IEC 60601 series. It is intended to assist various groups involved
    in the product lifecycles process - like designers and suppliers - to get an overview
    of the basic requirements without studying all involved standard documents in
    detail. The table includes not all but just the more common requirements and tests.
    It is crucial to understand that the summary in this document cannot serve as
    an input for a product requirement specification or as a test plan without consulting
    IEC 60601-2-66 itself. This document alone cannot be used to establish or assess
    compliance to IEC 60601-2-66."
