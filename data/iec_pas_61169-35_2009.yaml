abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 61169-35:2009(E) is a sectional specification providing information
    and rules for preparation of detail specification of 2,92 series R.F coaxial connectors
    together with the pro forma blank detail specification. 2,92 series coaxial connectors
    with characteristic impedance 50 ohm, 2,92 mm inner diameter of outer conductor
    and screw coupling, are used for millimeter wave applications, connecting with
    RF cables or microstrips. The operating frequency limit is up to 40 GHz.
