abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19755:2003 specifies a feature for finalizing objects in COBOL.
    The specification is a Type 2 Technical Report so that implementations can be
    undertaken on an experimental basis. The experience gained is expected to result
    in an improved specification that can progress to standardization.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    purpose of object finalization is to free resources that will not otherwise be
    freed by the normal garbage collection process. Examples include files that are
    open, temporary work files, database connections, TCP/IP socket interfaces and
    network connections."
