abstract:
- content: "IEC 60068-3-3:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60068-3-3:2019
    applies primarily to electro-technical equipment but its application can be extended
    to other equipment and to components. In addition, if some type of analysis is
    always performed when making a seismic qualification, for example for the choice
    of the representative sample to be tested or for the extension of the seismic
    qualification from the tested specimen to similar specimens, the verification
    of the performance of an equipment by analysis or by a combination of testing
    and analysis can be acceptable but is outside the scope of this document, which
    is restricted to verification based entirely upon data from dynamic testing. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1991. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    the main aim of this revision is to connect the testing level to the seismic activity
    level of the zone where the equipment could be installed;<br />\r\n- a standard
    shape for the required response spectrum is also given for the general seismic
    class for which the seismic environment is either not known or is imprecisely
    known;<br />\r\n- Clauses 11 to 15 were renumbered and some adjustments were made
    as their content is very general and the requirements can be applied both to the
    general seismic class and to the specific seismic class;<br />\r\n- the word “envelope”
    is replaced with “dominance” and “to envelop” with “to dominate” in order to provide
    a more precise meaning from a mathematical point of view.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of September 2021 have been included in this copy."
