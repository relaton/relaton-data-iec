- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IEC 61850-7-4:2010+A1:2020 specifies the information model of devices
    and functions generally related to common use regarding applications in systems
    for power utility automation. It also contains the information model of devices
    and function-related applications in substations. In particular, it specifies
    the compatible logical node names and data object names for communication between
    intelligent electronic devices (IED). This includes the relationship between logical
    nodes and data objects. Major technical changes with regard to the previous edition
    are as follows:<br />\r\n- corrections and clarifications according to technical
    issues raised by the users' community; extensions for new logical nodes for the
    power quality domain;<br />\r\n- extensions for the model for statistical and
    historical statistical data;<br />\r\n- extensions regarding IEC 61850-90-1;<br
    />\r\n- extensions for new logical nodes for monitoring functions according to
    IEC 62271;<br />\r\n- new logical nodes from IEC 61850-7-410 and IEC 61850-7-420
    of general interest.<br />\r\nThis publication is of core relevance for Smart
    Grid. This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2010) and its
    amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
    publication."
