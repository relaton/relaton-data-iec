  content: "IEC 60947-5-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60947-5-1:2016 applies
    to control circuit devices and switching elements intended for controlling, signalling,
    interlocking, etc., of switchgear and controlgear. It applies to control circuit
    devices having a rated voltage not exceeding 1 000 V a.c. (at a frequency not
    exceeding 1 000 Hz) or 600 V d.c. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the
    third edition published in 2003 and its Amendment 1:2009. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update of normative
    references;<br />\r\nb) update and restructuration of subclauses in 7.1;<br />\r\nc)
    addition of material requirements and test;<br />\r\nd) udpate of EMC requirements;<br
    />\r\ne) clarification of requirements and update of 8.2;<br />\r\nf) addition
    of requirements for screwless-type clamping units;<br />\r\ng) udpate of existing
    Tables 4 and 5;<br />\r\nh) addition of new Tables 6, 7, 8 and 9;<br />\r\ni)
    addition of a new Figure 10 ;<br />\r\nj) addition of a new Annex N.<br />\r\nThis
