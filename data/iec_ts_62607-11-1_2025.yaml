abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-11-1:2025, which is a Technical Specification, provides a
    standardized method for measuring shielding effectiveness on nanomaterials including
    carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in the near-field region. This document provides:<br />\r\n-
    recommendations for sample preparation,<br />\r\n- outlines of the experimental
    procedures to measure shielding effectiveness of CNTs in thin films,<br />\r\n-
    methods of interpretation of results and discussion of data analysis, and<br />\r\n-
    case studies."
