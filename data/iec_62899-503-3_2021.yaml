abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-503-3:2021(E) specifies a measuring method of contact resistance
    for printed thin film transistors (TFTs) by the transfer length method (TLM).
    The method requires the fabrication of a test element group (TEG) with varying
    channel length (L) between source and drain electrodes. The method is intended
    for quality assessment of TFT electrode contacts and is suited for determining
    whether the contact resistance lies within a desired range.
