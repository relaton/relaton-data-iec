  content: "IEC 62149-3:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62149-3:2020 covers
    the performance specification for electroabsorption (EA) type optical modulators
    monolithically integrated with laser diodes for 40 Gbit/s fibre optic transmission
    systems. This document contains a definition of the product performance requirements
    together with a series of sets of tests and measurements with clearly defined
    conditions, severities and pass/fail criteria. The tests are intended to be run
    as an initial design verification to prove any product's ability to satisfy this
    document's requirements. This document is applicable for on-off keying format.
    A product that has been shown to meet all the requirements of a performance standard
    can be declared as compliant with the performance standard but will then be controlled
    by a quality assurance program. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2014 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    updates of the title, scope, normative references and performance test tables.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of February 2021 have been included in this
    copy.</p>"
