abstract:
- content: "This Technical Report, which is informative in its nature, provides guidance
    on principles which can be used as the basis for determining the requirements
    for the connection of distorting installations to MV, HV and EHV public power
    systems (LV installations are covered in other IEC documents). For the purposes
    of this report, a distorting installation means an installation (which may be
    a load or a generator) that produces harmonics and/or interharmonics. The primary
    objective is to provide guidance to system operators or owners on engineering
    practices, which will facilitate the provision of adequate service quality for
    all connected customers. In addressing installations, this document is not intended
    to replace equipment standards for emission limits. The report addresses the allocation
    of the capacity of the system to absorb disturbances. It does not address how
    to mitigate disturbances, nor does it address how the capacity of the system can
    be increased. Since the guidelines outlined in this report are necessarily based
    on certain simplifying assumptions, there is no guarantee that this approach will
    always provide the optimum solution for all harmonic situations. The recommended
    approach should be used with flexibility and judgment as far as engineering is
    concerned, when applying the given assessment procedures in full or in part. The
    system operator or owner is responsible for specifying requirements for the connection
    of distorting installations to the system. The distorting installation is to be
    understood as the customer's complete installation (i.e. including distorting
    and non-distorting parts). Problems related to harmonics fall into two basic categories:<br
    />\r\n/ - Harmonic currents that are injected into the supply system by converters
    and harmonic sources, giving rise to harmonic voltages in the system. Both harmonic
    currents and resulting voltages can be considered as conducted phenomena.<br />\r\n-
    Harmonic currents that induce interference into communication systems. This phenomenon
    is more pronounced at higher order harmonic frequencies because of increased coupling
    between the circuits and because of the higher sensitivity of the communication
    circuits in the audible range.<br />\r\nThis report gives guidance for the co-ordination
    of the harmonic voltages between different voltage levels in order to meet the
    compatibility levels at the point of utilisation. The recommendations in this
    report do not address harmonic interference phenomena in communication circuits
    (i.e. only the first of the above categories is addressed). This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1996 and constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition is significantly more streamlined than first edition, and
    it reflects the experiences gained in the application of the first edition. As
    part of this streamlining process, this second edition of IEC/TR 61000-3-6 does
    not address communications circuit interference. Clause 9 on this (section 10)
    was removed, as this did not suitably address emission limits for telephone interference.
    The scope has been adjusted to point out that IEC/TR 61000-3-6 does not address
    communications circuit interference. This edition has also been harmonised with
    IEC/TR 61000-3-7 and IEC/TR 61000-3-13. This Technical Report has the status of
    a basic EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide 107."
