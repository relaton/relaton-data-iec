abstract:
- content: "IEC 60238:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60238:2016 applies
    to lampholders with Edison thread E14, E27 and E40, designed for connection to
    the supply of lamps and semi-luminaires only. It also applies to switched-lampholders
    for use in AC circuits only, where the working voltage does not exceed 250 V r.m.s.
    This ninth edition cancels and replaces the eighth edition published in 2004,
    Amendment 1: 2008 and Amendment 2:2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Addition of a pull test for certain E5 and
    E10 lampholders.<br />\r\nb) Annex D listing amended requirements/clauses which
    require products to be retested."
