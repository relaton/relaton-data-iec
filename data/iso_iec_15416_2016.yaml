abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15416:2016:</p><p>- specifies the methodology for the measurement
    of specific attributes of bar code symbols;</p><p>- defines a method for evaluating
    these measurements and deriving an overall assessment of symbol quality; and</p><p>-
    provides information on possible causes of deviation from optimum grades to assist
    users in taking appropriate corrective action.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15416:2016 applies
    to those symbologies for which a reference decode algorithm has been defined,
    and which are intended to be read using linear scanning methods, but its methodology
    can be applied partially or wholly to other symbologies.</p>"
