abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9075-10:2023 speciﬁes embedded SQL for the programming languages:
    Ada, C, COBOL, Fortran, MUMPS, Pascal, and PL/I. ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016 deﬁnes similar
    features of Database language SQL that support embedding of SQL-statements into
    programs written in the Java? programming language (Java is a registered trademark
    of Sun Microsystems, Inc.). The embedding of SQL into Java is commonly known as
    \"SQLJ\". This part of ISO/IEC 9075 speciﬁes the syntax and semantics of SQLJ,
    as well as mechanisms to ensure binary portability of resulting SQLJ applications.
    In addition, it speciﬁes a number of Java packages and their contained classes
    (including methods).<br />\r\nThroughout ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016, the terms \"SQLJ\"
    and \"SQL/OLB\" are used synonymously.<br />\r\nNOTE Additional explanatory material
    (non-normative) about certain facilities defined in ISO/IEC 9075-2 can be found
    in ISO/IEC TR 19075-3."
