abstract:
- content: "IEC 61730-2:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61730-2:2023
    lists the tests a PV module is required to fulfil for safety qualification. This
    document applies for safety qualification only in conjunction with IEC 61730-1.
    The objective of this document is to provide the testing sequence intended to
    verify the safety of PV modules whose construction has been assessed by IEC 61730-1.
    The test sequence and pass criteria are designed to detect the potential breakdown
    of internal and external components of PV modules that would result in fire, electric
    shock, and/or personal injury. This document defines the basic safety test requirements
    and additional tests that are a function of the PV module end-use applications.
    The additional testing requirements outlined in relevant ISO documents, or the
    national or local codes which govern the installation and use of these PV modules
    in their intended locations, are considered in addition to the requirements contained
    within this document.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2024-10) has
    been included in this copy."
