  content: "IEC TS 61400-3-2:2019 specifies additional requirements for assessment
    of the external conditions at a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) site and
    specifies essential design requirements to ensure the engineering integrity of
    FOWTs. Its purpose is to provide an appropriate level of protection against damage
    from all hazards during the planned lifetime.<br />\r\nThis document focuses on
    the engineering integrity of the structural components of a FOWT but is also concerned
    with subsystems such as control and protection mechanisms, internal electrical
    systems and mechanical systems.<br />\r\nA wind turbine is considered as a FOWT
    if the floating substructure is subject to hydrodynamic loading and supported
    by buoyancy and a station-keeping system. A FOWT encompasses five principal subsystems:
    the RNA, the tower, the floating substructure, the station-keeping system and
    the on-board machinery, equipment and systems that are not part of the RNA.<br
    />\r\nThe following types of floating substructures are explicitly considered
    within the context of this document:<br />\r\na) ship-shaped structures and barges,<br
    />\r\nb) semi-submersibles (Semi),<br />\r\nc) spar buoys (Spar),<br />\r\nd)
    tension-leg platforms/buoys (TLP / TLB).<br />\r\nIn addition to the structural
    types listed above, this document generally covers other floating platforms intended
    to support wind turbines. These other structures can have a great range of variability
    in geometry and structural forms and, therefore, can be only partly covered by
    the requirements of this document. In other cases, specific requirements stated
    in this document can be found not to apply to all or part of a structure under
    design. In all the above cases, conformity with this document will require that
    the design is based upon its underpinning principles and achieves a level of safety
    equivalent, or superior, to the level implicit in it.<br />\r\nThis document is
    applicable to unmanned floating structures with one single horizontal axis turbine.
    Additional considerations might be needed for multi-turbine units on a single
    floating substructure, vertical-axis wind turbines, or combined wind/wave energy
    systems.<br />\r\nThis document is to be used together with the appropriate IEC
    and ISO standards mentioned in Clause 2. In particular, this document is intended
    to be fully consistent with the requirements of IEC 61400-1 and IEC 61400-3-1.
    The safety level of the FOWT designed according to this document is to be at or
    exceed the level inherent in IEC 61400‑1 and IEC 61400-3-1."
