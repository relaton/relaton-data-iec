  content: "IEC 61439-4:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 61439-4:2023 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 61439-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61439-4:2023 defines the specific
    requirements of ACS as follows:<br />\r\n- assemblies for which the rated voltage
    does not exceed 1 000 V in case of AC or 1 500 V in case of DC;<br />\r\n- assemblies
    where the nominal primary voltage and the nominal secondary voltage of transformers
    incorporated in ACS are within the limits specified above;<br />\r\n- assemblies
    intended for use on construction sites, both indoors and outdoors, i.e. temporary
    places of work to which the public do not generally have access and where building
    construction, installation, repairs, alteration or demolition of property (buildings)
    or civil engineering (public works) or excavation or any other similar operations
    are carried out;<br />\r\n- transportable (semi-fixed) or mobile ASSEMBLIES with
    enclosure.<br />\r\nThis second edition of IEC 61439-4 cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
