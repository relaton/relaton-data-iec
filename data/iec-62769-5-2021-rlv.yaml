  content: "IEC 62769-5:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62769-5:2021
    defines the FDI Information Model. One of the main tasks of the Information Model
    is to reflect the topology of the automation system. Therefore, it represents
    the devices of the automation system as well as the connecting communication networks
    including their properties, relationships, and the operations that can be performed
    on them. The types in the AddressSpace of the FDI Server constitute a catalogue,
    which is built from FDI Packages. The fundamental types for the FDI Information
    Model are well defined in OPC UA for Devices (IEC 62541-100). The FDI Information
    Model specifies extensions for a few special cases and otherwise explains how
    these types are used and how the contents are built from elements of DevicePackages.
    The overall FDI architecture is illustrated in Figure 1. The architectural components
    that are within the scope of this document have been highlighted in this illustration."
