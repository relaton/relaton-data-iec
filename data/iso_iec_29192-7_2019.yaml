abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29192-7:2019 This document specifies broadcast authentication protocols,
    which are protocols that provide data integrity and entity authentication in a
    broadcast setting, i.e. a setting with one sender transmitting messages to many
    receivers. To provide entity authentication, there needs to be a pre-existing
    infrastructure which links the sender to a cryptographic secret. The establishment
    of such an infrastructure is beyond the scope of this document.
