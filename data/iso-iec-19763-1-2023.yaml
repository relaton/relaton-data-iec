    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document provides an overview of the whole ISO/IEC 19763 series. This overview includes the purpose, the underlying concepts, the overall architecture and the requirements for the development of other standards within the 19763 series.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Collectively, the other parts of the ISO/IEC 19763 series provide a set of normative metamodels to enable the registration of many different types of model. Each of these metamodels is expressed both as a UML class diagram and, more formally, in text. The metamodels, along with the specification in ISO/IEC 11179-3, define the information about the models that is to be registered. The models themselves can be stored in a model repository or can just exist as paper documents.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The ISO/IEC 19763 series does not specify any physical structure of a registry where model information is to be recorded.</span></p>
