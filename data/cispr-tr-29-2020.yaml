  content: "<!-- NEW! -->CISPR TR 29:2020, which is a technical report, describes
    the algorithms used for objective picture assessment in immunity tests of analogue
    and digital TV broadcast receivers and associated equipment. The algorithms used
    were developed on the basis of the specifications originally included in Annex
    K of CISPR 20:2002/AMD2:2004, the later edition of which has been replaced by
    CISPR 35:2016. The method of objective picture assessment described in that annex
    employs the same interference mechanism and is based on the same wanted signal
    definition as specified in CISPR 35 for subjective picture assessment. Objective
    picture assessment, therefore, constitutes an alternative to the subjective method
    and offers the advantage of direct correlation to the subjective method. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2004. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    update of the references, and<br />\r\n- editorial improvements."
