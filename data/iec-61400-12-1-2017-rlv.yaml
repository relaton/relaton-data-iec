  content: "IEC 61400-12-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61400-12-1:2017
    specifies a procedure for measuring the power performance characteristics of a
    single wind turbine and applies to the testing of wind turbines of all types and
    sizes connected to the electrical power network. In addition, this standard describes
    a procedure to be used to determine the power performance characteristics of small
    wind turbines (as defined in IEC 61400-2) when connected to either the electric
    power network or a battery bank. The procedure can be used for performance evaluation
    of specific wind turbines at specific locations, but equally the methodology can
    be used to make generic comparisons between different wind turbine models or different
    wind turbine settings when site-specific conditions and data filtering influences
    are taken into account. This new edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition: new definition of wind speed, inclusion
    of wind shear and wind veer, revision of air density correction, revision of site
    calibration, revision to definition of power curve, interpolation to bin centre
    method, revision of obstacle model, etc.<br />\r\nKey words: Wind turbines, Wind
    energy, renewable energy, performance, efficiency<br />\r\nThe contents of the
    corrigendum of September 2019, March 2020 and May 2021 have been included in this
    copy."
