abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 is the first of a series of publications that
    explore IP-based enterprise communication involving Corporate telecommunication
    Networks (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation
    Corporate Networks (NGCN). The series particularly focuses on inter-domain communication,
    including communication between parts of the same enterprise, between enterprises
    and between enterprises and carriers. ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 provides general information
    on the subject, defines some architectural concepts, identifies various communication
    scenarios, and provides a framework in support of other publications that provide
    greater detail on particular topics.</p><p>The scope of ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009
    is limited to communications with a real-time element, including voice, video,
    real-time text and instant messaging.</p>"
