abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 12860:2009 is the first of a series of publications that explore IP-based enterprise
    communication involving Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs) (also known
    as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN).
    The series particularly focuses on inter-domain communication, including communication
    between parts of the same enterprise, between enterprises and between enterprises
    and carriers. ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 provides general information on the subject,
    defines some architectural concepts, identifies various communication scenarios,
    and provides a framework in support of other publications that provide greater
    detail on particular topics.<br />\r\nThe scope of ISO/IEC TR 12860:2009 is limited
    to communications with a real-time element, including voice, video, real-time
    text and instant messaging."
