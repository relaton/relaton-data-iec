abstract:
- content: "This document defines quality measures useful for requirements and evaluation
    of IT service quality in terms of characteristics and sub-characteristics defined
    in ISO/IEC TS 25011.<br />\r\nThis document contains a basic set of quality measures
    for each characteristic and sub-characteristic.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    assign ranges of values of the quality measures to rated levels or to grades of
    compliance. Such values are defined based on the nature of the IT service, and
    so depends on factors such as category of the IT service or users' needs. Some
    attributes can have a desirable range of values, which does not depend on specific
    user needs but generic factors, for example, service downtime. This document includes,
    in Annex A, considerations for the selection and application of quality measures.<br
    />\r\nThe quality measures in this document are primarily intended to be used
    for quality evaluation and improvement of IT services during or after the development
    life cycle.<br />\r\nThe main users of this document are people carrying out quality
    requirements specification and evaluation activities for IT services as part of
    the following:<br />\r\n- development: including requirements analysis, design,
    implementation, testing and deployment during the development life cycle;<br />\r\n-
    quality management: monitoring activities of quality assurance and performing
    quality control of an IT service;<br />\r\n- supply: making a contract with the
    user for supplying an IT service under the terms of a contract;<br />\r\n- acquisition:
    including IT service selection, when acquiring or procuring an IT service from
    a service provider;<br />\r\n- maintenance: improvement of an IT service based
    on quality measurement.<br />\r\nThe relationship of this document to domain-specific
    IT service quality model and its precedence over this document is determined by
    the user in a specific context of use."
