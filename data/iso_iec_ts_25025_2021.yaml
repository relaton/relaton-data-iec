abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines quality measures useful for requirements and
    evaluation of IT service quality in terms of characteristics and sub-characteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC TS 25011.</p><p>This document contains a basic set of quality
    measures for each characteristic and sub-characteristic.</p><p>This document does
    not assign ranges of values of the quality measures to rated levels or to grades
    of compliance. Such values are defined based on the nature of the IT service,
    and so depends on factors such as category of the IT service or users' needs.
    Some attributes can have a desirable range of values, which does not depend on
    specific user needs but generic factors, for example, service downtime. This document
    includes, in Annex A, considerations for the selection and application of quality
    measures.</p><p>The quality measures in this document are primarily intended to
    be used for quality evaluation and improvement of IT services during or after
    the development life cycle.</p><p>The main users of this document are people carrying
    out quality requirements specification and evaluation activities for IT services
    as part of the following:</p><p>— development: including requirements analysis,
    design, implementation, testing and deployment during the development life cycle;</p><p>—
    quality management: monitoring activities of quality assurance and performing
    quality control of an IT service;</p><p>— supply: making a contract with the user
    for supplying an IT service under the terms of a contract;</p><p>— acquisition:
    including IT service selection, when acquiring or procuring an IT service from
    a service provider;</p><p>— maintenance: improvement of an IT service based on
    quality measurement.</p><p>The relationship of this document to domain-specific
    IT service quality model and its precedence over this document is determined by
    the user in a specific context of use.</p><p><strong></strong></p>"
