abstract:
- content: "The ISO/IEC 10373 series defines test methods for characteristics of identification
    cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced
    to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the
    supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed
    in identification card applications.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Criteria for acceptability
    do not form part of the ISO/IEC 10373 series, but can be found in the International
    Standards mentioned above.<br />\r\nThis document defines test methods which are
    specific to proximity cards and objects, proximity coupling devices and proximity
    extended devices, defined in ISO/IEC 14443‑1, ISO/IEC 14443‑2, ISO/IEC 14443‑3
    and ISO/IEC 14443‑4.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Test methods defined in this document are
    intended to be performed separately. A given proximity card or object, proximity
    coupling device or proximity extended device, is not required to pass through
    all the tests sequentially.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 10373‑1 defines test methods which
    are common to one or more integrated circuit card technologies and other parts
    in the ISO/IEC 10373 series deal with other technology‑specific tests.<br />\r\nThe
    conformance test plan defined in Annex O specifies the list of tests applicable
    for each part of the ISO/IEC 14443 series."
