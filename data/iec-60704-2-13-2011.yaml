  content: "IEC 60704-2-13:2011(E) applies to electrical range hoods for household
    and similar use intended for filtering the air of a room or for exhausting the
    air out of a room, including their accessories and their component parts. It also
    applies to range hoods with an external fan which may be mounted inside or outside
    of the room where the range hood is located. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition (2000) and constitutes an adaptation to the third edition of
    IEC 60704-1 (2010). This Part 2-13 is intended to be used in conjunction with
    IEC 60704-1:2010 (3rd edition) Household and similar electrical appliances - Test
    code for the determination of airborne acoustical noise - Part 1: General requirements.
    This Part 2-13 supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 60704-1,
    so as to establish the test code for range hoods. When a particular subclause
    of Part 1 is not mentioned in this Part 2-13, that subclause is applicable as
    far as reasonable. Where this standard states \"addition\", \"modification\" or
    \"replacement\", the relevant requirements, test specifications or explanatory
    matter in Part 1 is to be adapted accordingly. Subclauses, tables and figures
    that are numbered starting from 101 are additional to those in Part 1. Unless
    notes are in a new subclause or involve notes in Part 1, they are numbered starting
    from 101, including those in a replaced clause or subclause. Additional annexes
    are lettered AA, BB, etc.<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction
    with This publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/2991\">IEC
