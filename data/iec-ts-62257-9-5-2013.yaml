  content: "IEC/TS 62257-9-5:2013(E) applies to stand-alone rechargeable electric
    lighting appliances or kits that can be installed by a typical user without employing
    a technician. This technical specification presents a quality assurance framework
    that includes product specifications (a framework for interpreting test results),
    test methods, and standardized specifications sheets (templates for communicating
    test results). The intended users of this technical specification are:<br />\r\n-
    market support programmes;<br />\r\n- manufacturers and distributors;<br />\r\n-
    bulk procurement programmes;<br />\r\n- trade regulators. The main changes with
    respect to the first edition are:<br />\r\n- overall, shifted from narrow focus
    on the needs of bulk procurement programmes to a wider framework for structuring
    quality assurance using appropriate methods for a range of stakeholders including
    governments, manufacturers, buyers, and others;<br />\r\n- revised structure of
    document with modular methods (located in annexes) that are applied using four
    distinct test regimes;<br />\r\n- added a framework for categorizing products
    based on the arrangement of components.\r\n\r\n<br /><br />This publication is
    to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/20376\">IEC/TS
