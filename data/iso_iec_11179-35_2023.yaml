abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11179-35:2023 This document provides a specification for an extension
    to a Metadata Registry (MDR), as specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3, in which metadata
    that describes models, and their associated metamodels, can be registered.<br
    />\r\nThe specification in this document, together with the relevant clauses of
    the specification in ISO/IEC 11179-3, provides the ability to record metadata
    about:<br />\r\na) models used in software engineering or information processing,
    for example, information or data models, process models, models of web services
    or any other type of models used to develop software systems or the processing
    of information;<br />\r\nb) the concepts associated with the various elements
    within the models;<br />\r\nc) the metamodels associated with the models;<br />\r\nd)
    the mappings identified between the models, between the metamodels, and between
    the models and their associated metamodels â€“ this is achieved by using the mapping
    facilities specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to the formulation of models and metamodels to be shared among people and machines,
    independent of the organization that produces the model or metamodel. It is not
    applicable to the physical instantiation of any model."
