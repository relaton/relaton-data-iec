  content: "IEC 62595-2-1:2016(E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measuring methods for determining the electrical and optical parameters of LED
    backlight units for liquid crystal displays. This first edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition of IEC 62595-2 published in 2012. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) changed the series title
    in order to cover frontlight unit;<br />\r\nb) added the detailed measurement
    procedures particularly for block-wise BLU;<br />\r\nc) deleted Annex A;<br />\r\nd)
    revised Figure 1 and Figure 2 and some editorial errors."
