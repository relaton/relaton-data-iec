abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15940:2006 defines the software engineering environment (SEE) services
    conceptually in a reference model that can be adapted to any SEEs to automate
    one or more software engineering activities.It describes services that support
    the process definitions as in ISO/IEC 12207 so that the set of SEE Services are
    compatible with ISO/IEC 12207.ISO/IEC 15940:2006 can be used either as a general
    reference, or to define an automated software process.
