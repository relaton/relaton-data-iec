  content: "IEC 60688:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60688:2021
    applies to transducers with electrical inputs and outputs for making measurements
    of AC or DC electrical quantities. The output signal can be in the form of an
    analogue direct current, an analog direct voltage or in digital form.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to measuring transducers used for converting electrical quantities
    such as<br />\r\n– current,<br />\r\n– voltage,<br />\r\n– active power,<br />\r\n–
    reactive power,<br />\r\n– power factor,<br />\r\n– phase angle,<br />\r\n– frequency,<br
    />\r\n– harmonics or total harmonic distortion, and<br />\r\n– apparent power<br
    />\r\nto an output signal.<br />\r\nThis document is not applicable for<br />\r\n–
    instrument transformers that complies with IEC 61869 (all parts),<br />\r\n– transmitters
    for use in industrial process application that complies with IEC 60770 (all parts),
    and<br />\r\n– performance measuring and monitoring devices (PMD) that comply
    with IEC 61557 12:2018.<br />\r\nWithin the measuring range, the output signal
    is a function of the measurand. An auxiliary supply can be needed.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies<br />\r\na) if the nominal frequency of the input(s) lies between
    0 Hz and 1 500 Hz,<br />\r\nb) to the electrical measuring transducer if it is
    part of a system for the measurement of a non-electrical quantity, and if it otherwise
    falls within the scope of this document, and<br />\r\nc) to transducers for use
    in a variety of applications such as telemetry and process control and in one
    of a number of defined environments.<br />\r\nThis document is intended:<br />\r\n–
    to specify the terminology and definitions relating to transducers whose main
    application is in industry,<br />\r\n– to unify the test methods used in evaluating
    transducer performance, and<br />\r\n– to specify accuracy limits and output values
    for transducers.<br />\r\nIEC 60688:2021 cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) updating normative references;<br />\r\nb) additional
    requirements for specific transducers used for LV monitoring applications;<br
    />\r\nc) creation of interface coding to ease selection by the end-user."
