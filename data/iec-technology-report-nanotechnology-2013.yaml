  content: "Nanotechnology brings significant benefits to energy storage and the overall
    solar energy sector for example in terms of improved materials’ efficiency and
    reduced manufacturing costs. Concretely, battery storage capacity could be increased,
    solar cells could be produced cheaper and their lifetime extended.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis Technology Report outlines a whole range of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies,
    evaluating their role in addressing the energy challenge. Notably, it discusses
    their potential contribution to the successful integration of renewable energy
    and energy storage.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe publication is intended for manufacturers
    of products for energy generation and storage as well as for energy regulators.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Technology Report was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy
    Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>) together with the Fraunhofer
    Institute for Systems and Innovation Research ISI.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis Technology
    Report is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/nanotechnology-sectors-solar-energy-and-energy-storage\">free
