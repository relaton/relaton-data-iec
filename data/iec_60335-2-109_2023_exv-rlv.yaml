abstract:
- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-109:2023 EXV and IEC 60335-2-109:2023 RLV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-109:2023 deals with the safety of UV radiation water treatment
    appliances for household and similar use, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances. Appliances not
    intended for normal household use but that nevertheless can be a source of danger
    to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops and in
    light industry and farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- pumps (IEC 60335-2-41);<br />\r\n- luminaires
    for aquariums (IEC 60598-2-11);<br />\r\n- luminaires for swimming pools and similar
    applications (IEC 60598-2-18);<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for
    professional use;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where
    special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2010, Amendment 1:2013 and Amendment 2:2016. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) modification or conversion of some
    notes to normative text (Clause 1, 6.2, 22.102);<br />\r\nc) introduction of IEC
    60417 symbol for maximum operating depth (7.1, 7.6, 7.12.1);<br />\r\nd) addition
    of external accessible surface temperature limits (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ne) clarification
    of requirements for remote operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51);<br />\r\nf) the requirements
    to emit harmful radiation are deleted, because they are covered in Part 1 (Clause
    32).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
