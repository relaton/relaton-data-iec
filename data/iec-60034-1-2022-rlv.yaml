  content: "IEC 60034-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-1:2022
    is applicable to all rotating electrical machines, except rotating electrical
    machines for rail and road vehicles, which are covered by the IEC 60349 series
    of standards. Machines within the scope of this document may also be subject to
    superseding, modifying or additional requirements in other standards, for example,
    IEC 60079 and IEC 60092. This fourteenth edition cancels and replaces the thirteenth
    edition published in 2017."
