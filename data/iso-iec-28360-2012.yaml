    <p>ISO/IEC 28360:2012 specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from information and communication technology (ICT) and consumer electronics (CE) equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC).</p>
    <p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 28360:2012 includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PCs. It also specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables (e.g. paper).</p>
