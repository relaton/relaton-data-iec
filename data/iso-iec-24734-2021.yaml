    <p>This document specifies a method for measuring the digital printing productivity of digital printing devices with various office applications and print job characteristics. This document is applicable to digital printing devices, including single-function and multi-function devices, regardless of print technology (e.g. inkjet, laser). Devices can be equipped with a range of paper feed and finishing options either directly connected to the computer system or via a network. It is intended to be used for black and white (B&amp;W) as well as colour digital printing devices. It allows for the comparison of the productivity of machines operating in various available modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, etc.) and office applications when the test system environment, operating modes, and job mix for each machine are held identical. This document includes test files, test setup procedure, test runtime procedure, and the reporting requirements for the digital printing productivity measurements.</p>
    <p>This document is not intended to be used for devices which are not able to print on a media size of A4/8,5” × 11” or for devices which are not able to collate multiple copies of a print.</p>
    <p>This document is not intended to replace manufacturer's rated speeds.</p>
