  content: "IEC TR 63259:2022(E) provides guidelines for the application of water
    cooling systems for power electronics used in electrical transmission and distribution
    systems.<br />\r\nThis document describes a kind of water cooling system, in which
    de-ionized water or de-ionized water mixed with other solutes is used as the heat
    transfer agent for the removal of heat from power electronic equipment. Water
    cooling system can be separated into main circuit, and control and protection
    system. Other cooling systems, in which de-ionized water is not the heat transfer
    agent, are excluded in this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance
    and supporting information for both purchaser(s) and potential supplier(s). It
    can be used as the basis for drafting a procurement specification and as a guide
    during project implementation."
