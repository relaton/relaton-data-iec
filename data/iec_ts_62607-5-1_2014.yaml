abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62607-5-1:2014(E) provides a standardized sample structure for characterizing
    charge transport properties in thin-film organic/nano electronic devices and a
    format to report details of the structure which shall be provided with the measurement
    results. The standardized OTFT testing structure with a contact-area-limited doping
    can mitigate contact resistance and enable reliable measurement of the charge
    carrier mobility. The purpose of this Technical Specification is to provide test
    sample structures for determining the intrinsic charge transport properties of
    organic thin-film devices. The intention is to provide reliable materials information
    for OTFTs and to set guidelines for making test sample structures so that materials
    information is clear and consistent throughout the research community and industry.
