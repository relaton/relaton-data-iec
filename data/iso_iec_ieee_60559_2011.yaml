abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011(E) specifies formats and methods for floating-point
    arithmetic in computer systems - standard and extended functions with single,
    double, extended, and extendable precision - and recommends formats for data interchange.
    Exception conditions are defined and standard handling of these conditions is
    specified. It provides a method for computation with floating-point numbers that
    will yield the same result whether the processing is done in hardware, software,
    or a combination of the two. The results of the computation will be identical,
    independent of implementation, given the same input data. Errors, and error conditions,
    in the mathematical processing will be reported in a consistent manner regardless
    of implementation. This first edition, published as ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559, replaces
    the second edition of IEC 60559.
