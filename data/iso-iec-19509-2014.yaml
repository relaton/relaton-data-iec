    <p>ISO/IEC 19509:2014 supports the Meta Object Facility (MOF) Core defined in ISO/IEC 19508. MOF is the foundation technology for describing metamodels. It covers a wide range of domains, and is based on a constrained subset of UML. XMI is widely used XML interchange format. It defines the following aspects involved in describing objects in XML:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the representation of objects in terms of XML elements and attributes;</li>
    <li>the standard mechanisms to link objects within the same file or across files;</li>
    <li>the validation of XMI documents using XML Schemas;</li>
    <li>object identity, which allows objects to be referenced from other objects in terms of IDs and UUIDs.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>XMI describes solutions to the above issues by specifying EBNF production rules to create XML documents and Schemas that share objects consistently.</p>
