  content: "Over 130 countries around the world have committed to a goal of net zero
    carbon emissions. This challenge has profound implications for the electrical
    power system of a nation which will need to eliminate its carbon emissions as
    well as add carbon-free capacity to meet new electrical demands. It will entail
    immense effort from a broad range of stakeholders involved in the areas of policy
    and law, regulation, standardization, and technology.<br />\r\nTo ensure that
    energy systems, platforms, devices and markets can transition and work effectively
    in a zero carbon power system, standards have a critical role to play. They will
    need to ensure interoperability, maintain a minimum level of performance and safety,
    and help guide the transition towards new technologies and operating regimes.
    While a range of standards exist today that are relevant to the zero carbon vision,
    a zero carbon power system will require a broad range of new standards to ensure
    reliable, efficient and resilient system operation.<br />\r\nGiven the breadth
    of change and technical challenges to achieve a zero carbon future, standards
    have a key role to play in the evolution of the power system, and in facilitating
    the transition. This white paper considers the challenge of decarbonizing the
    power system, the resulting required transition ahead, and what this may mean
    for the IEC, its members and its standards.<br />\r\nThis white paper has been
    prepared by a project team representing a variety of organizations, working under
    the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>). The
    project team included representatives from electrical power network businesses,
    standards organizations, and equipment vendors from around the world. Dr Jianbin
    Fan, from the State Grid Corporation of China and an IEC Market Strategy Board
    member, served as the project sponsor.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper
    is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/zero-carbon-power-system-based-primarily-renewable-energy\">free
