abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63226:2021 is intended for use as guidance for reducing fire risks
    in general and for site-specific needs for buildings with PV systems. In addition
    to the general recommendations, technical, installation, and maintenance measures
    can be selected to reach the intended safety level of the PV system and building,
    depending on the results of a risk assessment. This document contains general
    information about building related risks and includes measures for reducing those
    risks. These measures are not general requirements or recommendations. They are
    explained as a guide for selecting suitable measures depending on the on-site
    needs.
