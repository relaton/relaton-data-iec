abstract:
- content: "IEC 62343:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62343:2023
    applies to all commercially available optical dynamic modules and devices. It
    describes the products covered by the IEC 62343 series, defines terminology, fundamental
    considerations and basic approaches. The object of this document is to:<br />\r\n-
    establish uniform requirements for operation, reliability and environmental properties
    of dynamic modules (DMs) to be implemented in the appropriate DM standard, and<br
    />\r\n- provide assistance to the purchaser in the selection of consistently high-quality
    DM products for their particular applications, as well as in the consultation
    of the appropriate specific DM standard(s).<br />\r\nThis document covers performance
    templates, performance standards, reliability qualification requirements, hardware
    and software interfaces and related testing methods. Since a dynamic module integrates
    an optical module/device, printed wiring board, and software/firmware, the standards
    developed in the series will mimic appropriate existing standards. On the other
    hand, since \"dynamic module\" is a relatively new product category, the dynamic
    module standards series will not be bound by the existing practices where requirements
    differ.The safety standards as related to dynamic modules are mostly optical power
    considerations, which is covered by the IEC 60825 series (see Clause 6). This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2017. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    addition of terms and definitions for optical multicast switches (3.8);<br />\r\n-
    revision of Clause 4, listing the requirements for standards in the IEC 62343
    series;<br />\r\n- addition of Clause 6 (Safety requirements)."
