  content: "IEC 61803:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61803:2020 applies to
    all line-commutated high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converter stations used
    for power exchange (power transmission or back-to-back installation) in utility
    systems. This document presumes the use of 12-pulse thyristor converters but can,
    with due care, also be used for 6-pulse thyristor converters. In some applications,
    synchronous compensators or static var compensators (SVC) may be connected to
    the AC bus of the HVDC converter station. The loss determination procedures for
    such equipment are not included in this document. This document presents a set
    of standard procedures for determining the total losses of an HVDC converter station.
    The procedures cover all parts, except as noted above, and address no-load operation
    and operating losses together with their methods of calculation which use, wherever
    possible, measured parameters. Converter station designs employing novel components
    or circuit configurations compared to the typical design assumed in this document,
    or designs equipped with unusual auxiliary circuits that could affect the losses,
    are assessed on their own merits. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- to facilitate
    the application of this document and to ensure its quality remains consistent,
    5.1.8 and 5.8 have been reviewed, taking into consideration that the present thyristor
    production technology provides considerably less thyristor parameters dispersion
    comparing with the situation in 1999 when the first edition of IEC 61803 was developed,
    and therefore the production records of thyristors can be used for the power losses
    calculation;<br />\r\n- the calculation of the total station load losses (cases
    D1 and D2 in Annex C) has been corrected.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
