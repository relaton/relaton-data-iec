abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63357:2022(E) describes standardization roadmap of fault test methods
    for integrated circuits used in automotive vehicles. Since automotive vehicles
    are exposed in harsh environment such as very low or high temperature, vibration,
    high frequency signals, etc. Therefore, they are tested for possible faults which
    can be caused by harsh environment. There are several fault test methods and related
    issues to be standardized.<br />\r\nSemiconductor devices used in automotive vehicles
    are exposed in harsh environment of very high or very low temperature, vibration,
    high frequency signals, etc. Therefore, they are tested for possible faults which
    can be caused by harsh environment Evaluation results following this fault test
    methods will provide robustness of the semiconductor device."
