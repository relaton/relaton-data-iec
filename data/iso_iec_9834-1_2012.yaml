- content: ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012:specifies a tree structure for allocations made by
    a hierarchical structure of Registration Authorities, called the international
    object identifier (OID) tree, which supports the ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER type
    and the ASN.1 OID-IRI type (ISO/IEC 8824-1);registers top-level arcs of the international
    OID tree;specifies procedures which are generally applicable to registration at
    any level of the international OID tree;provides guidelines for the establishment
    and operation of International Registration Authorities for use, when needed,
    by other ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards;provides guidelines
    for additional ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards which choose
    to reference the procedures in ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012;provides a recommended fee
    structure for lower-level Registration Authorities.Information about registration
    for specific objects is contained in separate ITU-T Recommendations and/or International
    Standards.ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012 applies to registration by ITU-T Recommendations
