    <p>ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 specifies the object identifier (OID) resolution system (ORS), including the overall architecture and a DNS-based resolution mechanism.</p>
    <p>It specifies the means for inserting any application-defined information associated with an OID node into the domain name system (DNS) and the means of retrieval of that information using the ORS.</p>
    <p>It does not restrict the number of applications it can support.</p>
    <p>It specifies the required operation of an ORS client, including the mapping of an OID-IRI (internationalized resource identifier) value by the ORS client into a DNS name to produce a DNS query for the specified application information and the processing of any returned information. The ORS has no role in the allocation or registration of OID nodes.</p>
    <p>The required behaviour of an ORS client is specified, but the interfaces to it are specified only in terms of the semantics of the interaction. A bit-level application program interface is platform- and software-dependent, and is not in the scope of ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011. </p>
    <p>It does not include a tutorial or complete specification on the management of DNS zone files; it specifies (only) the DNS resource records that need to be inserted in the zone files in order to support ORS access to the information associated with an OID node.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 specifies required DNS zone file resource records, and prohibits the use of other resource records of a similar form but with different semantics (in DNS zone files in the .oid res.org domain). It does not otherwise restrict the general use of DNS zone files.</p>
