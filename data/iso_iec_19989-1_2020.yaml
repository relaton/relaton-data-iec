abstract:
- content: "<p>For security evaluation of biometric recognition performance and presentation
    attack detection for biometric verification systems and biometric identification
    systemsthis document specifies:</p><p>— extended security functional components
    to SFR Classes in ISO/IEC 15408-2;</p><p>— supplementary activities to methodology
    specified in ISO/IEC 18045 for SAR Classes of ISO/IEC 15408-3.</p><p>This document
    introduces the general framework for the security evaluation of biometric systems,
    including extended security functional components, and supplementary activities
    to methodology, which is additional evaluation activities and guidance/recommendations
    for an evaluator to handle those activities. The supplementary evaluation activities
    are developed in this document while the detailed recommendations are developed
    in ISO/IEC 19989-2 (for biometric recognition aspects) and in ISO/IEC 19989-3
    (for presentation attack detection aspects). This document is applicable only
    to TOEs for single biometric characteristic type. However, the selection of a
    characteristic from multiple characteristics in SFRs is allowed.</p>"
