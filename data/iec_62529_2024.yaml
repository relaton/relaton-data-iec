abstract:
- content: IEC 62529:2024 provides the means to define and describe signals used in
    testing. It provides a set of common basic signal definitions, built upon formal
    mathematical specifications, so that signals can be combined to form complex signals
    usable across all test platforms. The standard provides support for structural
    textual languages and programming language interfaces for interoperability. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2007, and
    constitutes a technical revision.
