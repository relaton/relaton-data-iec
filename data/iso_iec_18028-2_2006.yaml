abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18028-2:2006 defines a network security architecture for providing
    end-to-end network security. The architecture can be applied to various kinds
    of networks where end-to-end security is a concern and independently of the network's
    underlying technology. The objective of ISO/IEC 18028-2:2006 is to serve as a
    foundation for developing the detailed recommendations for the end-to-end network
    security.</p>"
