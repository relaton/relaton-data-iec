abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63127:2019(E) focuses on the system design of converter stations.
    It is applicable to point-­to-­point and back-to-back HVDC systems based on line-commutated
    converter (LCC) technology. This document provides guidance and supporting information
    on the procedure for system design and the technical issues involved in the system
    design of HVDC transmission projects for both purchaser and potential suppliers.
    It can be used as the basis for drafting a procurement specification and as a
    guide during project implementation.
