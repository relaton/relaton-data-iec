    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies the process assessment model (PAM). It contains process definitions of the ITES-BPO lifecycle defined in ISO/IEC 30105-1 and a model suitable for assessing process capability. The outcomes in the PAM are clearly defined, observable results, aligned to the business benefits derived by the customer and service provider.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">A PAM consists of a set of indicators for process performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the objective evidence that enables an assessor to determine ratings. The set of indicators included in this document is not intended to be an all-inclusive set, nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety. Supersets and subsets are selected according to the context and the scope of the assessment.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The PAM in this document is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors who wish to select a model and an associated documented assessment process for the ITES-BPO lifecycle processes, for process capability gap determination.</span></p>
