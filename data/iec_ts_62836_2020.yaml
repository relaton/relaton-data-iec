abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62836:2020(E) provides an efficient and reliable procedure to test
    the internal electric field in the insulating materials used for high-voltage
    applications, using the pressure wave propagation (PWP) method. It is suitable
    for a sample with homogeneous insulating materials and an electric field higher
    than 1 kV&#x2F;mm, but it is also dependent on the thickness of the sample and
    the pressure wave generator.
