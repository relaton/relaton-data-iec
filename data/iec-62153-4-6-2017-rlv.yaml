  content: "IEC 62153-4-6:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62153-4-6:2017
    determines the screening effectiveness of a shielded metallic communication cable
    by applying a well-defined current and voltage to the screen of the cable and
    measuring the induced voltage in order to determine the surface transfer impedance.<br
    />\r\nMeasurements in the frequency range from a few kHz up to and above 1 GHz
    can be made with the use of normal high frequency instrumentation."
