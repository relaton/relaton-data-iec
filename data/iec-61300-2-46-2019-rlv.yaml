  content: "IEC 61300-2-46:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-46:2019
    describes a test to determine the suitability of a fibre optic device to withstand
    the environmental condition of high humidity and change of temperature which can
    occur in actual use, storage and/or transport. The test is primarily intended
    to determine the suitability of fibre optic components under conditions of high
    humidity – combined with cyclic temperature changes and, in general, producing
    condensation on the surface of the device under test (DUT). Absorption of moisture
    can result in swelling that would destroy functional utility, cause loss of physical
    strength, and cause changes in other important mechanical properties. Degradation
    of optical properties can also occur. Although not necessarily intended as a simulated
    tropical test, this test can, nevertheless, be useful in determining moisture
    absorption of insulating or covering materials. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) complete revision to harmonize with
    IEC 60068-2-30;<br />\r\nb) addition of detail description Clause 4, General description;<br
    />\r\nc) addition of detail description Clause 5, Apparatus;<br />\r\nd) addition
    of detail description Clause 6, Procedure.<br />\r\nKeywords: suitability of fibre
    optic devices to withstand the environmental condition<br />\r\nThe contents of
    the corrigendum 1 of February 2022 have been included in the English part of this
    of copy."
