    for AC only, for fixed electrical installations, with or without earthing contact,
    with rated voltage above 50 V but not exceeding 440 V and a rated current not
    exceeding 32 A, intended for household and similar purposes, either indoors or
    outdoors. Switched socket-outlets with interlock according to this document consist
    of a combination of socket-outlets according to IEC 60884‑1, interlocked with
    a switch according to IEC 60669‑1 and/or IEC 60669‑2‑1 supplied as a complete
    accessory. The rated current is limited to 16 A maximum for fixed accessories
    provided with screwless terminals.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover requirements
    for flush mounting boxes. However, it covers those requirements for surface-type
    mounting boxes which are necessary for the tests on socket-outlets.<br />\r\nThis
