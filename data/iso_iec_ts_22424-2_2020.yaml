abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO/IEC TS 22424 series supports long-term preservation of EPUB
    publications via a dual strategy. This document makes EPUB compliant with current
    practices of Open Archival Information Systems (OAIS) archives and technical requirements
    of repository systems. The former tend to rely on OAIS in their operations; the
    latter prefer to ingest electronic documents only in containers conforming to
    standards such as METS (Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 22424-1 considers EPUB features from a long-term preservation point of view.</p>"
