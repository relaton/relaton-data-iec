  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 19797:2004 measures output and by the linearization method
    (LM).There is a table of output values and a graph for the first and linearized
    output. This method produces a linear relationship between the linear digital
    input data and the output data on a visual relative CIELAB scale for the colour
    primaries. The visual uniformity of overprint scales can be improved by this method.
    The method is applicable for systems that do not have colour management or as
    a linearization method for devices that could be used as a setup_state for colour
    management.</p>"
