  content: "IEC 60364-7-722:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<div>IEC 60364-7-722:2018
    applies to:<br />\r\n• circuits intended to supply energy to electric vehicles,
    and<br />\r\n• circuits intended for feeding back electricity from electric vehicles.<br
    />\r\nCircuits covered by this document are terminated at the connecting point.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) introduction of requirements for electrical
    installations incorporating wireless power transfer systems;<br />\r\nb) clarification
    of the requirements regarding the protective measure placing out of reach in order
    to allow the use of pantographs in areas accessible to the public;<br />\r\nc)
    introduction of requirements covering the case where the EV may operate as a source
    in parallel with other sources.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The requirements for EV supply
    equipment for conductive charging and the relevant charging modes are described
    in IEC 61851 (all parts). The requirements for EV supply equipment for wireless
    power transfer are described in IEC 61980 (all parts).<br />\r\nNOTE 2 IEC 60364-7-722
    does not cover the assessment of the risk of explosion due to the possible production
    of hydrogen/other flammable gases during the battery recharging phase.</div>"
