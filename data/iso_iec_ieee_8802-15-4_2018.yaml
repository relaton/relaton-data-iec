abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-15-4:2018 defines the physical layer (PHY) and medium
    access control (MAC) sublayer specifications for low-data-rate wireless connectivity
    with fixed, portable, and moving devices with no battery or very limited battery
    consumption requirements. In addition, the standard provides modes that allow
    for precision ranging. PHYs are defined for devices operating various license-free
    bands in a variety of geographic regions.
