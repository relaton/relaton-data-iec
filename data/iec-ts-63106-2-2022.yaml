  content: IEC TS 63106-2:2022 provides recommendations for Low Voltage (LV) DC power
    simulators used for testing photovoltaic (PV) power conversion equipment (PCE)
    to utility interconnection or PV performance standards. This document primarily
    addresses DC power simulators used for testing of grid-interactive PCE, also referred
    to as grid-connected power converters (GCPCs). It also addresses some uses of
    DC power simulators for testing stand-alone and multi-mode PCEs.
