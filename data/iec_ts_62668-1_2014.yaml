abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62668-1:2014(en) defines requirements for avoiding the use of counterfeit,
    recycled and fraudulent components used in the aerospace, defence and high performance
    (ADHP) industries. It also defines requirements for ADHP industries to maintain
    their intellectual property for all of their products and services. The risks
    associated with purchasing components outside of franchised distributor networks
    are considered in IEC TS 62668-2. Although developed for the avionics industry,
    this specification may be applied by other high performance and high reliability
    industries at their discretion. This new edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br /> \n- update of \"fraudulent
    component\" definition, addition of \"recycled component\" and \"suspect component\"
    definitions, and update of the concerned clauses accordingly;<br /> \n- addition
    of counterfeit awareness training as a requirement;<br />\n- revision to update
    all references and web links in the annexes."
