  content: IEC/PAS 61249-6-3:2011(E) covers finished fabrics woven from "E" glass
    electrical grade glass fiber yarns that are intended as a reinforcing material
    in laminated plastics for electrical and electronic use. All fabrics covered by
    this specification are plain weave. This specification determines the nomenclature,
    definitions, general and chemical requirements for the glass, and physical requirements
    for finished woven glass fiber fabrics. Appendix II of this specification provides
    a style designator for each finished fabric glass style, with specifications on
    yarn, fabric count, thickness and weight in both SI and US system. Fabrics listed
    in Annex B also categorize fabrics by their current availability status.
