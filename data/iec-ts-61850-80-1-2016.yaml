  script: Latn
  content: 'IEC TS 61850-80-1:2016(E) gives a guideline on how to exchange information
    from a CDC-based data model (for example IEC 61850) using IEC 60870-5-101 or IEC
    60870-5-104 between substation(s) and control center(s). Mostly guidelines for
    functions needed in a substation gateway device are given. The goal of this technical
    specification is to describe standardized mapping of device-oriented data models
    (for example IEC 61850) with already defined attributes of CDCs and services (for
    example IEC 61850-7) onto the already defined ASDUs and services of IEC 60870-5-104
    or IEC 60870-5-101. This second edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition: it makes reference to Edition 2
    standards of the IEC 61850 series, more particularly to IEC 61850-7-3:2010, which
    introduces new Common Data Classes (CDCs).'
