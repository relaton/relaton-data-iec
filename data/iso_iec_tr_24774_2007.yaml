abstract:
- content: 'An increasing number of international, national and industry standards
    describe process models. These models are developed for a range of purposes including
    process implementation and assessment. The terms and descriptions used in such
    models vary in format, content and level of prescription. ISO/IEC TR 24774:2007
    presents guidelines for the elements used most frequently in describing a process:
    the title, purpose statement, outcomes, activities and tasks. Whilst the primary
    purpose of ISO/IEC TR 24774:2007 is to encourage consistency in standard process
    reference models, the guidelines it provides may be applied to any process model
    developed for any purpose.'
