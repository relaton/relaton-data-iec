abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-3-15:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62841-3-15:2024
    is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC 62841-1 (2014).<br
    />\r\nThis document supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 62841-1:2014,
    so as to convert it into the IEC Standard: Particular requirements for transportable
    magnetic drills.<br />\r\nWhere a particular subclause of IEC 62841-1:2014 is
    not mentioned in this Part 3-15, that subclause applies as far as relevant. Where
    this document states \"addition\", \"modification\" or \"replacement\", the relevant
    text in IEC 62841-1:2014 is to be adapted accordingly.<br />\r\nIEC 62841-1:2014,
    Clause 1 is applicable, except as follows.<br />\r\nAddition: This document applies
    to transportable magnetic drills which can include a liquid system."
