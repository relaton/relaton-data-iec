abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63222-2:2023 defines technical requirements for designing a power
    quality monitoring system for public power supply networks. It is applicable for
    LV, MV and HV public power supply networks.<br />\r\nThe design procedure of a
    power quality monitoring system (PQMS) generally includes the following four steps:<br
    />\r\n• Step 1: purpose and application analysis: Analyse power quality monitoring
    (PQM) demand and define the purpose of PQM.<br />\r\n• Step 2: preliminary study:
    Collect background information such as network configuration, the parameters of
    instrument transformers, e.g. the output levels and performance capabilities,
    attributes of loads or distributed generations (DG), communication conditions,
    budgets, and other restrictive conditions, and select the parameters to be monitored
    and monitoring sites according to corresponding principles.<br />\r\n• Step 3:
    system structure design: Design the overall structure of the monitoring system
    according to the monitoring purpose based on the analysis of the advantages and
    disadvantages of various system structures.<br />\r\n• Step 4: detailed design
    of functional modules: Design the function modules of data collection, communication,
    data storage, data processing and analysis in detail according to the functional
    requirements.<br />\r\nThis document defines the main purposes of PQM and gives
    recommendations for preliminary study, such as how to select monitoring sites
    and monitoring parameters and whether the instrument transformer is suitable for
    monitoring. This document also classifies the PQMS structure and specifies the
    functional requirements of the modules such as data collection, communication,
    data storage, data processing and analysis."
