  content: "IEC TS 62998-3:2023 gives guidance on:<br />\r\n- analysis of sensor technologies
    of different wavelength ranges, measurement methods, and the sensing unit arrangement
    in an SRS, respectively the arrangement of SRSs in an SRSS;<br />\r\n- representative
    physical properties of safety-related objects with due consideration of their
    material characteristics and the sensor technology/technologies used in an SRS/SRSS
    to achieve the detection capability and comparable results during verification
    and validation;<br />\r\n- analysis of the interference of objects present in
    the surrounding on the safety related objects and thereby the influence on the
    dependability of the detection capability;<br />\r\n- use of algorithms during
    design, development and maintenance to achieve appropriate detection capability
    and dependability of detection;<br />\r\n- appropriate use of algorithms during
    the integration of SRS or SRSS by the integrator to improve execution of measurement
    information or provide decision information derived from measurement information.<br
    />\r\nIf an SRS/SRSS uses sensor technologies not stated in this document, then
    the generic approach in accordance with IEC TS 62998-1 applies."
