abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 63037:2019 is available as IEC TR 63037:2019 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><p>IEC TR 63037:2019
    provides guidance to controlgear/integrated lamp designers for the development
    of products suitable to operate with future phase-cut dimmers. It describes the
    possible voltage signals and the expected response of the controlgear/integrated
    lamps. This document describes the expected response of controlgear during all
    operation states of a phase-cut lighting system and provides a complete understanding
    of the requirements for phase-cut dimmers. The response of a phase-cut dimmer
    is described in IEC 60669-2‑1:—, Annex EE. This document specifies the system
    performance aspects and test procedures for the control by mains voltage phase-cut
    dimming of the brightness of mains operated electronic lighting equipment intended
    to be controlled by mains voltage phase-cut dimmers, such as LED integrated lamps
    and light sources with external controlgear. Safety requirements are not covered
    by this document, but by respective product standards. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- emission of audible noise;<br />\r\n-
    ghosting caused by issues that are not related to the power supply of the dimmer
    or synchronization;<br />\r\n- stability of phase angle waveform (for the dimmer),
    including symmetry and stability tests;<br />\r\n- flicker of light loads;<br
    />\r\n- repetitive ring up voltage;<br />\r\n- dimming range; and<br />\r\n- number
    of switching cycles have been added.</p>"
