abstract:
- content: "IEC 60939-3:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60939-3:2024
    covers passive filters used to attenuate unwanted radio-frequency signals (such
    as noise or interference) generated from electromagnetic sources. Both single
    and multi-channel filters within one enclosure or which are built on a printed
    circuit board forming a compact entity are included within the scope of this document.
    This document applies to passive filter units for electromagnetic interference
    suppression for which safety tests are appropriate. This implies that filters
    specified according to this document will either be connected to mains supplies,
    when compliance with the mandatory tests of Table B.1 is necessary, or used in
    other circuit positions where the equipment specification specifies that some
    or all of these safety tests are required. This document applies to passive filter
    units, which will be connected to an AC mains or other supply (DC or AC) with
    a nominal voltage not exceeding 1 000 V AC, with a nominal frequency not exceeding
    400 Hz, or 1 500 V DC. Note: For AC use, IEC 60384-14 applies to capacitors which
    will be connected to AC mains with a nominal frequency not exceeding 100 Hz. This
    document covers appliance filters (US) but does not cover facility filters, cord-connected
    filters or direct plug-in filters. These other filters will be covered by another
    sectional specification.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) separated
    clauses for safety and performance tests;<br />\r\nb) added note for use of multiple
    X capacitors bridging basic insulation in 3 phase filters;<br />\r\nc) characteristics
    and conditions to substitute X and Y capacitors are now described in a separate
    Subclause 4.1;<br />\r\nd) creepage and clearance tables updated and in line with
    the latest editions of IEC 60938-2 and IEC 60664-1;<br />\r\ne) allowing voltage
    measurement for inductance measurements (7.3);<br />\r\nf) added requirements
    for marking depending on remaining energy after disconnection;<br />\r\ng) added
    content of CTL DSH 2044:2016 for temperature test of IEC filters;<br />\r\nh)
    added note about temperature rise required specimens for safety testing;<br />\r\ni)
    changed index of capacitors in Annex A to avoid confusion between index name and
    capacitor class;<br />\r\nj) moved tests from group 1A to 2. Now, samples in group
    1A need to be submitted without potting;<br />\r\nk) revision of all parts of
    the document has taken place based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2021, and
    harmonization with other similar kinds of documents. Annex X contains all cross-references
    of changes in clause/subclause numbers."
