  content: "IEC 60092-376:2017 is applicable to screened and unscreened cables for
    control and instrumentation circuits on ships and offshore units. The cables have
    extruded solid insulation with a voltage rating of 150/250V (300V) and are intended
    for fixed installations.<br />\r\nThe various types of cables are given in Clause
    5. The constructional requirements and test methods are aligned with those indicated
    in IEC 60092-350, unless otherwise specified in this document.<br />\r\nThe object
    of this document is:<br />\r\n- to standardise cables whose safety and reliability
    are ensured when they are installed in accordance with the requirements of IEC
    60092-352,<br />\r\n- to lay down standard manufacturing requirements and characteristics
    of such cables directly or indirectly bearing on safety, and<br />\r\n- to specify
    test methods for checking conformity with those requirements.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new structure in line with IEC 60092-353 and IEC 60092-354;<br
    />\r\n- requirements and test methods have been divided in several tables for
    clarification (enhanced cold properties, oil resistance or resistance to drilling
    fluids) and have been aligned to IEC 60092-350;<br />\r\n- the new testing methods
    for fire resistant cables are referenced in this document."
