  content: ISO 80601-2-67:2014 is applicable to the basic safety and essential performance
    of oxygen conserving equipment, hereafter referred to as me equipment, in combination
    with its accessories intended to conserve supplemental oxygen by delivering gas
    intermittently and synchronized with the patient's inspiratory cycle, when used
    in the home healthcare environment. Oxygen conserving equipment is typically used
    by a lay operator. ISO 80601-2-67:2014 is also applicable to those accessories
    intended by their manufacturer to be connected to conserving equipment, where
    the characteristics of those accessories can affect the basic safety or essential
    performance of the conserving equipment.
