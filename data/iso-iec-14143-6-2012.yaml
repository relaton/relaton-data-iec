    <p>ISO/IEC 14143-6:2012 provides a summary of the FSM (Functional Size Measurement) related standards and the relationship between:</p>
    <p>a)     the ISO/IEC 14143 series FSM framework standards that provide the definitions and concepts of FSM and conformance and verification of FSMMs (Functional Size Measurement Methods), and </p>
    <p>b)     the ISO/IEC standard FSMMs, i.e. ISO/IEC 19761 (COSMIC), ISO/IEC 20926 (IFPUG), ISO/IEC 20968 (Mk II), ISO/IEC 24570 (NESMA), and ISO/IEC 29881 (FiSMA).</p>
    <p>An FSMM is a software sizing method that conforms to the mandatory requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 14143-6:2012 also provides a process to assist users to select an FSMM that meets their requirements. </p>
    <p>It also gives guidance on how to use Functional Size (FS).  </p>
    <p>FSMMs include, but are not limited to, ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926, ISO/IEC 20968, ISO/IEC 24570, and ISO/IEC 29881 as well. </p>
    <p>Recommending a specific FSMM is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 14143-6:2012.</p>
