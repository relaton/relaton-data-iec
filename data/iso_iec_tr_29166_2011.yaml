abstract:
- content: "<p>OASIS Open Document Format ODF 1.0 (ISO/IEC 26300) and Office Open
    XML (ISO/IEC 29500) are both open document formats for saving and exchanging word
    processing documents, spreadsheets and presentations. Both formats are XML based
    but differ in design and scope.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 29166:2012 aims at analysing
    the two International Standards and their underlying concepts in terms of interoperability
    issues for a selected set of features. It analyses the way these features are
    implemented in both International Standards and estimates the degree of translatability
    between them using a table-based comparison. ISO/IEC TR 29166:2012 serves as a
    preliminary technical translation guideline for evaluating translatability between
    certain parts of the two International Standards. It does not compare different
    implementations which can cause additional kinds of interoperability problems.</p><p>It
    starts by studying common use cases to identify how the most important functionalities
    of one document format can be represented in the other format. This is followed
    by a thorough review of the concepts, architectures and various features of the
    two document formats in order to provide a good understanding of the commonalities
    and differences. It is expected that functionalities will be able to be translated
    with different degrees of fidelity to the other format. As an illustrative sample
    of this functionality, detailed information is provided on the extent to which
    those functionalities can be translated.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 29166:2012 addresses
    both developers seeking to implement either ISO/IEC 26300 or ISO/IEC 29500 and
    template designers and other power users whose competences cut across the spectrum
    of XML and XML-related technologies which directly or remotely deal with one or
    both of the two International Standards. ISO/IEC TR 29166:2012 will be of great
    assistance to those seeking to exchange documents between formats, to extract
    data from or import data into documents, or to write applications supporting the
    two formats. ISO/IEC TR 29166:2012 is a necessary step to the goal of helping
    achieve interoperability and harmonization between the two formats. It should
    encourage standards bodies as well as the developers of office suites to translate
    some of the ideas into future versions of the standards and products.</p>"
