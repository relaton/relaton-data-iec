    1.1 Purpose<p>This document provides a set of critical system of systems (SoS) considerations to be addressed at key points in the life cycle of the system of interest (SoI). This document refers to considerations that apply to an SoI that is a constituent system that interacts in an SoS. The considerations and life cycle model align with those which are already defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1. Selected subsets of these considerations can be applied throughout the life of systems through the involvement of stakeholders. The ultimate goal is to achieve customer satisfaction, so that when delivered, the SoI will operate effectively in the operational or business environment which is typically characterized as one or more systems of systems.</p><p>This document concerns those systems that are man-made and are configured with one or more of the following: hardware, software, humans, procedures and facilities.</p>
    1.2 Field of application<p>This document addresses SoS considerations that apply to systems at each stage of their respective life cycles.</p><p>There is a wide variety of systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application, complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans and evolution. This document is concerned with describing the system of systems considerations that apply to a system that is the SoI; that is a constituent system within a system of systems. It applies to one-of-a-kind systems, mass produced systems or customized, adaptable systems.</p>
    1.3 Limitations<p>This document does not detail the approach to addressing system of systems considerations in terms of methods or procedures.</p><p>This document does not detail the described documentation in terms of name, format, explicit content and recording media of documentation.</p>
