abstract:
- content: "1.1 Purpose<br />\r\nThis document provides a set of critical system of
    systems (SoS) considerations to be addressed at key points in the life cycle of
    the system of interest (SoI). This document refers to considerations that apply
    to an SoI that is a constituent system that interacts in an SoS. The considerations
    and life cycle model align with those which are already defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-1. Selected subsets of these considerations can be
    applied throughout the life of systems through the involvement of stakeholders.
    The ultimate goal is to achieve customer satisfaction, so that when delivered,
    the SoI will operate effectively in the operational or business environment which
    is typically characterized as one or more systems of systems.<br />\r\nThis document
    concerns those systems that are man-made and are configured with one or more of
    the following: hardware, software, humans, procedures and facilities.<br />\r\n1.2
    Field of application<br />\r\nThis document addresses SoS considerations that
    apply to systems at each stage of their respective life cycles.<br />\r\nThere
    is a wide variety of systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application,
    complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans and
    evolution. This document is concerned with describing the system of systems considerations
    that apply to a system that is the SoI; that is a constituent system within a
    system of systems. It applies to one-of-a-kind systems, mass produced systems
    or customized, adaptable systems.<br />\r\n1.3 Limitations<br />\r\nThis document
    does not detail the approach to addressing system of systems considerations in
    terms of methods or procedures.<br />\r\nThis document does not detail the described
    documentation in terms of name, format, explicit content and recording media of
    documentation."
