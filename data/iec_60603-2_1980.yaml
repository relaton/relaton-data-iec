    features
    Applies to groups of related two-part connectors for use with printed boards. They range from connectors with high contact density for low-voltage applications to connectors for heavy currents and high voltages having fewer contacts (Types B, C, D, F and G).
    Also applies to Type M two-part connectors supplied in alternative versions having 2, 4 or 6 holes for fitting special contacts, for example, coaxial, for high voltages or heavy currents (see Appendix A), as well as 78, 60 or 42 normal contacts identical with those of Group C. Applies further to two-part connectors of Types Q, R. S, U and V whose male contacts are fitted to the fixed connectors and the female contacts to the board-mounted connectors.
    The fixed connectors are provided either with solder contacts or with crimp, wrap or pressure contacts. The terminations of the fixed connectors are located in such a way as to be suitable for use with mother boards using a grid as well as for automatic wiring techniques.
