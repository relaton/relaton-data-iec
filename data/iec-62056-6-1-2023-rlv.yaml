  content: "IEC 62056-6-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62056-6-1:2023
    specifies the overall structure of the OBject Identification System (OBIS) and
    the mapping of all commonly used data items in metering equipment to their identification
    codes.OBIS provides a unique identifier for all data within the metering equipment,
    including not only measurement values, but also abstract values used for configuration
    or obtaining information about the behaviour of the metering equipment. The ID
    codes defined in this document are used for the identification of:<br />\r\n-
    logical names of the various instances of the ICs, or objects, as defined in IEC
    62056‑6‑2:2023;<br />\r\n- data transmitted through communication lines;<br />\r\n-
    data displayed on the metering equipment, see Clause A.2 in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to all types of metering equipment, such as fully integrated
    meters, modular meters, tariff attachments, data concentrators, etc.<br />\r\nTo
    cover metering equipment measuring energy types other than electricity, combined
    metering equipment measuring more than one type of energy or metering equipment
    with several physical measurement channels, the concepts of medium and channels
    are introduced. This allows meter data originating from different sources to be
    identified. While this document fully defines the structure of the identification
    system for other media, the mapping of non-electrical energy related data items
    to ID codes is completed separately<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition of IEC 62056-6-1, published in 2017. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. The main technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition are listed in Annex B (informative)."
