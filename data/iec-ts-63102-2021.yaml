  content: "IEC TS 63102:2021(E) highlights recommended technical methods of grid
    code compliance assessment for grid connection of wind and PV power plants as
    the basic components of grid connection evaluation. The electrical behaviour of
    wind and PV power plants in this technical specification includes frequency and
    voltage range, reactive power capability, control performance including active
    power based control and reactive power based control, fault ride through capability
    and power quality.</br>\r\nCompliance assessment is the process of determining
    whether the electrical behaviour of wind and PV power plants meets specific technical
    requirements in grid codes or technical regulations. The assessment methods include
    compliance testing, compliance simulation and compliance monitoring. The input
    for compliance assessment includes relevant supporting documents, testing results
    and validated simulation models, and continuous monitoring data. The scope of
    this technical specification only covers assessment methods from a technical aspect;
    processes related to certification are not included.</br>\r\nThis technical specification
    is applicable to wind and PV power plants connected to the electrical power grid."
