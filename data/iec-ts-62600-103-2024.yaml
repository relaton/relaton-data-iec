  content: "IEC TS 62600-103:2024 is concerned with the sub-prototype scale development
    of wave energy converters (WECs). It includes wave tank test programmes, where
    wave conditions are controlled so they can be scheduled, and first sea trials,
    where sea states occur naturally and the programmes are adjusted and flexible
    to accommodate the conditions. Commercial-scale prototype tests are not covered
    in this document.<br />\r\nThis document addresses:<br />\r\n- Planning an experimental
    programme, including a design statement, technical drawings, facility selection,
    site data and other inputs as specified in Clause 5.<br />\r\n- Device characterisation,
    including the physical device model, PTO components and mooring arrangements where
    appropriate.<br />\r\n- Environment characterisation, concerning either the tank
    testing facility or the sea deployment site, depending on the stage of development.<br
    />\r\n- Specification of specific test goals, including power conversion performance,
    device motions, device loads and device survival.<br />\r\nThis document prescribes
    the minimum test programmes that form the basis of a structured technology development
    schedule. For each testing campaign, the prerequisites, goals and minimum test
    plans are specified. This document serves a wide audience of wave energy stakeholders,
    including device developers and their technical advisors; government agencies
    and funding councils; test centres and certification bodies; private investors;
    and environmental regulators and NGOs."
