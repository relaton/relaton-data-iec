abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15026-1:2013 defines assurance-related terms and establishes
    an organized set of concepts and their relationships, thereby establishing a basis
    for shared understanding of the concepts and principles central to all parts of
    ISO/IEC 15026 across its user communities. It provides information to users of
    the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including the use of each part and the
    combined use of multiple parts.</p><p>Coverage of assurance for a service being
    operated and managed on an ongoing basis is not covered in ISO/IEC 15026.</p>"
