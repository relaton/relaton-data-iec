abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC TR 11801:2014(E) covers the following channel descriptions
    constructed from components with a nominal impedance of 100:\r\n- Class I: 30
    m channel based on upcoming Category 8.1 components. This channel provides increased
    margin compared to ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801, Class EA channels, and an upper frequency
    limit of 1 600 MHz (2 000 MHz (ffs);\r\n- Class II: 30 m channel based on upcoming
    Category 8.2 components. This channel provides increased margin compared to ISO&#x2F;IEC
    11801, Class FA channels, and an upper frequency limit of 1 600 MHz (2 000 MHz
    ffs);\r\n- Channels based on Category 6A components of ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801, length
    corrected to 30 m;\r\n- Channels based on Category 7A components of ISO&#x2F;IEC
    11801, length corrected to 30 m;\r\n- Channels based on Category 6A components
    of ISO&#x2F;IEC 11801, length corrected to 30 m, characterized beyond the current
    upper frequency;\r\n- Channels based on Category 7A components of ISO&#x2F;IEC
    11801, length corrected to 30 m, characterized beyond the current upper frequency."
