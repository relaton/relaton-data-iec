  content: to present the background considerations which led to this compilation
    of potentials of the aqueous saturated calomel electrode compared to the cyclovoltametric
    data for a glassy carbon electrode in various solvent media. A tabulation of working
    potentials of this electrode pair in various solvent media is presented. A comparison
    of the cyclovoltametric scans for the ferricinium/ferrocene and deamethyl derivatized
    ferricinium/ferrocene redox couple system is presented and important features
    are discussed
