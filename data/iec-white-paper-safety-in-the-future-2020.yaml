  content: "Advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things are
    transforming how humans and electrotechnical systems interconnect. With the introduction
    of new technologies, it is critically important to ensure that human safety remains
    at the centre of the human-machine relationship.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nEach year,
    several million workers are injured on the job. Aside from the economic cost,
    this is the source of immeasurable suffering that is largely preventable.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nUsing real-life examples, this white paper addresses safety in the future
    by exploring current social trends and initiatives as well as projects that are
    pioneering innovative safety solutions. All of them are based on the concept that
    safety will be integral to systems in which humans and machines closely interface.
    The paper also introduces a collaborative framework – the tripartite system for
    safety – which offers a systematic approach to examining key safety elements.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nBringing these safety concepts to fruition will require significant
    standardization efforts to mitigate challenges related to decision-making involving
    machines and humans.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe white paper formulates recommendations
    both of a general nature as well as to the IEC community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe
    white paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>)
    safety in the future project team, directed by Dr Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, MSB Convenor,
    Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, with major contributions from the lead project
    partner, Dr Coen van Gulijk, TNO, the Netherlands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC
    White Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/safety-future\">free
