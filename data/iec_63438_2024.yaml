abstract:
- content: "IEC 63438:2024 applies to the electrical protection system, provided for
    AC and DC electric traction power supply systems. It:<br />\r\n– establishes railway
    specific protection principles;<br />\r\n– describes the railway specific protection
    system functionality;<br />\r\n– specifies minimum functional requirements and
    informative examples of their application;<br />\r\n– establishes limitations
    of the protection system and the acceptability of residual risks;<br />\r\n– specifies
    principles for design verification.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to:<br
    />\r\n– railways;<br />\r\n– guided mass transport systems, such as tramways,
    elevated and underground railways, mountain railways, trolleybus systems, and
    magnetically levitated systems which use a contact line system.<br />\r\nThis
    document can also be applied to electrified road traffic with a contact line,
    such as truck-trolley systems.<br />\r\nThis document applies to new electric
    traction power supply systems and can be applied to changes of existing systems.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to:<br />\r\n– underground mine traction systems;<br
    />\r\n– cranes, transportable platforms and similar transportation equipment on
    rails, temporary structures (e.g. exhibition structures) in so far as these are
    not supplied directly or via transformers from the contact line system and are
    not endangered by the traction power supply system;<br />\r\n– suspended cable
    cars;<br />\r\n– funicular railways;<br />\r\n– magnetic levitated systems (without
    a contact line system);<br />\r\n– railways with an inductive power supply without
    contact system;<br />\r\n– railways with a buried contact system that is required
    to be energized only below the train to ensure safety.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not cover:<br />\r\n– technical requirements for products, e.g. protection
    devices;<br />\r\n– rules for maintenance of protection systems."
