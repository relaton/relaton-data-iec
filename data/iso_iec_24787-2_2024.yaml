abstract:
- content: "This document provides requirements for a biometric comparison methodology
    suitable for the on-card environment. In particular, it establishes the work-sharing
    on-card biometric comparison techniques that require an intensity exceeding the
    capabilities of integrated circuit cards (ICCs).<br />\r\nThis document does not
    establish<br />\r\n- architectures of biometric comparison using an ICC,<br />\r\n-
    on-card biometric comparison, both in sensor-off-card systems and as part of biometric
    system-on-card,<br />\r\n- security policies for on-card biometric comparison,<br
    />\r\n- requirements for off-card biometric comparison,<br />\r\n- requirements
    for biometric system-on-card (defined in the ISO/IEC 17839 series), or<br />\r\n-
    modality-specific requirements for storage and comparison."
