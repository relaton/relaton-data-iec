  content: 'IEC 61174: 2008 specifies the performance requirements, methods of testing
    and required test results of equipment conforming to performance standards not
    inferior to those adopted by IMO in resolution MSC.232(82). Is based upon the
    performance standards of IMO resolution MSC.232(82), and is also associated with
    IMO resolution A.694(17) and IEC 60945. The main changes with respect to the previous
    edition are: incorporation of revised performance standards for ECDIS adopted
    by the IMO as resolution MSC.232(82) in December 2006; update of test methods
    in accordance; incorporation of the revised IMO performance standards.'
