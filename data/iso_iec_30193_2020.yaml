abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm rewritable optical disk with a capacity of 100,0 Gbytes. It specifies
    the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and
    the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of
    such disks. User data can be written, read and overwritten many times using a
    reversible method. This disk is identified as a BD rewritable disk.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies the following:<br />\r\n— the one disk type;<br />\r\n— the
    conditions for conformance;<br />\r\n— the environments in which the disk is to
    be operated and stored;<br />\r\n— the mechanical and physical characteristics
    of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;<br
    />\r\n— the format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition
    of the tracks and sectors;<br />\r\n— the error-correcting codes and the coding
    method used;<br />\r\n— the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk,
    enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.<br />\r\nThis document
    provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems."
