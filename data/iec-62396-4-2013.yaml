  content: "IEC 62396-4:2013(E) provides guidance on atmospheric radiation effects
    and their management on high voltage (nominally above 200 V) avionics electronics
    used in aircraft operating at altitudes up to 60 000 ft (18,3 km). This part of
    IEC 62396 defines the effects of that environment on high voltage electronics
    and provides design considerations for the accommodation of those effects within
    avionics systems. This part of IEC 62396 provides technical data and methodology
    for aerospace equipment manufacturers and designers to standardise their approach
    to single event effects on high voltage avionics by providing guidance, leading
    to a standard methodology.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in
    conjunction with <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/46408\">IEC
    62396-1:2012</a>."
