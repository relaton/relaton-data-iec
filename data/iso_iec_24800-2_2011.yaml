- content: ISO/IEC 24800-2:2011 specifies a series of interfaces to allow disparate
    systems an interoperable management of image repositories. It also specifies the
    general rules which govern the usage of metadata in JPSearch and provides a specification
    whichprovides rules for the representation of image metadata descriptions, consisting
    of the definition of the JPSearch Core Metadata Schema,provides rules for the
    publication of machine-readable translations between metadata terms belonging
    to proprietary metadata schemas and metadata terms in the JPSearch Core Metadata
    Schema, andprovides rules for the registration and request of metadata schemas
    and its translation rules or links to them.JPSearch is an extensible standard.
    The normative method of extending the structures and rules beyond the JPSearch
