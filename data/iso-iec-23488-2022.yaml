    <p>This document specifies an image-based representation model that represents target objects/environments using a set of images and optionally the underlying 3D model for accurate and efficient objects/environments representation at an arbitrary viewpoint. It is applicable to a wide range of graphic, virtual reality and mixed reality applications which require the method of representing a scene with various objects and environments.</p>
    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>—    defines terms for image-based representation and 3D reconstruction techniques;</p>
    <p>—    specifies the required elements for image-based representation;</p>
    <p>—    specifies a method of representing the real world in the virtual space based on image-based representation;</p>
    <p>—    specifies how visible image patches can be integrated with the underlying 3D model for more accurate and rich objects/environments representation from arbitrary viewpoints;</p>
    <p>—    specifies how the proposed model allows multi-object representation;</p>
    <p>—    provides an XML based specification of the proposed representation model and an actual implementation example (see Annex A).</p>
