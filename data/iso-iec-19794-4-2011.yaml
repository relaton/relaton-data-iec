  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19794-4:2011 specifies a data record interchange format for
    storing, recording, and transmitting the information from one or more finger or
    palm image areas within an ISO/IEC 19785-1 data structure.  This can be used for
    the exchange and comparison of finger image data.  It defines the content, format,
    and units of measurement for the exchange of finger image data that may be used
    in the verification or identification process of a subject.  The information consists
    of a variety of mandatory and optional items, including scanning parameters, compressed
    or uncompressed images and vendor-specific information.  This information is intended
    for interchange among organizations that rely on automated devices and systems
    for identification or verification purposes based on the information from finger
    image areas.  Information compiled and formatted in accordance with ISO/IEC 19794-4:2011
    can be recorded on machine-readable media or may be transmitted by data communication
    facilities. </p>"
