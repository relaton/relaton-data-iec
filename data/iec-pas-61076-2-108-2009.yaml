  content: IEC/PAS 61076-2-108:2009(E) describes circular connectors M12 typically
    used for industrial process measurement and control. These connectors consist
    of fixed glass to metal sealed styles with rewireable male contacts. Female connectors
    have round contacts of diameter 0,6 mm, 0,76 mm, 0,8 mm and 1,0 mm. This PAS complements
    IEC 61076-2-101 Ed.2 by adding glass to metal seal styles and the required testing.
