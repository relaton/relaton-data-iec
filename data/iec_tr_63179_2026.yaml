abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63179:2026, which is a Technical Report, provides technical information
    for planning high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems with line-commutated converters
    (LCC), voltage sourced converters (VSC), or both. It provides general principles
    for deciding between HVDC and AC transmission systems, as well as processes and
    methods for preliminarily defining the HVDC transmission scheme, including selection
    of converter type and key parameters, grid stability analysis, and technical-economic
    comparison among various solutions. In addition, this document gives the objectives
    to be achieved in the planning phase.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable for
    planning a point-to-point or a back-to-back HVDC system.<br />\r\nThis document
    can also be used for DC grid systems (including multi-terminal HVDC systems) as
    a reference.<br />\r\nThis document is not exhaustive. It is possible that there
    are other specific aspects, that are particularly important for a specific HVDC
    project."
