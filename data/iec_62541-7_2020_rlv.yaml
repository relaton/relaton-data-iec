abstract:
- content: "IEC 62541-7:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62541-7:2020 defines
    the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Profiles. The Profiles in this document
    are used to segregate features with regard to testing of OPC UA products and the
    nature of the testing (tool based or lab based). This includes the testing performed
    by the OPC Foundation provided OPC UA CTT (a self-test tool) and by the OPC Foundation
    provided Independent certification test labs. This could equally as well refer
    to test tools provided by another organization or a test lab provided by another
    organization. What is important is the concept of automated tool-based testing
    versus lab-based testing. The scope of this standard includes defining functionality
    that can only be tested in a lab and defining the grouping of functionality that
    is to be used when testing OPC UA products either in a lab or using automated
    tools. The definition of actual TestCases is not within the scope of this document,
    but the general categories of TestCases are within the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nMost OPC UA applications will conform to several, but not all, of the Profiles.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) new functional Profiles:<br />\r\n• profiles for global discovery and
    global certificate management;<br />\r\n• profiles for global KeyCredential management
    and global access token management;<br />\r\n• facet for durable subscriptions;<br
    />\r\n• standard UA Client Profile;<br />\r\n• profiles for administration of
    user roles and permissions.<br />\r\nb) new transport Profiles:<br />\r\n• HTTPS
    with JSON encoding;<br />\r\n• secure WebSockets (WSS) with binary or JSON encoding;<br
    />\r\n• reverse connectivity.<br />\r\nc) new security Profiles:<br />\r\n• transportSecurity
    – TLS 1.2 with PFS (with perfect forward secrecy);<br />\r\n• securityPolicy [A]
    – Aes128-Sha256-RsaOaep (replaces Base128Rsa15);<br />\r\n• securityPolicy – Aes256-Sha256-RsaPss
    adds perfect forward secrecy for UA TCP);<br />\r\n• user Token JWT (Jason Web
    Token).<br />\r\nd) deprecated Security Profiles (due to broken algorithms):<br
    />\r\n• securityPolicy – Basic128Rsa15 (broken algorithm Sha1);<br />\r\n• securityPolicy
    – Basic256 (broken algorithm Sha1);<br />\r\n• transportSecurity – TLS 1.0 (broken
    algorithm RC4);<br />\r\n• transportSecurity – TLS 1.1 (broken algorithm RC4).<br
    />\r\ne) deprecated Transport (missing support on most platforms):<br />\r\n•
    SOAP/HTTP with WS-SecureConversation (all encodings)."
