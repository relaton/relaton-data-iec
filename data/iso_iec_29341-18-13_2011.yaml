abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-18-13:2011(E) describes a service definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a service type referred
    to herein as RATAConfig service. The RATAConfig service is a UPnP service that
    allows control points to provision and configure the parameters that are required
    for enabling a Remote Access Server to accept and a Remote Access Client to initiate
    remote access connections. This service provides control points with the following
    functionality:<br />\r\n- Determine the Remote Access Transport Agents that can
    be configured by the service.<br />\r\n- Determine the delivery mechanisms for
    credentials supported by the service.<br />\r\n- Configure Remote Access Transport
    Agent profiles.<br />\r\n- Management of Remote Access Transport Agent profiles."
