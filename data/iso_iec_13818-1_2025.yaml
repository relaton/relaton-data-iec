abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoNormal">This document specifies the system layer of the coding.
    It was developed principally to support the combination of the video and audio
    coding methods defined in Parts 2 and 3 of ISO/IEC 13818. The system layer supports
    six basic functions:</p><p class="enumlev1">1) the synchronization of multiple
    compressed streams on decoding;</p><p class="enumlev1">2) the interleaving of
    multiple compressed streams into a single stream;</p><p class="enumlev1">3) the
    initialization of buffering for decoding start up;</p><p class="enumlev1">4) continuous
    buffer management;</p><p class="enumlev1">5) time identification;</p><p class="enumlev1">6)
    multiplexing and signalling of various components in a system stream.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A
    Rec. ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 multiplexed bit stream is either a transport
    stream or a program stream. Both streams are constructed from PES packets and
    packets containing other necessary information. Both stream types support multiplexing
    of video and audio compressed streams from one program with a common time base.
    The transport stream additionally supports the multiplexing of video and audio
    compressed streams from multiple programs with independent time bases. For almost
    error-free environments the program stream is generally more appropriate, supporting
    software processing of program information. The transport stream is more suitable
    for use in environments where errors are likely.</p><p class="MsoNormal">A Rec.
    ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 multiplexed bit stream, whether a transport stream
    or a program stream, is constructed in two layers: the outermost layer is the
    system layer, and the innermost is the compression layer. The system layer provides
    the functions necessary for using one or more compressed data streams in a system.
    The video and audio parts of this Specification define the compression coding
    layer for audio and video data. Coding of other types of data is not defined by
    this Specification, but is supported by the system layer provided that the other
    types of data adhere to the constraints defined in 2.7.</p>'
