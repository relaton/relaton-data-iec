abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63363-1:2022(E) is to present the \"state of the art\" with respect
    to general guidance on the steady-state performance demands of VSC HVDC transmission
    systems. It concerns the steady-state performance of two-terminal VSC HVDC transmission
    systems utilizing converters with power flow capability in both directions.<br
    />\r\nDifferent configurations of a VSC HVDC transmission system are covered in
    this document, including the symmetrical monopolar, asymmetrical monopolar, bipolar
    with earth return, bipolar with dedicated metallic return and rigid bipolar configurations.<br
    />\r\nThere are many variations between different VSC HVDC transmission systems.
    This document does not consider these in detail; consequently, it cannot be used
    directly as a specification for a particular project, but rather to provide the
    general basis for the system steady-state performance demands.<br />\r\nNormally,
    the performance specifications are based on a complete system including two VSC
    HVDC converter stations. However, sometimes a VSC HVDC transmission system can
    also be separately specified and purchased from multiple vendors instead of single
    turnkey vendor. In such cases, due consideration can be given to the coordination
    of each part with the overall VSC HVDC system performance objectives and the interface
    of each with the system can be clearly defined. The major components of the VSC
    HVDC transmission system are presented in IEC 62747.<br />\r\nReferring to IEC
    62747, an HVDC substation/converter station is defined as that part of the VSC
    HVDC transmission system which consists of one or more VSC converter units installed
    in a single location together with buildings, reactors, filters, reactive power
    supply, control, monitoring, protective, measuring and auxiliary equipment. The
    AC substations are not covered in this document.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    guidance and supporting information on the procedure for system design and the
    technical issues involved in the system design of VSC HVDC transmission projects
    for both owners and contractors. This document can be used as the basis for drafting
    a procurement specification and as a guide during project implementation."
