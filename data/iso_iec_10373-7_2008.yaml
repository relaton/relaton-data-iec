abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10373 defines test methods for characteristics of identification
    cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced
    to one or more base standards, which may be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the
    supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed
    in identification card applications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10373-7:2008 deals with test
    methods, which are specific to contactless integrated circuit card (vicinity card)
    technology. ISO/IEC 10373-1 deals with test methods which are common to one or
    more ICC technologies and other parts deal with other technology‑specific tests.</p><p>Unless
    otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 10373-7:2008 apply exclusively to vicinity
    cards defined in ISO/IEC 15693‑1 and ISO/IEC 15693-2.</p>"
