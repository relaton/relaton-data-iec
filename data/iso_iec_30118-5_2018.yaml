abstract:
- content: "The OCF Smart Home Device specification is an Application Profile specification.<br
    />\r\nThe Smart Home Device specification specifies the Smart Home devices. The
    Smart Home Device definitions use Resource definitions from the OCF Resource Type
    Specification.<br />\r\nThe Smart Home Device Specification is built on top of
    the Core Specification. The Core Specification specifies the core architecture,
    interfaces protocols and services to enable the implementation of profiles for
    IoT usages and ecosystems. The Core specification also defines the main architectural
    components of network connectivity, discovery, data transmission, device & service
    management and ID & security. The core architecture is scalable to support simple
    devices (constrained devices) and more capable devices (smart devices)."
