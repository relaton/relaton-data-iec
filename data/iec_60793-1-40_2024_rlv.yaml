abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-40:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-40:2024
    establishes uniform requirements for measuring the attenuation of optical fibre,
    thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables for commercial purposes.
    Four methods are described for measuring attenuation, one being that for modelling
    spectral attenuation:<br />\r\n-method A: cut-back;<br />\r\n-method B: insertion
    loss;<br />\r\n-method C: backscattering;<br />\r\n-method D: modelling spectral
    attenuation.<br />\r\nMethods A to C apply to the measurement of attenuation for
    all categories of the following fibres:<br />\r\n-class A multimode fibres;<br
    />\r\n-class B single-mode fibres.<br />\r\nMethod C, backscattering, also covers
    the location, losses and characterization of point discontinuities.<br />\r\nMethod
    D is applicable only to class B fibres.<br />\r\nInformation common to all four
    methods appears in Clause 1 to Clause 11, and information pertaining to each individual
    method appears in Annex A, Annex B, Annex C, and Annex D, respectively.<br />\r\nThis
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2019. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    modifying the definition of attenuation to be compatible with the definition in
    electropedia.org"
