    <p>ISO/IEC 18041-4:2007 specifies the binding of the application programming interface (API) defined in ISO/IEC 18025 to the C programming language.</p>
    <p>The Environmental Data Coding Specification (EDCS) is a mapping between data and meaning. Data in a system may need to be identified as to purpose, metric and usage. This specification defines a standard set of terms for providing this information. ISO/IEC 18041-4:2007 defines a standard binding for the C computer programming language.</p>
