abstract:
- content: "This document defines a process reference model (PRM) for the domain of
    information security management, which is meeting the criteria defined in ISO/IEC
    33004 for process reference models (see Annex A). It is intended to guide users
    of ISO/IEC 27001 to:<br />\r\n- incorporate the process approach as described
    by ISO/IEC 27000:2018, 4.3, within the ISMS;<br />\r\n- be aligned to all the
    work done within other standards of the ISO/IEC 27000 family from the perspective
    of the operation of ISMS processes<br />\r\n- support users in the operation of
    an ISMS? this document is complementing the requirements-oriented perspective
    of ISO/IEC 27003 with an operational, process-oriented point of view."
