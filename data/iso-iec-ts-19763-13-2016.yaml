    <p>The primary purpose of the ISO/IEC 19763 series is to specify a metamodel framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC TS 19763-13(E) specifies a metamodel for registering form designs.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 19763-13(E) provides a metamodel to describe the structure and semantics of an implemented form devoid of any specific, domain semantics, e.g. in healthcare, social science, e-government and e-business, or representation format so that data may be faithfully exchanged between systems and system components, and associations expressed between sets of form designs whose data may be compared, joined or composed for analysis.</p>
