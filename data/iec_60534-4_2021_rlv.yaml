abstract:
- content: "IEC 60534-4:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60534-4:2021
    specifies the requirements for the inspection and routine testing of control valves
    manufactured in conformity with the other parts of IEC 60534. This document is
    applicable to valves with pressure ratings not exceeding Class 2500. The requirements
    for actuators apply only to pneumatic actuators. This document does not apply
    to the types of control valves where radioactive service, fire safety testing,
    or other hazardous service conditions are encountered. If a standard for hazardous
    service conflicts with the requirements of this document, the standard for hazardous
    service should take precedence."
