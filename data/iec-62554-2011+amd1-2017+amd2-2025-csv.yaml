  content: IEC 62554:2011+AMD1:2017+AMD2:2025 CSV specifies sample preparation methods
    for determining mercury levels in new tubular fluorescent lamps (including single
    capped, double capped, self-ballasted and CCFL for backlighting) containing 0,1
    mg mercury or more. The intended resolution of the methods described in this standard
    is of the order of 5 %. Mercury level measurement of spent lamps is excluded,
    as during lamp operation, mercury gradually diffuses into the glass wall and reacts
    with the glass materials. The test method of this standard does not recover mercury
    that is diffused into or reacted with or otherwise incorporated irreversibly with
    the glass wall of discharge tubes. This standard does not contain information
    on measurement. Measurement is specified in IEC 62321.
