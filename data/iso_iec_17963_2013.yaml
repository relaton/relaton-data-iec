abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17963:2013<em></em>describes a Web services protocol based
    on SOAP for use in managementâ€‘specific domains. These domains include the management
    of entities such as PCs, servers, devices, Web services and other applications
    manageable entities. Services can expose only a WS-Management interface or compose
    the WS-Management service interface with some of the many other Web service specifications.</p><p>A
    crucial application for these services is in the area of systems management. To
    promote interoperability between management applications and managed resources,
    ISO/IEC PAS 17963:2012 identifies a core set of Web service specifications and
    usage requirements that expose a common set of operations central to all systems
    management. This includes the ability to do the following:</p><p>a) get, put (update),
    create, and delete individual resource instances, such as settings and dynamic
    values;</p><p>b) enumerate the contents of containers and collections, such as
    large tables and logs;</p><p>c) subscribe to events emitted by managed resources;</p><p>d)
    execute specific management methods with strongly typed input and output parameters.</p><p>In
    each of these areas of scope, ISO/IEC 17963:2013 defines minimal implementation
    requirements for conformant Web service implementations. An implementation is
    free to extend beyond this set of operations, and to choose not to support one
    or more of the preceding areas of functionality if that functionality is not appropriate
    to the target device or system.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17963:2013 intends to meet the following
    requirements:</p><p>a) constrain Web services protocols and formats so that Web
    services can be implemented with a small footprint in both hardware and software
    management services;</p><p>b) define minimum requirements for compliance without
    constraining richer implementations;</p><p>c) ensure backward compatibility and
    interoperability with WS-Management version 1.0;</p><p>d) ensure composability
    with other Web services specifications.</p>"
