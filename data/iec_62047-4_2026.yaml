abstract:
- content: "IEC 62047-4:2026 describes generic specifications for micro-electromechanical
    systems (MEMS) made by semiconductors, which are the basis for specifications
    given in other parts of this series for various types of MEMS applications such
    as sensors, RF MEMS, optical MEMS, bio-MEMS, micro TAS, and power MEMS. This document
    specifies general procedures for quality assessment and establishes general principles
    for describing and testing of electrical, optical, mechanical and environmental
    characteristics. This part of IEC 62047 aids in the preparation of standards that
    define devices and systems made by micromachining technology, including but not
    limited to, material characterization and handling, assembly and testing, process
    control and measuring methods. MEMS described in this document are basically made
    of semiconductor material. However, the statements made in this document are also
    applicable to MEMS using materials other than semiconductor, for example, polymers,
    glass, metals and ceramic materials.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    in the Scope, optical MEMS, bio-MEMS, micro TAS, and power MEMS for various types
    of MEMS applications were included;<br />\r\nb) MEMS categories and terms in Table
    1 were slightly modified such consumer electronics and automotive were added that
    in application technology."
