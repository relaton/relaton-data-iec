abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2012 builds on the concepts presented in ISO/IEC
    TR 15443-1. It provides a discussion of the attributes of security assurance conformity
    assessment methods that contribute towards making assurance claims and providing
    assurance evidence to fulfil meeting the assurance requirements for a deliverable.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 15443-2:2012 proposes criteria for comparing and analysing different SACA methods.
    The reader is cautioned that the methods used as examples in ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2012
    are considered to represent popularly used methods at the time of its writing.
    New methods may appear, and modification or withdrawal of the methods cited may
    occur. It is intended that the criteria can be used to describe and compare any
    SACA method whatever its provenance.</p>"
