abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30107-4:2024 This document is a profile that specifies requirements
    for testing biometric presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms on mobile
    devices with local biometric recognition and on biometric modules integrated into
    mobile devices.<br />\r\nThe profile lists requirements from ISO/IEC 30107-3 that
    are specific to mobile devices. It also establishes requirements that are not
    present in ISO/IEC 30107-3. For each requirement, the profile defines an “Approach
    in PAD Tests for Mobile Devices”. For some requirements, numerical values or ranges
    are provided in the form of best practices.<br />\r\nThis profile is applicable
    to mobile devices that operate as closed systems with no access to internal results,
    including mobile devices with local biometric recognition as well as biometric
    modules for mobile devices.<br />\r\nThis document is not applicable to mobile
    devices with solely remote biometric recognition.<br />\r\nThe attacks considered
    in this document take place at the capture device during the presentation and
    collection of biometric characteristics. Any other attacks are outside the scope
    of this document."
