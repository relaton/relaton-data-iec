abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document is a profile that specifies requirements
    for testing biometric presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms on mobile
    devices with local biometric recognition and on biometric modules integrated into
    mobile devices.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The profile lists requirements from
    ISO/IEC 30107-3 that are specific to mobile devices. It also establishes requirements
    that are not present in ISO/IEC 30107-3. For each requirement, the profile defines
    an “Approach in PAD Tests for Mobile Devices”. For some requirements, numerical
    values or ranges are provided in the form of best practices.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    profile is applicable to mobile devices that operate as closed systems with no
    access to internal results, including mobile devices with local biometric recognition
    as well as biometric modules for mobile devices.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document is not applicable to mobile devices with solely remote biometric recognition.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">The attacks considered in this document take place at the
    capture device during the presentation and collection of biometric characteristics.
    Any other attacks are outside the scope of this document.</p>
