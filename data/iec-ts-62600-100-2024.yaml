  content: "IEC TS 62600-100:2024 applied in conjunction with the IEC Technical Specification
    on wave energy resource assessment and characterization (IEC TS 62600-101), provides
    a method for estimation of the mean annual energy production of a WEC, assessing
    the electrical power production performance of a single, non-array, wave energy
    converter, at Location 2 based on the performance at Location 1.<br />\r\nThe
    scope of this document includes:<br />\r\na) All wave energy converters that produce
    electrical power from wave energy.<br />\r\nb) All sea resource zones (near and
    offshore, deep and shallow water).<br />\r\nc) Capture width matrix transposition
    from one location to another.<br />\r\nd) Limitation on the changes that are allowed
    to the WEC and the specification of the location.<br />\r\ne) Wave data required
    at Location 2, as a minimum the requirements found in IEC TS 62600‑101.<br />\r\nf)
    Development of the capture width matrix at Location 2.<br />\r\ng) Validation
    of the capture width matrix at Location 2.<br />\r\nh) Assessment of uncertainties
    in the derived performance parameters at Location 2.<br />\r\ni) Requirements
    for the allowable power performance transfer by geometric, kinematic and dynamic
    similarity.<br />\r\nj) Requirements for the allowable incorporation of additional
    empirical model data.<br />\r\nk) Requirements for the allowable incorporation
    of additional numerical model data.<br />\r\nl) The document applies to commercial
    scale wave energy converters that are:<br />\r\n- compliantly moored.<br />\r\n-
    tautly moored.<br />\r\n- bottom mounted.<br />\r\n- shore mounted.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Incorporation of IEC TS 62600-102 as a series of
    annexes in this document.<br />\r\nb) Removal of the computation of annual energy
    production. This has been moved to IEC TS 62600-101.<br />\r\nc) Modification
    to the list of terms definitions, symbols and units.<br />\r\nd) Modification
    of the reporting section to align with IEC TS 62600-200."
