abstract:
- content: 'IEC TS 62325-503:2014(E) is a technical specification intended for European
    electricity markets, and specifies a communication platform which every Transmission
    System Operator (TSO) in Europe may use to reliably and securely exchange documents
    for the energy market. Consequently a European market participant (trader, distribution
    utilities, etc.) could benefit from a single, common, harmonized and secure platform
    for message exchange with the different TSOs; thus reducing the cost of building
    different IT platforms to interface with all the parties involved. This also represents
    an important step in facilitating parties entering into markets other than their
    national ones. Keyword: deregulation of energy market'
