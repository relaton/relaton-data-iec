    <p>ISO/IEC 16512-2:2011 specifies the relayed multicast protocol for simplex group applications (RMCP-2), an application-layer protocol, which constructs a multicast tree for data delivery from one sender to multiple receivers over the Internet where IP multicast is not fully deployed.</p>
    <p>It defines a basic RMCP-2 protocol without security features, and a secure RMCP-2 protocol that adds security features to the basic protocol. Both protocols specify a series of functions and procedures for multicast agents to construct a one-to-many relayed data path and to relay simplex data. They also specify the operations of the session manager to manage multicast sessions.</p>
    <p>These protocols can be used for applications that require one-to-many data delivery services, such as multimedia streaming services or file dissemination services.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 16512-2:2011 also defines a membership authentication procedure for use with the secure RMCP-2 protocol and provides informative material related to the protocols.  </p>
