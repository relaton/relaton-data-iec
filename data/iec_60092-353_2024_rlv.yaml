abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-353:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60092-353:2024
    is applicable to shipboard and offshore non radial field power cables with extruded
    solid insulation, having a voltage rating of 0,6/1 (1,2) kV or 1,8/3 (3,6) kV
    intended for fixed installations. Cables designed to maintain circuit integrity
    during a fire are included. The various types of power cables are given in 5.1.
    The constructional requirements and test methods are aligned with those indicated
    in IEC 60092-350, unless otherwise specified in this document.<br />\r\nThe object
    of this document is:<br />\r\n- to standardize cables whose safety and reliability
    is ensured when they are installed in accordance with the requirements of IEC
    60092-352 or IEC 61892-4,<br />\r\n- to lay down standard manufacturing requirements
    and characteristics of such cables directly or indirectly bearing on safety, and<br
    />\r\n- to specify test methods for checking conformity with those requirements.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Updated references to IEC 60092-350 for general construction and test
    methods and IEC 60092-360 for insulating and sheathing materials.<br />\r\nb)
    Added subclause 5.10: Construction for special applications.<br />\r\nc) Added
    Table 9: Additional test for cables for installation between areas with and without
    explosive atmospheres.<br />\r\nd) Deleted the test requirement IEC 60331-21 from
    Table 7.<br />\r\ne) Deleted the former Annex A (Alternative enhanced insulation
    thickness for 0,6/1 kV)."
