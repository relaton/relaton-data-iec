abstract:
- content: "IEC 61854:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61854:2020
    applies to spacers for conductor bundles of overhead lines. It covers rigid spacers,
    flexible spacers and spacer dampers.<br />\r\nIt does not apply to interphase
    spacers, hoop spacers and bonding spacers.<br />\r\nThis document is written to
    cover the line design practices and spacers most commonly used at the time of
    writing. There may be other spacers available for which the specific tests reported
    in this document may not be applicable.<br />\r\nIn some cases, test procedures
    and test values are left to agreement between purchaser and supplier and are stated
    in the procurement contract. The purchaser is best able to evaluate the intended
    service conditions, which should be the basis for establishing the test severity.<br
    />\r\nIn Annex A, the minimum technical details to be agreed between purchaser
    and supplier are listed.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 1998. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Consider the application of spacers on high
    temperature conductors specifying additional high temperature tests in clamp slip
    tests and for the characterization of elastic and damping properties;<br />\r\nb)
    Specify as far as possible test parameters and acceptance values;<br />\r\nc)
    Avoid as far as possible the alternative procedures for the same test;<br />\r\nd)
    Introduce a simpler test device for the simulated short circuit current test;<br
    />\r\ne) Introduce test at low temperature on fastener components such as break
    away bolts and conical spring washers;<br />\r\nf) Prescribe a different procedure
    for subspan oscillation tests on spacers equipped with clamps having rod attachments;<br
    />\r\ng) Modify the test procedure for the aeolian vibration tests;<br />\r\nh)
    Prescribe a different procedure for aeolian vibration tests on spacers equipped
    with clamps having rod attachments;<br />\r\ni) Re-edit all the figures in order
    to make them more clear and homogeneous;<br />\r\nj) Introduce an additional test
    device for the simulated short circuit current test.<br />\r\nKey words: Overhead
    Lines, Spacers"
