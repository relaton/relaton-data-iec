abstract:
- content: This PAS defines certain dimensional limits that an angled PC end-face
    multi-fibre rectangular ferrule having two guide-holes for positioning two alignment
    pins and using a thermoset material with a Young's modulus of 20-25 GPa has to
    meet in order to comply with specific requirements for interconnections. Ferrules
    made from the material specified in this PAS are suitable for use in category
    C as defined in IEC 61753-1. A PAS is a technical specification not fulfilling
    the requirements for a standard but made available to the public.
