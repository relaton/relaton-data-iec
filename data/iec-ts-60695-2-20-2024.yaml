  content: "IEC TS 60695-2-20:2024, which is a technical specification, describes
    a test method that applies to solid electrical insulating materials of which test
    specimens can be provided. The test measures the time required to ignite a test
    specimen when it is affected by heat from an electrically heated wire wound around
    the test specimen. The test method can be used to provide classifications which
    can be used for quality assurance, the preselection of materials of products as
    described in IEC 60695-1-30, or to verify the required minimum classification
    of materials used in end products. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the
    third edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\nRemoved all text which was related to drip or
    dripping, since in this 4th edition only ignition is taken into consideration
    for determination of the classification level;<br />\r\nTitle changed: \"Hot wire
    coil test method\" is now \"Hot wire ignition (HWI) test method\"."
