  content: "IEC 61300-3-7:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV describes methods available to measure
    the wavelength dependence of attenuation and return loss of two-port, single mode
    passive optical components. It is not, however, applicable to dense wavelength
    division multiplexing (DWDM) devices. Measurement methods of wavelength dependence
    of attenuation of DWDM devices are described in IEC 61300-3-29. There are two
    measurement cases described in this document:<br />\r\na) measurement of attenuation
    only;<br />\r\nb) measurement of attenuation and return loss at the same time.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) reduction of the number of alternative methods proposed to bring in-line
    with industry practice;<br />\r\nb) re-statement of the equations for insertion
    loss and return loss using logarithmic forms more common in the industry;<br />\r\nc)
    additional recommendations with respect to the creation of fibre terminations;<br
    />\r\nd) additional discussion on the characterization of the optical sources
    used in this document;<br />\r\ne) simplification of bi-directional testing;<br
    />\r\nf) removal of separate return loss only measurement procedures."
