abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 7816-15:2016 specifies an application in a card. This application
    contains information on cryptographic functionality. This part of ISO/IEC 7816
    defines a common syntax and format for the cryptographic information and mechanisms
    to share this information whenever appropriate.<p>The objectives of this part
    of ISO/IEC 7816 are to</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tfacilitate interoperability among components
    running on various platforms (platform neutral),\r\n\tenable applications in the
    outside world to take advantage of products and components from multiple manufacturers
    (vendor neutral),\r\n\tenable the use of advances in technology without rewriting
    application-level software (application neutral), and\r\n\tmaintain consistency
    with existing, related standards while expanding upon them only where necessary
    and practical.<p>It supports the following capabilities:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\tstorage
    of multiple instances of cryptographic information in a card;\r\n\tuse of the
    cryptographic information;\r\n\tretrieval of the cryptographic information, a
    key factor for this is the notion of \"Directory Files\", which provides a layer
    of indirection between objects on the card and the actual format of these objects;\r\n\tcross-referencing
    of the cryptographic information with DOs defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 7816
    when appropriate;\r\n\tdifferent authentication mechanisms;\r\n\tmultiple cryptographic
    algorithms (the suitability of these is outside the scope of this part of ISO/IEC
    7816).<p>ISO/IEC 7816-15.2016 does not cover the internal implementation within
    the card and/or the outside world. It is not mandatory for implementations complying
    with this International Standard to support all options described.</p><p>In case
    of discrepancies between ASN.1 definitions in the body of the text and the module
    in Annex A, Annex A takes precedence.</p>"
