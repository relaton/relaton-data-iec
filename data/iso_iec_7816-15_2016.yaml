abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 7816-15:2016 specifies an application in a card. This application
    contains information on cryptographic functionality. This part of ISO/IEC 7816
    defines a common syntax and format for the cryptographic information and mechanisms
    to share this information whenever appropriate.</p><p>The objectives of this part
    of ISO/IEC 7816 are to</p><ul><li>- facilitate interoperability among components
    running on various platforms (platform neutral),</li><li>- enable applications
    in the outside world to take advantage of products and components from multiple
    manufacturers (vendor neutral),</li><li>- enable the use of advances in technology
    without rewriting application-level software (application neutral), and</li><li>-
    maintain consistency with existing, related standards while expanding upon them
    only where necessary and practical.</li></ul><p>It supports the following capabilities:</p><ul><li>-
    storage of multiple instances of cryptographic information in a card;</li><li>-
    use of the cryptographic information;</li><li>- retrieval of the cryptographic
    information, a key factor for this is the notion of "Directory Files", which provides
    a layer of indirection between objects on the card and the actual format of these
    objects;</li><li>- cross-referencing of the cryptographic information with DOs
    defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 7816 when appropriate;</li><li>- different authentication
    mechanisms;</li><li>- multiple cryptographic algorithms (the suitability of these
    is outside the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 7816).</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 7816-15.2016
    does not cover the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside
    world. It is not mandatory for implementations complying with this International
    Standard to support all options described.</p><p>In case of discrepancies between
    ASN.1 definitions in the body of the text and the module in Annex A, Annex A takes
    precedence.</p>
