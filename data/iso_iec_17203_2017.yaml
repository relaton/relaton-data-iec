abstract:
- content: "<p>The<em>Open Virtualization Format (OVF) Specification</em>describes
    an open, secure, efficient and</p><p>extensible format for the packaging and distribution
    of software to be run in virtual systems.</p><p>The OVF package enables the authoring
    of portable virtual systems and the transport of virtual</p><p>systems between
    virtualization platforms. This version of the specification (2.1) is intended
    to allow</p><p>OVF 1.x tools to work with OVF 2.x descriptors in the following
    sense:</p><p>Existing OVF 1.x tools should be able to parse OVF 2.x descriptors.</p><p>Existing
    OVF 1.x tools should be able to give warnings/errors if dependencies to 2.x</p><p>
    features are required for correct operation.</p><p>If a conflict arises between
    the schema, text, or tables, the order of precedence to resolve the conflicts</p><p>is
    schema; then text; then tables. Figures are for illustrative purposes only and
    are not a normative</p><p>part of the standard.</p><p>A table may constrain the
    text but it shall not conflict with it.</p><p>The profile conforms to the cited
    CIM Schema classes where used. Any requirements contained in the</p><p>cited CIM
    Schema classes shall be met. If a conflict arises the CIM Schema takes precedence.</p><p>The
    profile conforms to the cited OVF XML Schema. It may constrain the schema but
    it shall not</p><p>conflict with it. If a conflict arises the OVF XML Schema takes
    precedence.</p>"
