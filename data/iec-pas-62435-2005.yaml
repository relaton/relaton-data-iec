  content: "This PAS applies to the long-duration storage of electronic components.\n\nAlthough
    it has always existed to some extent, obsolescence of electronic components, and
    particularly integrated circuits, has become increasingly intense over the last
    few years. Indeed, with the existing technological boom, the commercial life of
    a component has become very short compared with the life of industrial equipment
    such as those encountered in the aeronautical field, the railway industry or the
    energy sector.\n\nThe many solutions enabling obsolescence to be resolved are
    now identified. However, selecting one of these solutions must be preceded by
    a case-by-case technical and economic feasibility study, depending on whether
    storage is envisaged for field service or production, for example: \n- remedial
    storage as soon as components are no longer marketed\n- preventive storage anticipating
    declaration of obsolescence\n\nTaking into account the expected life of some installations,
    sometimes covering several decades, the qualification times, and the unavailability
    costs, which can also be very high, the solution to be adopted to resolve obsolescence
    must often be rapidly implemented. This is why the solution retained in most cases
    consists in systematically storing components which are in the process of becoming
    obsolescent.\n\nThe technical risks of this solution are, a priori, fairly low.
    However, it requires the perfect mastery of the implemented process, and especially
    of the storage environment, although this mastery becomes critical when it comes
    to long-term storage. All handling, protection, storage and test operations must
    be performed according to the state of the art."
