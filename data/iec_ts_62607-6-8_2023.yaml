abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-8:2023 establishes a method to determine the key control
    characteristic sheet resistance RS [measured in ohm per square (Ω/sq)], by the
    in-line four-point probe method, 4PP.<br />\r\nThe sheet resistance RS is derived
    by measurements of four-terminal electrical resistance performed on four electrodes
    placed on the surface of the planar sample.<br />\r\nThe measurement range for
    RS of the graphene samples with the method described in this document goes from
    10−2 Ω/sq to 104 Ω/sq.<br />\r\nThe method is applicable for CVD graphene provided
    it is transferred to quartz substrates or other insulating materials (quartz,
    SiO2 on Si, as well as graphene grown from silicon carbide.<br />\r\nThe method
    is complementary to the van der Pauw method (IEC 62607-6-7) for what concerns
    the measurement of the sheet resistance and can be useful when it is not possible
    to reliably place contacts on the sample boundary."
