  content: IEC TS 62996:2017(E) addresses the safety assessments in the frequency
    range between 1 kHz and 6 MHz and provides limits for touch and touch currents
    for industrial installations or equipment for electroheating (EH) and electromagnetic
    processing of materials (EPM). Indirect contact by capacitive currents to parts
    of an earthed human body in an open space are also included, since the current
    is then distributed analogously in the part of the body and differs from cases
    of induced electric shock.
