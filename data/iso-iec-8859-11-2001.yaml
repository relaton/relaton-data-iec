    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 183</p>
    <p>coded graphic characters identified as Latin/Thai</p>
    <p>alphabet.</p>
    <p>This set of coded graphic characters is intended for</p>
    <p>use in data and text processing applications and</p>
    <p>also for information interchange.</p>
    <p>The set contains graphic characters used for general</p>
    <p>purpose applications in typical office environments in</p>
    <p>at least the following languages:</p>
    <p>Thai, English and Latin.</p>
    <p>Some of the characters in this set are combining</p>
    <p>characters (see clause 6).</p>
    <p>This set of coded graphic characters may be</p>
    <p>regarded as a version of an 8-bit code according to</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in</p>
    <p>conjunction with any other parts of ISO/IEC 8859. If</p>
    <p>coded characters from more than one part are to be</p>
    <p>used together, by means of code extension</p>
    <p>techniques, the equivalent coded character sets</p>
    <p>from ISO/IEC 10367 or their corresponding G1 sets</p>
    <p>from ?ISO International Register of Coded Character</p>
    <p>Sets to be used with escape sequences', should be</p>
    <p>used instead within a version of ISO/IEC 4873 at</p>
    <p>level 2 or level 3.</p>
    <p>The coded characters in this set may be used in</p>
    <p>conjunction with coded control functions selected</p>
    <p>from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions are</p>
    <p>not used to create composite graphic symbols from</p>
    <p>two or more graphic characters (see clause 6).</p>
    <p><b>NOTE </b>? ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for use with</p>
    <p>Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information coded</p>
    <p>according to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such</p>
    <p>services, it will have to conform to the requirements of</p>
    <p>those services at the access-point.</p>
