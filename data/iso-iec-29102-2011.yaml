    <p>ISO/IEC 29102:2011 provides a method to determine the ink cartridge photo yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink cartridges without integrated print heads) for colour photo printing with colour inkjet printers and multi-function devices that contain inkjet printer components. Ink cartridge yields determined on one printer model, paper and cartridge configuration are not applicable to another printer model or cartridge configuration even if the ink jet cartridges used in testing are the same.</p>
    <p>It prescribes the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the test method that manufacturers, test labs, etc. use to determine ink cartridge photo yield;</li>
    <li>the method for determination of declared photo yield values from the test results; and</li>
    <li>the appropriate method of describing the photo yield of cartridges in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer.</li>
    </ul>
