abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61289:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 61289:2019
    contains guidelines for medical and nursing personnel regarding the safe and effective
    operation of HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT and HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL ACCESSORIES
    (also referred to as HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT in this document). It is also of use
    to scientific/technical staff who have responsibility for the maintenance of this
    equipment. The application guidelines in this document deal with the safe operation
    of HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT constructed according to the safety requirements
    of IEC 60601-1 and IEC 60601-2-2. Not all existing HIGH FREQUENCY SURGICAL EQUIPMENT
    meets the minimum requirements of current international standards, however, the
    guidelines in this document is still helpful in utilizing these devices. IEC TR
    61289:2019 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2011. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) general adaption
    to IEC 60601-2-2:2017;<br />\r\nb) refinement and additions to the defined terms;<br
    />\r\nc) separation of HF SURGICAL EQUIPMENT and HF SURGICAL ACCESSORIES;<br />\r\nd)
    consideration of the HIGH CURRENT MODE;<br />\r\ne) update of symbols."
