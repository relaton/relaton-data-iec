    <p>This document concerns processes and capabilities of methods and tools for organizational management for a family of products, not for a single system.</p>
    <p>NOTE       System Architecture is a set of logical and physical principles used to achieve a mission within a given environment. Components that can be subsystems derived from System Architecture are: software products, human-based products such as crew or operators, or hardware products like mechanical structures, electronic boards and chemicals. The scope of this document spans from the system to subsystems and components. Both hardware-intensive and software-intensive systems are included, if they are part of a product family.</p>
