abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15444-4:2024 This document1 specifies the framework, concepts,
    methodology for testing, and criteria to be achieved to claim compliance to Rec.
    ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 or Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15. It provides
    a framework for specifying abstract test suites (ATSs) and for defining the procedures
    to be followed during compliance testing.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n- specifies
    compliance testing procedures for encoding and decoding using Rec. ITU-T T.800
    | ISO/IEC 15444-1 and Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15;<br />\r\n- specifies
    codestreams, decoded images, and error metrics to be used with the testing procedures;<br
    />\r\n- specifies ATSs;<br />\r\n- provides guidance for creating an encoder compliance
    test.<br />\r\nThis document does not include the following tests:<br />\r\nAcceptance
    testing: the process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance
    criteria and enables the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation.
    This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g., functionality,
    quality, and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation
    satisfies the user requirements.<br />\r\nPerformance testing: measures the performance
    characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT) such as its throughput and
    responsiveness, under various conditions.<br />\r\nRobustness testing: the process
    of determining how well an implementation processes data which contains errors.<br
    />\r\n1 this document includes an electronic attachment with the codestreams used
    in the application of the procedures described the Specification."
