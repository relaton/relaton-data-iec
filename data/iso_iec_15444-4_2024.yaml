abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoNormal">This document1 specifies the framework, concepts,
    methodology for testing, and criteria to be achieved to claim compliance to Rec.
    ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 or Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15. It provides
    a framework for specifying abstract test suites (ATSs) and for defining the procedures
    to be followed during compliance testing.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This document:</p><p
    class="enumlev1">‒ specifies compliance testing procedures for encoding and decoding
    using Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 and Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15;</p><p
    class="enumlev1">‒ specifies codestreams, decoded images, and error metrics to
    be used with the testing procedures;</p><p class="enumlev1">‒ specifies ATSs;</p><p
    class="enumlev1">‒ provides guidance for creating an encoder compliance test.</p><p
    class="MsoNormal">This document does not include the following tests:</p><p class="MsoNormal">Acceptance
    testing: the process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance
    criteria and enables the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation.
    This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g., functionality,
    quality, and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation
    satisfies the user requirements.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Performance testing:
    measures the performance characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT)
    such as its throughput and responsiveness, under various conditions.</p><p>Robustness
    testing: the process of determining how well an implementation processes data
    which contains errors.</p><!--[endif]--><p class="MsoFootnoteText" style="margin-left:
