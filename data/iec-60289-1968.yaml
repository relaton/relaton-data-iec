  content: 'This standard applies to the following types of reactors: shunt reactors,
    current-limiting reactors including neutral-earthing reactors, damping reactors,
    tuning (filter) reactors, earthing transformers (neutral couplers), arc-suppression
    reactors, smoothing reactors, with the exception of the following reactors: small
    reactors with a rating generally less than 2 kvar single-phase and 10 kvar three-phase,
    reactors for special purposes such as high-frequency line traps or reactors mounted
    on rolling stock.'
