abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62351-10:2012(E) targets the description of security architecture
    guidelines for power systems based on essential security controls, i.e. on security-related
    components and functions and their interaction. Furthermore, the relation and
    mapping of these security controls to the general system architecture of power
    systems is provided as a guideline to support system integrators to securely deploy
    power generation, transmission, and distribution systems applying available standards.
