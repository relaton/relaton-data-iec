abstract:
- content: <p>The purpose of this part of ISO/IEC 16500 is to specify normative protocols
    and associated dynamic system</p><p>behavior, including session and connection
    manipulation, configuration and download, for an ISO/IEC 16500</p><p>system. The
    emphasis is on the significant dynamic system entities (e.g., session control,
    call/connection</p><p>control), the behavior of these entities (e.g., information
    flows, entity actions, parameters passed) and the</p><p>allowable physical placement(s)
    of these entities in a DAVIC system (i.e., physical instances). As such, this</p><p>part
    of ISO/IEC 16500 complements the static systems reference model described in ISO/IEC
    16500-1,</p><p>specifying normative dynamic behavior as well as specifying the
    protocol(s) required to realize this behavior.</p><p>The protocols themselves
    are specified primarily through the use of "Protocol Network Architecture"</p><p>diagrams
    which visually illustrate, for each of the defined physical instances and application
    scenarios, the</p><p>various protocol stacks which are to be used. Detailed specification
    of the individual protocol tools</p><p>themselves (e.g., the detailed protocol
    messages used to realize the DAVIC dynamic flow behavior) is</p><p>provided in
    ISO/IEC 16500-5 (mid- and higher layers) and ISO/IEC 16500-4 (lower layers) of
    this</p><p>specification.</p><p>This results in instance specifications made up
    of building blocks from the DAVIC tool set organized in a</p><p>manner describing
    a system which performs DAVIC functions.</p>
