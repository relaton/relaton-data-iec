    <p>This document defines test methods for characteristics of integrated circuit cards with contacts and related interface devices according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7816-3. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 that defines the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.</p>
    <p>NOTE       Criteria for acceptability do not form part of this document but can be found in the International Standards mentioned above.</p>
    <p>This document defines test methods which are specific to integrated circuit technology with contacts. ISO/IEC 10373-1 defines test methods which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts of the ISO/IEC 10373 series define other technology‑specific tests.</p>
    <p>Test methods defined in this document are intended to be performed separately and independently. A given card is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially. The test methods defined in this document are based on ISO/IEC 7816-3.</p>
    <p>Conformance of cards and IFDs determined using the test methods defined in this document does not preclude failures in the field. Reliability testing is outside the scope of this document.</p>
    <p>This document does not define any test to establish the complete functioning of integrated circuit cards. The test methods require only that the minimum functionality be verified. The minimum functionality is defined as follows.</p>
    <p>—          Any integrated circuit present in the card continues to show an Answer to Reset response which conforms to the base standard.</p>
    <p>—          Any contacts associated with any integrated circuit present in the card continue to show electrical resistance which conforms to the base standard.</p>
