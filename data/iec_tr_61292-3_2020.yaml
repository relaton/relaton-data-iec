    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tdocument architecture
    now focuses on EDFA, FRA and SOA;\r\n\tthe description of PDFA and TDFA has been
    moved to the annexes;\r\n\tthe EDWA description has been deleted;\r\n\tinformation
    on single channel amplification, multi-channel amplification, configuration and
