abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9798-6:2005 specifies four entity authentication mechanisms based
    on manual data transfer between authenticating devices. Such mechanisms may be
    appropriate in a variety of circumstances. One such application occurs in Personal
    Area Networks, where the owner of two personal devices capable of wireless communications
    wishes them to perform an entity authentication procedure as part of the process
    of preparing them for use in the network. These mechanisms may also be used to
    support key management functions.ISO/IEC 9798-6:2005 specifies mechanisms in which
    entity authentication is achieved bymanually transferring short data strings from
    one device to the other, ormanually comparing short data strings output by the
    two devices.In ISO/IEC 9798-6:2005, the meaning of the term entity authentication
    is different to the meaning applied in other parts of ISO/IEC 9798. Instead of
    one device verifying that the other device has a claimed identity (and vice versa),
    both devices in possession of a user verify that they correctly share a data string
    with the other device at the time of execution of the mechanism. Of course, this
    data string could contain identifiers for one or both of the devices.
