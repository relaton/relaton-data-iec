abstract:
- content: "IEC 62994:2019 specifies definitions of terms and introduces evaluation
    methods for EH&S risk assessment for the PV module over the product life cycle.
    Environmental health and safety (EH&S) risk assessment is a method to characterize
    and evaluate potential adverse impacts to human health or environment and make
    it possible to take measures to reduce them. EH&S risk assessment of PV modules
    is very important for the safe and sustainable manufacture, use, and end of life
    treatment of PV modules. The definition of terms can be applied to the EH&S risk
    assessment through the life cycle of PV modules. Generally, evaluation methods
    for the EH&S risk assessment can be divided in two cases:<br />\r\n- ordinary
    foreseen routine operation, in which life cycle assessment method is applied;<br
    />\r\n- abnormal non-routine operation, in which risk assessment method is applied"
