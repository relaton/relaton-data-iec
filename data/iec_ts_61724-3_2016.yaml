abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61724-3:2016(E) defines a procedure for measuring and analyzing
    the energy production of a specific photovoltaic system relative to expected electrical
    energy production for the same system from actual weather conditions as defined
    by the stakeholders of the test. The energy production is characterized specifically
    for times when the system is operating (available); times when the system is not
    operating (unavailable) are quantified as part of an availability metric. The
    aim of this technical specification is to define a procedure for comparing the
    measured electrical energy with the expected electrical energy of the PV system.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of February 2018 have been included in this
    copy."
