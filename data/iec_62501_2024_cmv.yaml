abstract:
- content: "IEC 62501:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62501:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62501:2009+AMD1:2014+AMD2:2017
    CSV edition 1.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 22F experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62501:2024 applies to self-commutated converter valves,
    for use in a three-phase bridge voltage sourced converter (VSC) for high voltage
    DC power transmission or as part of a back-to-back link, and to dynamic braking
    valves. It is restricted to electrical type and production tests. This document
    can be used as a guide for testing of high-voltage VSC valves used in energy storage
    systems (ESS). The tests specified in this document are based on air insulated
    valves. The test requirements and acceptance criteria can be used for guidance
    to specify the electrical type and production tests of other types of valves.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Conditions for use of evidence in lieu are
    inserted as a new Table 1;<br />\r\nb) Test parameters for valve support DC voltage
    test, 7.3.2, and MVU DC voltage test, 8.4.1, updated;<br />\r\nc) AC-DC voltage
    test between valve terminals, Clause 9, is restructured and alternative tests,
    by individual AC and DC voltage tests, added in 9.4.2;<br />\r\nd) Partial discharge
    test in routine test program is removed;<br />\r\ne) More information on valve
    component fault tolerance, Annex B, is added;<br />\r\nf) Valve losses determination
    is added as Annex C."
