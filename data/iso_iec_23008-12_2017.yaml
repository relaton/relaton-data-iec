abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23008-12:2017 enable the interchange, editing, and display of
    images, as well as the carriage of metadata associated with those images.<br />\r\nThe
    Image File Format builds on tools defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 to define an interoperable
    storage format for a single image, a collection of images, and sequences of images.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 23008-12:2017 specifies brands for the storage of images and image
    sequences conforming to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC).<br />\r\nNOTE The
    storage of HEVC video sequences is out of scope and is handled by ISO/IEC 14496â€‘15.<br
    />\r\nThis format defines normative structures used to contain metadata, how to
    link that metadata to the images, and defines how metadata of certain forms is
    carried."
