abstract:
- content: IEC 61196-1-123:2023 defines the test method to determine the attenuation
    constant of radiating coaxial communication cables that are intended for use in
    wireless communication systems such as tunnels, railways, highways, subways, elevators
    and other confined areas in which conventional antenna transmission is not satisfactory
    or even impossible.
