    This document describes a standardized method to assess the energy efficiency
    of commercial storage products in both active and idle states of operation. A
    taxonomy is defined that classifies storage products in terms of operational profiles
    and supported features. Test definition and execution rules for measuring the
    power efficiency of each taxonomy category are described; these include test sequence,
    test configuration, instrumentation, benchmark driver, IO profiles, measurement
    interval, and metric stability assessment. Qualitative heuristic tests are defined
    to verify the existence of several capacity optimization methods. Resulting power
    efficiency metrics are defined as ratios of idle capacity or active operations
    during a selected stable measurement interval to the average measured power."
