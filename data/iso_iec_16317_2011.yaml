    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    16317:2011 specifies maintenance of network connectivity and presence by proxies
    to extend the sleep duration of hosts.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 16317:2011 specifies:\r\n\r\n\tcapabilities
    that a proxy may expose to a host;\r\n\tinformation that must be exchanged between
    a host and a proxy;\r\n\tproxy behaviour for 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11 (WiFi);\r\n\trequired
    and optional behaviour of a proxy while it is operating, including responding
    to packets, generating packets, ignoring packets, and waking the host.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC
    16317:2011 does not:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tspecify communication mechanisms between hosts
    and proxies;\r\n\textend or modify the referenced specifications (and for any
    discrepancies those specifications are authoritative);\r\n\tsupport security and
    communication protocols such as IPsec, MACSec, SSL, TLS, Mobile IP, etc."
