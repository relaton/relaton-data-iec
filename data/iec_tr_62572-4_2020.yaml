abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62572-4:2020, which is a Technical Report, provides guidelines
    for optical connector end-face cleaning methods for receptacle style optical transceivers.
    It includes details about handling receptacle style optical transceivers, internal
    structures of optical transceivers, information on cleaning tools and machines,
    applicable cleaning methods, and cleaning procedures. Receptacle style optical
    transceivers as well as optical fibre patch cords are handled by operators and
    maintenance staff of optical network systems. This document can be used as a guideline
    to prepare instruction manuals for the operators and maintenance staff of optical
    network systems. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- addition of terms and definitions on multifibre connector interface optical
    transceivers;<br />\r\n- addition of cleaning methods for multifibre connector
    interface type optical transceivers;<br />\r\n- updating URLs for reference websites."
