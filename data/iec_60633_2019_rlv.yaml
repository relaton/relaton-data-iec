abstract:
- content: "IEC 60633:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 6033:2019 defines terms
    for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission systems and for HVDC
    substations using electronic power converters for the conversion from AC to DC
    or vice versa. This document is applicable to HVDC substations with line commutated
    converters, most commonly based on three-phase bridge (double way) connections
    (see Figure 2) in which unidirectional electronic valves, for example semiconductor
    valves, are used. For the thyristor valves, only the most important definitions
    are included in this document. A more comprehensive list of HVDC valve terminology
    is given in IEC 60700-2. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- 40 terms and definitions
    have been amended and 31 new terms and definitions have been added mainly on converter
    units and valves, converter operating conditions, HVDC systems and substations
    and HVDC substation equipment;<br />\r\n- a new Figure 13 on capacitor commutated
    converter configurations has been added.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of February 2020 have been included in this copy.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"></ol>"
