abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 17021:2011 contains principles and requirements for the competence,
    consistency and impartiality of the audit and certification of management systems
    of all types (e.g. quality management systems or environmental management systems)
    and for bodies providing these activities. Certification bodies operating to ISO/IEC
    17021:2011 need not offer all types of management system certification.<br /><br
    />\r\nCertification of management systems is a third-party conformity assessment
    activity. Bodies performing this activity are therefore third-party conformity
    assessment bodies.<br /><br />\r\nNEW! Free online tutorial on ISO/IEC 17021 ed2.0
    is now available."
