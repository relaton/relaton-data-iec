  content: <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document describes a set
    of useful activities, tasks, methods, and practices that acquirers of software
    and related services from unrelated (external) suppliers can apply to help ensure
    an efficient and effective acquisition of software or software services. These
    practices can be applied in competitive and in sole source procurements, regardless
    of the type, size, complexity, and cost of the acquisition. The document can be
    applied to software that runs on any computer system regardless of its size, complexity,
    or criticality. The software supply chain can include integration of off-the-shelf
    (OTS), custom, software as a service (SaaS), or open-source software. Software
    services can include software development and sustainment (maintenance), integration,
    verification (testing) and operation. Security and safety are included as attributes
    to be considered during the acquisition. However, specific requirements for acquisition
    of information assurance (security), safety, and cloud services are not included.</span></p>
