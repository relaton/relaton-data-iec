abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63134:2020+AMD1:2022 identifies AAL scenarios and use cases based
    on real-world applications and requirements. The use cases provide a practical
    context for considerations of interoperability and standards based on user experience.
    Use cases provide a context for utilizing existing standards and identifying further
    standardization work. User requirements have also been identified. This document
    also highlights potential areas for standardization in the AAL environment to
    ensure safety, security, privacy, ease of operation, performance and interoperability.
    Lastly, this document is a contribution to the IEC use case management repository,
    the purpose of which is to collect, administer, maintain, and analyse use cases.
