abstract:
- content: "IEC 62442-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62442-1:2018
    defines a measurement and calculation method of the total input power for controlgear-lamp
    circuits when operating with their associated fluorescent lamp(s). The calculation
    method for the efficiency of the lamp controlgear is also defined. This document
    applies to electrical controlgear-lamp circuits consisting only of the controlgear
    and the lamp(s). It is intended for use on DC supplies up to 1 000 V and/or AC
    supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision
    and has been harmonized with IEC 62442-2 and IEC 62442Â­3."
