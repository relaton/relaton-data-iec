abstract:
- content: "IEC 62056-3-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62056-3-1:2021
    describes two sets of profiles: the first set of profiles allows a bidirectional
    communication between a client and a server. This set of profiles is made of three
    profiles allowing local bus data exchange with stations either energized or not.
    For non-energized stations, the bus supplies energy for data exchange. Three different
    profiles are supported:<br />\r\n• base profile: this three-layer profile provides
    remote communication services;<br />\r\nNOTE 1 This first profile was published
    in IEC 61142:1993 and became known as the Euridis standard.<br />\r\n• profile
    with DLMS: this profile allows using DLMS services as specified in IEC 61334 4
    41;<br />\r\nNOTE 2 This second profile was published in IEC 62056-31:1999.<br
    />\r\n• profile with DLMS/COSEM: this profile allows using the DLMS/COSEM Application
    layer and the COSEM object model as specified in IEC 62056 5 3 and in IEC 62056
    6 2 respectively.<br />\r\nThe three profiles use the same physical layer and
    they are fully compatible, meaning that devices implementing any of these profiles
    can be operated on the same bus. The transmission medium is twisted pair using
    carrier signalling and it is known as the Euridis Bus.<br />\r\nThe second set
    of profiles allows unidirectional communication between a given Energy Metering
    device and a Customer Energy Management System. This second set is made up of
    three profiles.<br />\r\nSubclause 4.2.1 to Clause 8 included specify the bidirectional
    communication using twisted pair signalling and Clause 9 to 9.5 the unidirectional
    communication using twisted pair signalling.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition of IEC 62056-3-1, issued in 2013, and constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThe main technical changes with regard to the previous
    edition are as follows:<br />\r\n• addition of a profile which makes use of the
    IEC 62056 DLMS/COSEM Application layer and COSEM object model;<br />\r\n• review
    of the data link layer which is split into two parts:<br />\r\n– a pure Data Link
    layer;<br />\r\n– a \"Support Manager\" entity managing the communication media;<br
    />\r\n• ability to negotiate the communication speed, bringing baud rate up to
    9 600 bauds."
