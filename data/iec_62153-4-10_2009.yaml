abstract:
- content: IEC 62153-4-10:2009(E) details a coaxial method suitable for determining
    the transfer impedance and/or screening attenuation of feed-throughs and electromagnetic
    gaskets. A wide dynamic and frequency range can be applied to test even super
    screened feed throughs and gaskets with normal instrumentation from low frequencies
    up to the limit of defined transversal waves in the coaxial circuits at approximately
    4 GHz.
