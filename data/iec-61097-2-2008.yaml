  content: Specifies the minimum performance requirements, technical characteristics
    and type-testing requirements of the satellite emergency position-indicating radio
    beacon used in the COSPAS-SARSAT satellite system (satellite EPIRB), as required
    by the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS). Is associated
    with IEC 60945 and incorporates the performance standards of the relevant IMO
    Resolutions and ITU Regulations. Significant changes in this third edition include
    revised characteristics for the low duty cycle light, together with a revised
    test to allow the use of white LEDs. Other requirements have been clarified or
    revised as well.
