  content: "IEC 63241-3-9: 2025 applies to transportable mitre saws intended to cut
    wood or wood-based materials.<br />\r\nThis document is to be used in conjunction
    with the first edition of IEC 63241-1:2023.<br />\r\nThis document supplements
    or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 63241-1, so as to convert it into
    the IEC Standard: Particular requirements for transportable mitre saws.<br />\r\nWhere
    a particular subclause of IEC 63241-1 is not mentioned in this document, that
    subclause applies as far as reasonable. Where this document states \"addition\",
    \"modification\" or \"replacement\", the relevant text in IEC 63241-1 is to be
    adapted accordingly.<br />\r\nThe following print types are used:<br />\r\n- requirements:
    in roman type;<br />\r\n- test specifications: in italic type;<br />\r\n- notes:
    in small roman type.<br />\r\nThe terms defined in Clause 3 are printed in bold
    typeface.<br />\r\nSubclauses, notes, tables and figures which are additional
    to those in IEC 63241-1 are numbered starting from 101.<br />\r\nNOTE The attention
    of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing
    organizations can need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new
    requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.<br />\r\nIt
    is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be
    adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date
    of publication."
