abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-2-50:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-50:2020
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of INFANT PHOTOTHERAPY EQUIPMENT,
    as defined in 201.3.203, also referred to as ME EQUIPMENT. If a clause or subclause
    is specifically intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT only, or to ME SYSTEMS
    only, the title and content of that clause or subclause will say so. If that is
    not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS,
    as relevant. HAZARDS inherent in the intended physiological function of ME EQUIPMENT
    or ME SYSTEMS within the scope of this document are not covered by specific requirements
    in this document, except in 7.2.13 and 8.4.1 of the general standard. IEC 60601-2-50:2020
    specifies safety requirements for INFANT PHOTOTHERAPY EQUIPMENT, but alternate
    methods of compliance with a specific clause by demonstrating equivalent safety
    will not be judged as non-compliant if the MANUFACTURER has demonstrated in his
    RISK MANAGEMENT FILE that the RISK presented by the HAZARD has been found to be
    of an acceptable level when weighed against the benefit of treatment from the
    device.<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-50:2020 does not apply to:<br />\r\n- devices supplying
    heat via BLANKETS, PADS or MATTRESSES in medical use; for information, see IEC
    60601-2-35;<br />\r\n- INFANT INCUBATORS; for information, see IEC 60601-2-19;<br
    />\r\n- INFANT TRANSPORT INCUBATORS; for information, see IEC 60601-2-20;<br />\r\n-
    INFANT RADIANT WARMERS; for information, see IEC 60601-2-21.<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-50:2020
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009 and Amendment 1:2016.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. IEC 60601-2-50:2020 includes the
    following significant technical change with respect to the previous edition: re-dating
    of normative references."
