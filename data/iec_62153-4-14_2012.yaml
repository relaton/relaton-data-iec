abstract:
- content: IEC 62153-4-14:2012(E) is applicable to the in-field test method that is
    used to determine the coupling attenuation for installed links and channels used
    in analogue and digital communication systems. This method is used to determine
    the attenuation of disturbing power to signal power in a cabling system, and vice
    versa. This determines the influence from cabling on the EMC performance of a
    system. This standard is part of the IEC 62153 series titled Metallic communication
    cable test methods.
