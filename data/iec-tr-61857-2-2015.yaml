  content: IEC TR 61857-2:2015(E) gives guidelines to identify the appropriate test
    method to be used for the evaluation of a proposed Electrical Insulation System
    (EIS). Some of the standards are for evaluation and classification of the EIS,
    while other standards identify the appropriate method to evaluate single or multi-factor
    stresses of a proposed or of an established EIS. This Technical Report is applicable
    to existing or proposed EIS used in electrotechnical products across a wide range
    of operating voltages of IEC Standards. The report takes care to select the appropriate
    standard based on construction and intended operating conditions.
