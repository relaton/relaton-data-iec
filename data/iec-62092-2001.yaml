  content: "Applies to\n\n- hydrophones employing piezoelectric sensor elements, designed
    to measure the pulsed and continuous-wave ultrasonic fields generated by ultrasonic
    equipment;\n\n- hydrophones used for measurements made in water and in the frequency
    range between 15 MHz and 40 MHz;\n \n- hydrophones with or without an integral
    amplifier;\n\n- hydrophones with a circular piezoelectrically active element.\n\n\nSpecifies\n\n-
    relevant hydrophone characteristics;\n\n- methods of determining directional response
    and hydrophone sensitivity based on relative or comparative measurements;\n\n\nand
    describes\n\n- absolute hydrophone calibration methods.\n\n\nRecommendations and
    references to accepted literature are made for the various relative and absolute
    calibration methods in the frequency range covered by this International Standard."
