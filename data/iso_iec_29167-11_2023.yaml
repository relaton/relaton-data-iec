abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29167-11:2023 This document defines the crypto suite for PRESENT-80
    for the ISO/IEC 18000 series of air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices. This document provides a common crypto suite for security for
    RFID devices for air interface standards and application standards. The crypto
    suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies basic security services that are use the lightweight block cipher PRESENT-80.
    The variant of PRESENT that takes 128-bit keys is also considered in this document.<br
    />\r\nThis document defines various methods of use for the cipher.<br />\r\nA
    Tag and an Interrogator can support one, a subset, or all of the specified options,
    clearly stating what is supported."
