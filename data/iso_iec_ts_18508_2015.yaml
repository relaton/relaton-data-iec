abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015 speciﬁes the form and establishes the interpretation
    of facilities that extend the For-tran language deﬁned by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010,
    ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor 1:2012, and ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010/Cor 2:2013. The purpose
    of this Technical Speciﬁcation is to promote portability, reliability, maintainability,
    and ef-ﬁcient execution of parallel programs written in Fortran, for use on a
    variety of computing systems.<p>ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015 does not specify formal
    data consistency model. Developing the formal data consist-ency model is left
    until the integration of these facilities into ISO/IEC 1539-1.</p>
