abstract:
- content: "IEC 62862-5-2:2022 specifies the requirements and the test methods for
    the characterization of a large-size linear Fresnel collector.<br />\r\nThis document
    covers the determination of optical and thermal performance of linear Fresnel
    collectors, and the tracking accuracy of the collector one-axis tracking system.
    This test method is for outdoor testing only.<br />\r\nThis document applies to
    linear Fresnel collectors according to Annex A equipped with the manufacturer-supplied
    sun tracking mechanism.<br />\r\nThis document applies to the whole collector
    field in-situ or as a minimum unit to be tested to an individual collector string
    (loop) connected to the main piping (flow, return flow) to and from a heat sink,
    covering the full temperature range of the field."
