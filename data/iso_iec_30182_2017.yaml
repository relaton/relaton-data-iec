abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 30182:2017 describes, and gives guidance on, a smart city concept
    model (SCCM) that can provide the basis of interoperability between component
    systems of a smart city, by aligning the ontologies in use across different sectors.
    It includes:</p><p>- concepts (e.g. ORGANIZATION, PLACE, COMMUNITY, ITEM, METRIC,
    SERVICE, RESOURCE); and</p><p>- relationships between concepts (e.g. ORGANIZATION
    has RESOURCEs, EVENT at a PLACE).</p><p>The SCCM does not replace existing models
    where they exist, but, by mapping from a local model to a parent model, questions
    can be asked about data in a new and joined-up way.</p><p>ISO/IEC 30182:2017 is
    aimed at organizations that provide services to communities in cities, and manage
    the resulting data, as well as decision-makers and policy developers in cities.1)</p><p>The
    SCCM is relevant wherever many organizations provide services to many communities
    within a place.</p><p>It does not cover the data standards that are relevant to
    each concept in the SCCM and does not attempt to list or recommend the sources
    of identifiers and categorizations that cities map to the SCCM.</p><p>The SCCM
    has been devised to communicate the meaning of data. It does not attempt to provide
    concepts to describe the metadata of a dataset, for example, validity and provenance
    of data.</p><p>It covers semantic interoperability, that is, defining the meaning
    of data, particularly from many sources. It does not cover other barriers to interoperability,
    some of which are described at 3.2.</p>"
