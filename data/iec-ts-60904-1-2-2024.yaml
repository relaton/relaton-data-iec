  content: "IEC TS 60904-1-2:2024 describes procedures for the measurement of the
    current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of single junction bifacial photovoltaic
    devices in natural or simulated sunlight. It is applicable to encapsulated solar
    cells, sub-assemblies of such cells or entire PV modules. For measurements of
    I-V characteristics of non-encapsulated solar cells, IEC TS 63202-3 applies.<br
    />\r\nThe requirements for measurement of I-V characteristics of standard (monofacial)
    PV devices are covered by IEC 60904-1, whereas this document describes the additional
    requirements for the measurement of I-V characteristics of bifacial PV devices.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2019. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The scope has been updated and refers to
    IEC TS 63202-3 for the measurement of non‑encapsulated solar cells.<br />\r\nb)
    The requirements for the non-uniformity of irradiance have been updated and now
    refer to classifications introduced in IEC 60904-9.<br />\r\nc) The requirement
    for non-irradiated background has been revised.<br />\r\nd) Spectral mismatch
    corrections are no longer mandatory, unless required by another standard. Spectral
    mismatch would have to be considered in the measurement uncertainty.<br />\r\ne)
    The requirement regarding the calculation of bifaciality has been modified: Equivalent
    irradiance shall not be calculated based on the minimum bifaciality value between
    ISC and Pmax, but on the bifaciality of ISC."
