abstract:
- content: "IEC 62477-1:2012+AMD1:2016 applies to Power Electronic Converter Systems
    (PECS) and equipment, their components for electronic power conversion and electronic
    power switching, including the means for their control, protection, monitoring
    and measurement, such as with the main purpose of converting electric power, with
    rated system voltages not exceeding 1 000 V a.c. or 1 500 V d.c. This document
    may also be used as a reference standard for product committees producing product
    standards for:<br />\r\n- adjustable speed electric power drive systems (PDS);<br
    />\r\n- standalone uninterruptible power systems (UPS);<br />\r\n- low voltage
    stabilized d.c. power supplies.<br />\r\nFor PECS for which no product standard
    exists, this standard provides minimum requirements for safety aspects. This part
    of IEC 62477 has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC
    Guide 104 for power electronic converter systems and equipment for solar, wind,
    tidal, wave, fuel cell or similar energy sources. According to IEC Guide 104,
    one of the responsibilities of technical committees is, wherever applicable, to
    make use of basic safety publications and/or group safety publications in the
    preparation of their product standards. This International Standard:<br />\r\n-
    establishes a common terminology for safety aspects relating to PECS and equipment;<br
    />\r\n- establishes minimum requirements for the coordination of safety aspects
    of interrelated parts within a PECS;<br />\r\n- establishes a common basis for
    minimum safety requirements for the PEC portion of products that contain PEC;<br
    />\r\n- specifies requirements to reduce risks of fire, electric shock, thermal,
    energy and mechanical hazards, during use and operation and, where specifically
    stated, during service and maintenance;<br />\r\n- specifies minimum requirements
    to reduce risks with respect to pluggable and permanently connected equipment,
    whether it consists of a system of interconnected units or independent units,
    subject to installing, operating and maintaining the equipment in the manner prescribed
    by the manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis International Standard does not cover:<br />\r\n-
    telecommunications apparatus other than power supplies to such apparatus;<br />\r\n-
    functional safety aspects as covered by e.g. IEC 61508;<br />\r\n- electrical
    equipment and systems for railways applications and electric vehicles.<br />\r\nThis
    consolidated version consists of the first edition (2012) and its amendment 1
    (2016). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication."
