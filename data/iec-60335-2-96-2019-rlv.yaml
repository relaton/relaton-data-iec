  content: "IEC 60335-2-96:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-96:2019
    deals with the safety of flexible sheet heating elements intended to be incorporated
    into floors and walls below 1,2 m and above 2,3 m and in ceilings, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase installations and 480 V for
    other installations.<br />\r\nFlexible sheet heating elements are converted into
    heating units that are incorporated in the building in accordance with the instructions
    after which the required level of protection against hazards is achieved. Attention
    is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– in many countries, different wiring rules
    apply;<br />\r\n– for heating units intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries, additional requirements are specified by the national authorities for
    fire protection, the national authorities for building regulations, the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n–
    heating units intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– heating
    units intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such
    as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– blankets, pads, clothing and similar flexible heating appliances (IEC
    60335-2-17);<br />\r\n– foot warmers and heating mats (IEC 60335-2-81);<br />\r\n–
    heated carpets and for heating units for room heating installed under removable
    floor coverings (IEC 60335-2-106);<br />\r\n– flexible sheet heating elements
    incorporated in other appliances.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2003 and Amendment 2: 2008. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the first edition:<br />\r\n– aligns
    the text with IEC 60335-1:2010, and its Amendments 1 and 2;<br />\r\n– some notes
    have been converted to normative text or deleted (5.6, 7.12.1, 10.1, 11.2.103,
    13.1, 13.2, 16.2, 16.3, 18.101, 18.102.5, 21.1, 22.103, 22.105, 22.106);<br />\r\n–
    the strength test for heating units incorporating insulated wires intended to
    be installed in floors has been modified a (21.103);<br />\r\n– the scope and
    specific requirements have been added for heating units installed in walls below
    a height of 1,2 m (6.2, 7.1, 7.12.1, 7.12.6, 7.101, 11.2, 19.2, 22.106, 24.102,
    Annex AA).<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-10) has been included
    in this copy."
