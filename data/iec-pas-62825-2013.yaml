  content: IEC/PAS 62825:2013(E), which is a Publicly Available Specification, applies
    to plasma display panel TVs which are intended for use in residential or commercial
    environments, which have a visible display area with a diagonal dimension of 1
    m or greater, and which are within the scope of CISPR 13 or CISPR 32. This specification
    covers emission requirements related to radiated radio-frequency (RF) disturbances
    in the frequency range 150 kHz to 30 MHz. It specifies suitable limits and methods
    of measurement for the assessment of radiated RF disturbances. The requirements
    specified in this specification are essential EMC requirements which should be
    met in order to protect radio reception in the frequency range up to 30 MHz at
    locations where these display devices are operated in the field. While application
    of this specification is recommended, the comprehensive set of normative EMC emission
    requirements is found in CISPR 13 or CISPR 32. Use of this specification does
    not remove the obligation to apply any other CISPR publication. The objectives
    of this specification are to establish supplementary requirements which provide
    an adequate level of protection of the radio frequency spectrum, allowing radio
    reception as intended in the frequency range 150 kHz to 30 MHz, and to specify
    procedures to ensure the reproducibility of measurement and the repeatability
    of obtained results.
