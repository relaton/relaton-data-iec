abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 25185-1:2016 provides an authentication protocol suitable for use
    in physical and logical access control systems based on ICCs and related systems
    which support standards based AES-128 and RSA-2048 ciphers and the SHA-256 hashing
    algorithm.<p>It specifies PLAID and its implementation in sufficient detail to
    allow any two or more implementations to be interoperable.</p><p>It does not address
    how implementations share cryptographic keys, access control system credential
    records (including revocation) or manage payload entities such as PIN, PINHash,
    or biometric templates or other payload objects.</p>
