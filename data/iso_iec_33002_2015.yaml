    facilitate self-assessment,</p><p>b) provide a basis for improving process performance
    and mitigating process-related risk,</p><p>c) produce a rating of the achievement
    of the relevant process quality characteristic, and</p><p>d) provide an objective
    benchmark between organizations.</p><p>ISO/IEC 33002:2015 is applicable across
