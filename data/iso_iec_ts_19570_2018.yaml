abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes requirements for implementations of an interface
    that computer programs written in the C++ programming language can use to invoke
    algorithms with parallel execution. The algorithms described by this document
    are realizable across a broad class of computer architectures.</p><p>There is
    a possibility of a subset of the functionality described by this document being
    standardized in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part of any C++
    standard. There is a possibility of some of the functionality in this document
    never being standardized, or of it being standardized in a substantially changed
    form.</p><p>The goal of this document is to build widespread existing practice
    for parallelism in the C++ programming language. It gives advice on extensions
    to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>"
