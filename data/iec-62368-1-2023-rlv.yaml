  content: "IEC 62368-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62368-1:2023
    is a product safety standard that classifies energy sources, prescribes safeguards
    against those energy sources, and provides guidance on the application of, and
    requirements for, those safeguards. The prescribed safeguards are intended to
    reduce the likelihood of pain, injury and, in the case of fire, property damage.
    The objective of the introduction is to help designers to understand the underlying
    principles of safety in order to design safe equipment. These principles are informative
    and not an alternative to the detailed requirements of this document."
