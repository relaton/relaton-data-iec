    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document defines biometric services used for identity assurance that are invoked over a services-based framework. It provides a generic set of biometric and identity-related functions and associated data definitions to allow remote access to biometric services.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The binding of these services to specific frameworks is not included in this document but is the subject of other parts of the ISO/IEC 30108 series.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Although focused on biometrics, this document includes support for other related identity assurance mechanisms such as biographic and document capabilities. IAVS is intended to be compatible with and used in conjunction with other biometric standards as des</span><span lang="EN-GB">cribed in </span><span lang="EN-GB">Clause 6.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Specification of biometric functionality is limited to remote (backend) services. Services between a client-side application and biometric capture devices are not within the scope of this document.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Integration of biometric services as part of an authentication service or protocol is not within the scope of this document.</span></p>
