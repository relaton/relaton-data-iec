abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-12:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60317-12:2020
    specifies the requirements of enamelled round copper winding wires of class 120
    with a sole coating based on polyvinyl acetal or polyvinyl formal resin, which
    can be modified provided it retains the chemical identity of the original resin
    and meets all specified wire requirements.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 A modified resin is
    a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives
    to enhance certain performance or application characteristics.<br />\r\nNOTE 2
    Polyvinyl acetal is a general name for a family of thermoplastic vinyl resins
    produced by the condensation of polyvinyl alcohol with an aldehyde. Examples are
    polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl formal and polyvinyl butyral. The range of nominal
    conductor diameters covered by this document is:<br />\r\n- Grade 1: 0,040 mm
    up to and including 2,500 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2: 0,040 mm up to and including
    5,000 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 3: 0,080 mm up to and including 5,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe
    nominal conductor diameters are specified in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This
    fourth edition of IEC 60317-12 cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- modification of the Scope;<br />\r\n- addition of reference to transformer
    oil resistance test method in Clause 20."
