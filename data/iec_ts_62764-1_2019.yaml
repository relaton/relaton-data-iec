abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62764-1:2019(E) applies to the assessment of human exposure to
    low frequency magnetic fields generated by automotive vehicles. For plug-in vehicles,
    this includes the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) and associated cables
    provided by the car manufacturer.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document establishes
    the measurement procedure for the evaluation of magnetic field levels in the automotive
    environment, for passenger cars and commercial vehicles of categories M1 and N1
    as defined in ECE/TRANS/WP.29/78/Rev.3 [1], with respect to human exposure. It
    provides standardized operating conditions and defines recommended measurements
    to assess compliance to the applicable exposure requirements.<br />\r\nThis document
    covers the frequency range 1 Hz to 400 kHz and is applicable to any type of engine
    and/or internal energy source.<br />\r\nIt is not the scope of this document to
    define procedures for wireless power transfer (WPT). Human exposure due to WPT
    is covered by IEC 61980-1 [2].<br />\r\nAbnormal operation of the vehicle or equipment
    under test is not taken into consideration.<br />\r\nKey Words:Human Exposure,
    Low Frequency Magnetic Fields, Electric vehicle Supply Equipment"
