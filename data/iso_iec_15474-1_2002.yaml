abstract:
- content: "<p>The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a
    description of a mechanism for transferring</p><p>information between modelling
    tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing
    and</p><p>exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform
    to CDIF.</p><p>The CDIF family of standards includes a semantic metamodel and
    a transfer format definition. It also includes the</p><p>specification of a meta-metamodel
    and associated rules that define a framework for the semantic metamodel and</p><p>the
    transfer format. The language that is defined for the transfer format also has
    applicability as a general language</p><p>for Import/Export for repositories.
    The CDIF semantic metamodel also has applicability as the basis of standard</p><p>definitions
    for use in repositories.</p><p>The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the various standards
    that comprise the CDIF family of standards. The shaded box</p><p>depicts this
    Standard and its position in the CDIF family of standards.</p><p/><p>This document
    introduces the CDIF family of standards and defines the terms common to the CDIF
    family of</p><p>standards.</p><p>This document is intended to be used by anyone
    wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document provides</p><p>an introduction
    to the entire CDIF family of standards. It is suitable for:</p><p> Those evaluating
    CDIF,</p><p> Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF
    transfer, and</p><p> Those developing importers and exporters.</p><p>This document,
    ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002<em>, Information technology - CDIF framework - Part 1: Overview,</em>and
    the</p><p>Framework document ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002<em>, Information technology
    - CDIF framework - Part 2: Modelling and</em></p><p><em>extensibility</em>, should
    be read first when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read other
    documents in the</p><p>CDIF family of standards.</p><p>While there are no specific
    prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful for the reader to
    have familiarity</p><p>with the following:</p><p> Entity-Relationship-Attribute
    modelling;</p><p> Modelling (CASE) tools;</p><p> Information repositories;</p><p>
    Data dictionaries;</p><p> Multiple meta-layer modelling.</p>"
