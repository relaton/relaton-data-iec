abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 30163:2021 specifies the system requirements of an Internet
    of Things (IoT)&#x2F;Sensor Network (SN) technology-based platform for chattel
    asset monitoring supporting financial services, including:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n-
    System infrastructure that describes functional components;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n-
    System and functional requirements during the entire chattel asset management
    process, including chattel assets in transition, in&#x2F;out of warehouse, storage,
    mortgage, etc.;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- Performance requirements and performance
    specifications of each functional component;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- Interface definition
    of the integrated platform system.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nThis document is applicable
    to the design and development of IoT&#x2F;SN system for chattel asset monitoring
    supporting financial services."
