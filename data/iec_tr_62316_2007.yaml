abstract:
- content: This Technical Report provides guidelines for the interpretation of backscattering
    traces, as obtained by an optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR). In this edition,
    polarization effects are discussed in a case of unidirectional trace; and a new
    clause dealing with uncertainties, deviation and resolution has been introduced.
