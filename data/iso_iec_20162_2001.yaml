abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a 300
    mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) of Type WORM (Write</p><p>Once Read Many) using
    irreversible effects, with a capacity of 30 Gbytes. This WORM ODC's uses writing
    effects that are</p><p>inherently irreversible. Written marks cannot be erased
    and attempted modifications of the written marks are detectable.</p><p>This International
    Standard specifies</p><p>− the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference
    Drive;</p><p>− the environments in which the cartridges are to be operated and
    stored;</p><p>− the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the
    cartridge, so as to provide mechanical interchange ability</p><p>between data
    processing systems;</p><p>− the format of the information on the disk, both pre-written
    and user-written, including the physical disposition of the tracks</p><p>and sectors,
    the error correction codes, the modulation methods used;</p><p>− the characteristics
    of the prerecorded information on the disk;</p><p>− the recording characteristics
    of the disk, enabling processing systems to write data onto the disk;</p><p>−
    the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing
    systems to read data from the disk.</p><p>This International Standard provides
    for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume
    and file</p><p>structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing
    systems.</p>"
