  content: "IEC 62271-107:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62271-107:2019
    applies to three-pole-operated fused circuit-switchers designed with rated voltages
    above 1 kV up to and including 52 kV for use on three-phase alternating current
    systems of either 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) technical changes introduced by the second
    edition of IEC 62271-1 are applied, where relevant;<br />\r\nb) rated TRV is removed
    and TRV is now treated as a test parameter), as in IEC 62271-100;<br />\r\nc)
    the term \"thermal current\" is no longer used; the rated continuous current is
    linked to the installed fuse-links, and values shall be provided by the manufacturer
    together with the list of the acceptable fuse-links; for tests purpose, the highest
    rated continuous current listed is referred, where previously the wording was
    \"rated maximum thermal current\", for consistency with IEC 62271-105;<br />\r\nd)
    making and breaking test duties are independent type tests (as some may be omitted
    if the switching device has been validated as a load-break switch). However, TDIt0
    and TDIlow are kept as a sequence as they are linked to the same rated value (It0);<br
    />\r\ne) differentiation has been introduced between requirements expressed for
    fulfilling the function expected from a fused circuit-switcher, from requirements
    only relevant when the function is performed by a stand-alone device. The goal
    is to avoid duplication or conflicts of requirements with a standard dealing with
    assemblies, when the function is implemented within such an assembly."
