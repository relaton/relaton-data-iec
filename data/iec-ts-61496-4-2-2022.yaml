  content: "IEC TS 61496-4-2:2022 specifies requirements for the design, construction
    and testing of non-contact electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed
    specifically to detect persons as part of a safety-related system, employing vision-based
    protective devices (VBPDs) using reference pattern techniques (VBPDPP) for the
    sensing function. Special attention is directed to features which ensure that
    an appropriate safety-related performance is achieved. An ESPE can include optional
    safety-related functions, the requirements for which are given in Annex A of IEC
    61496-1:2020 and this document. Where this document does not contain all necessary
    provisions, then IEC TS 62998-1 applies. It is also possible, for those aspects
    not considered in this document, to use provisions from IEC TS 62998-1 additionally.
    This document does not specify the dimensions or configurations of the detection
    zone and its disposition in relation to hazardous parts for any particular application,
    nor what constitutes a hazardous state of any machine. It is restricted to the
    functioning of the ESPE and how it interfaces with the machine. A VBPDPP is defined
    as consisting of a single image-sensing device viewing on a passive reference
    pattern as the background and where the detection principle is based on blocking
    or partially preventing the view of the pattern. Information about the thickness,
    shape, surface characteristics or location of the object is not required for detection.
    For multi-image sensing devices, additional techniques, requirements and test
    procedures can be necessary.<br />\r\n- This document is limited to automatic
    vision-based ESPEs that do not require human intervention for detection.<br />\r\n-
    It is limited to automatic vision-based ESPEs that detect objects entering into,
    or are present in, a detection zone(s).<br />\r\n- It is limited to ESPEs using
    active illumination technique.<br />\r\n- Excluded from this technical specification
    are VBPDPPs employing radiation at wavelengths outside the range 400 nm to 1 500
    nm.<br />\r\n- This document does not address those aspects required for complex
    classification or differentiation of the object detected.<br />\r\nThis document
    is relevant for VBPDPPs having a stated detection capability up to 200 mm. This
    document does not deal with EMC emission requirements.<br />\r\nIEC TS 61496-4-2:2022
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Some requirement clauses and test
    procedures have been adapted or removed because they have been consolidated in
    IEC 61496-1:2020 (e.g. 5.4.6.2 of IEC 61496-1:2020 Light sources or Clause A.9)."
