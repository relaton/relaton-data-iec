  content: "IEC 60444-6:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60444-6:2021
    applies to the measurements of drive level dependence (DLD) of quartz crystal
    units. Two test methods (A and C) and one referential method (B) are described.
    “Method A”, based on the p-network according to IEC 60444-5, can be used in the
    complete frequency range covered by this part of IEC 60444. “Reference Method
    B”, based on the p-network or reflection method according to IEC 60444-5 or IEC
    60444-8 can be used in the complete frequency range covered by this part of IEC
    60444. “Method C”, an oscillator method, is suitable for measurements of fundamental
    mode crystal units in larger quantities with fixed conditions.<br />\r\nNOTE The
    measurement methods specified in this document are not only applicable to AT-cut,
    but also to other crystal cuts and vibration modes, such as doubly rotated cuts
    (IT,SC) and to tuning fork crystal units (by using a high impedance test fixture).
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- some equations have been removed and corrected;<br
    />\r\n- it has been specified in the note of the Scope that the measurement methods
    specified in this document are not only applicable to AT-cut but also to other
    crystal cuts and vibration modes."
