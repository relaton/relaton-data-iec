abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13249 defines a number of packages of generic data types common
    to various kinds of data used in multimedia and application areas, to enable that
    data to be stored and manipulated in an SQL database. The package in each subject
    area is defined as a part of ISO/IEC 13249. ISO/IEC 13249-1:2007 defines those
    concepts, notations and conventions that are common to two or more other parts
    of ISO/IEC 13249. In particular, it describes the way ISO/IEC 9075 is used in
    other parts of ISO/IEC 13249 to define the user-defined types and their behaviour
    appropriate to each subject area.</p>"
