abstract:
- content: "IEC 62448:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62448:2017
    specifies a generic format for multimedia e-publishing employed for e-book data
    interchange among data preparers and publishers, satisfying a number of publishersâ€™
    requirements: revisable, extensible and heterogeneous logical structure. This
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition, published in 2013 and constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) clarifying descriptions;<br
    />\r\nb) deleting redundant statements;<br />\r\nc) resolving mistakes and confusing
    terminologies."
