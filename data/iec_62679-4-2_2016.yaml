abstract:
- content: IEC 62679-4-2:2016(E) specifies the environmental conditions to determine
    the environmental reliability of electronic paper display (EPD) panels and/or
    modules for storage under the assumed usage environment. The scope of this document
    is restricted to EPDs using either segment, passive, or active matrix with either
    monochromatic or colour type displays. The measuring methods are intended for
    EPDs operated in a reflective mode.
