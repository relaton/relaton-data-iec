- content: "For aspects of quality specific to the finger image modality, ISO/IEC
    TR 29794-4:2010:<br /><br />\r\n\t\r\n\t\tspecifies terms and definitions that
    are useful in the specification, use, and test of finger image quality metrics;<br
    />\r\n\t\r\n\t\tdefines the interpretation of finger image quality scores;<br
    />\r\n\t\r\n\t\tidentifies or defines finger image corpora for the purpose of
    serving as information for algorithm developers and users;<br />\r\n\t\r\n\t\tdevelops
    statistical methodologies specific to finger image corpora for characterizing
    quality metrics to facilitate interpretation of scores and their relation to matching
    performance.<br /><br /><br />\r\nPerformance assessment of quality algorithms
    and standardization of quality algorithms are outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR
    29794-4:2010."
