abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a Petri net modeling language or technique, called
    high-level Petri nets, including its syntax and semantics. It provides a reference
    definition that can be used both within and between organizations, to ensure a
    common understanding of the technique and of the specifications written using
    the technique. This document also facilitates the development and interoperability
    of Petri net computer support tools.</p><p>This document is applicable to a wide
    variety of concurrent discrete event systems and in particular distributed systems.
    Generic fields of application include:</p><p>— requirements analysis;</p><p>—
    development of specifications, designs and test suites;</p><p>— descriptions of
    existing systems prior to re-engineering;</p><p>— modeling business and software
    processes;</p><p>— providing the semantics for concurrent languages;</p><p>— simulation
    of systems to increase confidence;</p><p>— formal analysis of the behavior of
    systems;</p><p>— and development of Petri net support tools.</p><p>This document
    can be applied to the design of a broad range of systems and processes, including
    aerospace, air traffic control, avionics, banking, biological and chemical processes,
    business processes, communication protocols, computer hardware architectures,
    control systems, databases, defense command and control systems, distributed computing,
    electronic commerce, fault-tolerant systems, games, hospital procedures, information
    systems, Internet protocols and applications, legal processes, logistics, manufacturing
    systems, metabolic processes, music, nuclear power systems, operating systems,
    transport systems (including railway control), security systems, telecommunications
    and workflows.</p>"
