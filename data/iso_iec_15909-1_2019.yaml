abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15909-1:2019 This document defines a Petri net modeling language
    or technique, called high-level Petri nets, including its syntax and semantics.
    It provides a reference definition that can be used both within and between organizations,
    to ensure a common understanding of the technique and of the specifications written
    using the technique. This document also facilitates the development and interoperability
    of Petri net computer support tools.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to a
    wide variety of concurrent discrete event systems and in particular distributed
    systems. Generic fields of application include:<br />\r\n- requirements analysis;<br
    />\r\n- development of specifications, designs and test suites;<br />\r\n- descriptions
    of existing systems prior to re-engineering;<br />\r\n- modeling business and
    software processes;<br />\r\n- providing the semantics for concurrent languages;<br
    />\r\n- simulation of systems to increase confidence;<br />\r\n- formal analysis
    of the behavior of systems;<br />\r\n- and development of Petri net support tools.<br
    />\r\nThis document can be applied to the design of a broad range of systems and
    processes, including aerospace, air traffic control, avionics, banking, biological
    and chemical processes, business processes, communication protocols, computer
    hardware architectures, control systems, databases, defense command and control
    systems, distributed computing, electronic commerce, fault-tolerant systems, games,
    hospital procedures, information systems, Internet protocols and applications,
    legal processes, logistics, manufacturing systems, metabolic processes, music,
    nuclear power systems, operating systems, transport systems (including railway
    control), security systems, telecommunications and workflows."
