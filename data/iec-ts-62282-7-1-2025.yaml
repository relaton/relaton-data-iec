  content: "IEC TS 62282-7-1:2025 covers cell assemblies, test station setup, measuring
    instruments and measuring methods, performance test methods, and test reports
    for PEFC single cells.<br />\r\nThis document is used for evaluating:<br />\r\na)
    the performance and durability of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for PEFCs
    in a single cell configuration;<br />\r\nb) materials or structures of PEFCs in
    a single cell configuration; or,<br />\r\nc) the influence of impurities in fuel
    and/or in air on the fuel cell performance and durability.<br />\r\nThis document
    is for proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) basically having flow field
    configurations and using hydrogen or hydrogen containing gas as fuel. It excludes
    from the scope fuel cells based on anion exchange membranes, bipolar membranes,
    and phosphoric acid doped polybenzimidazole membranes."
