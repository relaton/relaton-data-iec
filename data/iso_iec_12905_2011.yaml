abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 12905:2011 specifies a set of data elements to be personalized
    into an integrated circuit card, encoding cardholder preferences. These data elements
    are to be retrieved from the card and to be used to indicate to the terminal that
    the user has special needs regarding the user interface. It is not intended to
    standardize the actual application programming interface or other terminal-specific
    software allowing the functionality, nor does it cover the actual alignment of
    the card to the card-reader slot. ISO/IEC 12905:2011 is independent of the physical
    interface and is applicable to situations where the cardholder operates the card-accepting
    equipment (e.g. a cash dispenser, ticket machine, vending machine). It applies
    not only to ID-1 type cards, but also to SIM/UIM (ID-000) on mobile phones and
    form-factor-free contactless integrated circuit cards which are specified in ISO/IEC
    14443.ISO/IEC 12905:2011 comprises: data elements containing the user preferences,the
    storage/retrieval formats for input and output of these data elements, security
    related to the information contained in these data elements,the access method
    to these data elements, andprotection of cardholder information.'
