abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 12905:2011 specifies a set of data elements to be personalized
    into an integrated circuit card, encoding cardholder preferences. These data elements
    are to be retrieved from the card and to be used to indicate to the terminal that
    the user has special needs regarding the user interface. It is not intended to
    standardize the actual application programming interface or other terminal-specific
    software allowing the functionality, nor does it cover the actual alignment of
    the card to the card-reader slot.</p><p>ISO/IEC 12905:2011 is independent of the
    physical interface and is applicable to situations where the cardholder operates
    the card-accepting equipment (e.g. a cash dispenser, ticket machine, vending machine).
    It applies not only to ID-1 type cards, but also to SIM/UIM (ID-000) on mobile
    phones and form-factor-free contactless integrated circuit cards which are specified
    in ISO/IEC 14443.</p><p>ISO/IEC 12905:2011 comprises:</p><ul><li>data elements
    containing the user preferences,</li><li>the storage/retrieval formats for input
    and output of these data elements,</li><li>security related to the information
    contained in these data elements,</li><li>the access method to these data elements,
    and</li><li>protection of cardholder information.</li></ul>"
