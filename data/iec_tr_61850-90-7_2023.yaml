abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 61850-90-7:2023 is available as IEC TR 61850-90-7:2023
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC TR 61850-90-7:2023,
    which is a Technical Report, describes functions for power converter-based distributed
    energy resources (DER) systems, focused on DC-to-AC and AC-to-AC conversions and
    including photovoltaic systems (PV), battery storage systems, electric vehicle
    (EV) charging systems, and any other DER systems with a controllable power converter.
    The functions defined in this document were used to help define the information
    models described in IEC 61850-7-420 and which can be used in the exchange of information
    between these power converter-based DER systems and the utilities, energy service
    providers (ESPs), or other entities which are tasked with managing the volt, var,
    and watt capabilities of these power converter-based systems. These power converter-based
    DER systems can range from very small grid-connected systems at residential customer
    sites, to medium-sized systems configured as microgrids on campuses or communities,
    to very large systems in utility-operated power plants, and to many other configurations
    and ownership models. They may or may not combine different types of DER systems
    behind the power converter, such as a power converter-based DER system and a battery
    that are connected at the DC level. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2013. This edition is primarily an editorial revision
    in order to be consistent with the publication of Edition 2 of IEC 61850-7-420:2021.
    This edition includes the following significant changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 3 has been updated.<br />\r\nb) Clause 8 (IEC 61850
    information models for power converter-based functions) has been deleted. This
    clause defined data models with the transitional namespace “(Tr) IEC 61850-90-7:2012”.
    The data models are now defined in IEC 61850-7-420."
