    <p>ISO/IEC 21000-20:2016 specifies a language for representing contracts in the Multimedia Framework formed for the transaction of MPEG-21 Digital Items or services related to the MPEG-21 Framework.</p>
    <p>Contract Expression Language (CEL) aims at digitally representing the agreements made in environments using ISO/IEC 21000. These agreements are contracts for transactions of content packed as Digital Items, as well as services provided around this content.</p>
    <p>The range of contracts under scope are as follows:</p>
    <p>-      contracts about transactions on rights for the exploitation of content as MPEG-21 Digital Items;</p>
    <p>-      contracts about the provision of MPEG-21-based services, i.e. delivery, identification, encryption, search and others.</p>
    <p>The aspects represented by CEL contracts include the following:</p>
    <p>-      the textual clauses, in natural language as they are in the narrative contract, duly structured;</p>
    <p>-      the operative clauses, as computer language expressions.</p>
