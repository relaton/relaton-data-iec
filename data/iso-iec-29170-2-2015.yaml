    <p>ISO/IEC 29170-2:2015 normalizes evaluation and grading of a light coding system used for displays and display systems, but is independent of the display technology. This procedure measures whether an observer can distinguish between an uncompressed reference and the reconstructed image to a pre-determined, statistically meaningful level.</p>
    <p>The procedure compares individual images with two possible forced choice comparison test methods. This procedure relies on subjective evaluation methods designed to discern image imperfections on electronic colour displays of any technology or size.</p>
