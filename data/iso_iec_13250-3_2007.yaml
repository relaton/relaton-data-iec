abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 13250-3:2007 defines an extensible markup language (XML) vocabulary
    for interchanging topic maps. The interpretation of the syntax is defined through
    a mapping from the syntax to the Topic Maps data model defined in ISO/IEC 13250-2.The
    vocabulary, known as XML Topic Maps (XTM) 2.0, is not designed to be extended
    or modified. Ease of human authoring was not a primary design goal, and consequently
    it is not recommended to edit the syntax directly.XTM 2.0 is a revision of the
    XTM 1.0 vocabulary defined in ISO/IEC 13250:2003, which was adopted verbatim from
    the XML Topic Maps (XTM) 1.0 specification published by TopicMaps.Org in March
    2001. The differences between the two versions are described.
