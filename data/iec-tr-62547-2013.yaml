  content: "IEC/TR 62547:2013(E) describes two methods for the measurement of the
    sensitivity of single-mode optical fibres to high-power damage at bends:<br />\r\n-
    test method 1 - Failure time characterisation as a function of the launch power
    and bend conditions (bend angle and bend diameter);<br />\r\n- test method 2 -
    Equilibrium temperature measurement. Results from the two methods can only be
    compared qualitatively. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2009, and constitutes a technical revision. The main changes with
    respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n- updates related to B6 (bend-insensitive)
    category single-mode fibres);<br />\r\n- update to analysis for test method 2:
    Maximum temperature specification. Key words: sensitivity of single-mode optical
    fibres to high-power damage at bends"
