  content: 'IEC 62680-1-2:2016(E) defines a power delivery system covering all elements
    of a USB system including: Hosts, Devices, Hubs, Chargers and cable assemblies.
    This specification describes the architecture, protocols, power supply behaviour,
    connectors and cabling necessary for managing power delivery over USB at up to
    100W. This specification is intended to be fully compatible and extend the existing
    USB infrastructure. It is intended that this specification will allow system OEMs,
    power supply and peripheral developers adequate flexibility for product versatility
    and market differentiation without losing backwards compatibility. USB Power Delivery
    is designed to operate independently of the existing USB bus defined mechanisms
    used to negotiate power.'
