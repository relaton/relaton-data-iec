  content: "IEC 63144-1:2020(E) applies, in the field of metrology, to the statement
    and testing of technical data in datasheets and instruction manuals for thermographic
    cameras that are used to measure the temperature of surfaces. This includes, unless
    otherwise stated, both two-dimensional and one-dimensional (line cameras or line
    scanners) temperature measuring instruments, independently of the scanning principle
    (fixed multi-element detector or scanning camera system).<br />\r\nThis document
    describes standard test methods to determine relevant metrological data of thermographic
    cameras. Manufacturers and sellers can choose relevant data and can state that
    the data shall be compliant with this Technical Specification."
