abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 15444-10:2011 defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy
    compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, grey-scale, colour digital
    volumetric images, or multi-component volumetric images. This set of methods extends
    the elements in the core coding system described in Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC
    15444-1 and Rec. ITU-T T.801 | ISO/IEC 15444-2. Extensions which pertain to encoding
    and decoding are defined as procedures which may be used in combination with the
    encoding and decoding processes described in Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1
    and Rec. ITU-T T.801 | ISO/IEC 15444-2. Each encoding or decoding extension shall
    be used only in combination with particular coding processes and only in accordance
    with the requirements set forth herein. ISO/IEC 15444-10:2011 also defines extensions
    to the compressed data format, i.e. interchange format and the abbreviated formats.
    In particular, for Rec. ITU-T T.801 | ISO/IEC 15444-2, the following extensions
    are supported by ISO/IEC 15444-10:2011: - variable DC offset; - arbitrary wavelet
    transform kernels; - multi-component transformations; - non-linear transformations;
    - region-of-interest.'
