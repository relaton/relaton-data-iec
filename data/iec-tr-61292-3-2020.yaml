    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li>document
    architecture now focuses on EDFA, FRA and SOA;</li>\r\n\t<li>the description of
    PDFA and TDFA has been moved to the annexes;</li>\r\n\t<li>the EDWA description
    has been deleted;</li>\r\n\t<li>information on single channel amplification, multi-channel
    amplification, configuration and control method for EDFA, FRA and SOA has been
    added;</li>\r\n\t<li>information on future amplifiers, arrayed amplifiers and
