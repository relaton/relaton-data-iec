    IEC 62074-1:2009(E) applies to fibre optic wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) devices. These have all of the following general features:<br />
    - they are passive, in that they contain no optoelectronic or other transducing elements; but<br />
    - they may use temperature control only the purpose to stabilize the characteristics of devices;<br />
    - they exclude any optical switching function;<br />
    - they have three or more ports for the entry and/or exit of optical power, and share optical power among these ports in a predetermined fashion depending on the wavelength;<br />
    - the are optical fibres or optical fibre connectors.
