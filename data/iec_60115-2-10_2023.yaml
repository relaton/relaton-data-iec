abstract:
- content: "IEC 60115-2-10:2023(E) is a detail specification which specifies the characteristics
    and ratings of low-power film resistors with leads for use in electronic equipment,
    which are typically assembled in through-hole technology (THT) on circuit boards.
    This detail specification establishes test schedules and performance requirements
    permitting the quality assessment of the resistors covered herein according to
    the quality assessment procedures specified by IEC 60115-1:2020, Annex Q.<br />\r\nThis
    first edition cancels and replaces IEC 60115-2-1:1982. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tit employs the
    product classification based on application requirements as defined in the generic
    specification IEC 60115‑1:2020;\r\n\tit permits the specification of additional
    dimensional requirements concerning the eccentricity of termination wires and
    the coating extending onto wires;\r\n\tit provides for a tabulated presentation
    of resistance ranges in relationship to the temperature coefficient and the tolerance;\r\n\tit
    supports solderability testing for both traditional lead-bearing soldering and
    up-to-date lead-free soldering, as required;\r\n\tit introduces a test for the
    specimens’ robustness to electrostatic discharge;\r\n\tit introduces a test for
    the specimens’ resistance to solvents;\r\n\tit introduces a test for the flammability
    of the specimens;\r\n\tit employs consistent stability requirements grouped in
    stability classes;\r\n\tit supports the provision of detailed visual acceptance
    criteria;\r\n\tit includes the requirement for a visual examination of the primary
    and proximity packaging;\r\n\tit provides the correlated test schedules for a
    qualification approval and for subsequent quality conformance inspections side
    by side;\r\n\tit employs quality assessment procedures which meet the requirements
    of a zero-defect approach, which evades the use of historic AQL levels and the
    permission of non-conforming specimens in test groups;\r\n\tit provides for the
    inclusion of specific visual acceptance criteria, to be applied in addition to
    those given in Annex B of the sectional specification IEC 60115-2:2023;\r\n\tit
    provides for the optional coverage of 0 Ω resistors (jumpers) within the scope
    of the drafted detail specification;\r\n\tfurthermore, it employs a new document
    structure, for which a transition guidance is provided in Annex X."
