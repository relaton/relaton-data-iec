  content: "IEC TS 61851-3-1:2023 This part of IEC 61851, which is a Technical Specification,
    applies to the equipment, including stationary equipment for<br />\r\n- the conductive
    transfer of electric power between the supply network and<br />\r\n- an electric
    road vehicle, or<br />\r\n- a removable rechargeable energy storage system (RESS),
    or<br />\r\n- an on-board RESS of an electric road vehicle,<br />\r\n- when the
    equipment is connected to the supply network having a supply voltage up to 480
    V AC or up to 400 V DC and a rated output voltage up to 120 V DC, and<br />\r\n-
    where the protection against electric shock relies on double or reinforced insulation,
    and with double or reinforced insulation between all AC and DC inputs and outputs."
