abstract:
- content: "IEC Guide 104:2019(E) is mandatory and defines procedures for the preparation
    of safety publications in addition to ISO/IEC Guide 51, including the preparation
    and use of basic safety publications and group safety publications. Also describes
    the relationship between TCs with horizontal safety functions or group safety
    functions and product TCs. In the context of this guide, \"safety\" relates to
    the safety of persons, domestic animals, livestock and property.\r\nThe main changes
    with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- alignment with
    terms and definitions of ISO/IEC Guide 51:2014;<br />\r\n- reference to IEC Guide
    108 in the introduction;<br />\r\n- creation of BASIC SAFETY PUBLICATION and GROUP
    SAFETY PUBLICATION subcategories to clarify the different types of document (requirements,
    guidance, mandatory test procedures and reference data);<br />\r\n- improved structure:
    new titles and subclauses;<br />\r\n- addition to the responsibilities of the
    technical committees (TCs) with HORIZONTAL SAFETY FUNCTION: development of their
    publications in collaboration with customer TCs and monitoring the use of their
    SAFETY publications;<br />\r\n- replacement of Annex A and the associated text
    by reference to IEC Guide 116;<br />\r\n- shortened status statement for publications
    with BASIC SAFETY PUBLICATION designation;<br />\r\n- addition of the scope items
    of a PRODUCT SAFETY STANDARD."
