    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21411:2001 This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between
    \"QSIG\" and \"H.323\" in support of call diversion supplementary services within
    a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).<br />\r\n\"QSIG\" is a signalling
    protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services
    eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides circuit-switched basic services
    and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards,
    in particular ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services), ISO/IEC
    11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services)
    and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services. ISO/IEC
    13873 specifies the QSIG protocol in support of call diversion services.<br />\r\n\"H.323\"
    is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication
    within a packet network, in particular a packet network that uses the Internet
    Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling protocols
    operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more
    gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint can be a terminal or a gateway to another
    network. H.323 is an \"umbrella\" recommendation referring to various ITU-T recommendations,
    in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities)
    and Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary
    services). Recommendation H.450.3 specifies the H.323 protocol in support of call
    diversion services.<br />\r\nNOTE - H.450.3 applies only to the 1998 version of
    H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.<br />\r\nIn both
    ISO/IEC 13873 (QSIG) and ITU-Recommendation H.450.3 (H.323), the call diversion
    supplementary services are Call Forwarding Unconditional (SS-CFU), Call Forwarding
    Busy (SS-CFB), Call Forwarding No Reply (SS-CFNR) and Call Deflection (SS-CD).
    These supplementary services apply during call establishment and provide diversion
    of an incoming call to another destination.<br />\r\nInterworking between QSIG
    and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user
    of an IP network, or a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate
    at a user of a PISN. This International Standard provides the following<br />\r\nadditional
    capabilities:<br />\r\n- a call originating from a PISN and destined for a user
    of an H.323 network to be diverted by the H.323 network to an alternative destination;<br
    />\r\n- a call originating from an H.323 network and destined for a user of a
    PISN to be diverted by the PISN to an alternative destination;<br />\r\n- a call
    destined for a user of a PISN to be diverted to an alternative destination where
    that alternative destination is in an H.323 network;<br />\r\n- a call destined
    for a user of an H.323 network to be diverted to an alternative destination where
    that alternative destination is in a PISN.<br />\r\nThis International Standard
    is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN
    employing QSIG and an IP network employing H.323."
