abstract:
- content: <p>This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between
    "QSIG" and "H.323" in support of call diversion</p><p>supplementary services within
    a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).</p><p>"QSIG" is a signalling protocol
    that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services eXchanges
    (PINX)</p><p>within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides</p><p>circuit-switched basic
    services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards,
    in particular</p><p>ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services),
    ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of</p><p>supplementary
    services) and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services.
    ISO/IEC 13873 specifies the</p><p>QSIG protocol in support of call diversion services.</p><p>"H.323"
    is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication
    within a packet network, in</p><p>particular a packet network that uses the Internet
    Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling</p><p>protocols
    operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more
    gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint</p><p>can be a terminal or a gateway to
    another network. H.323 is an "umbrella" recommendation referring to various ITU-T</p><p>recommendations,
    in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities)
    and</p><p>Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support
    of supplementary services). Recommendation H.450.3</p><p>specifies the H.323 protocol
    in support of call diversion services.</p><p>NOTE - H.450.3 applies only to the
    1998 version of H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.</p><p>In
    both ISO/IEC 13873 (QSIG) and ITU-Recommendation H.450.3 (H.323), the call diversion
    supplementary services are Call</p><p>Forwarding Unconditional (SS-CFU), Call
    Forwarding Busy (SS-CFB), Call Forwarding No Reply (SS-CFNR) and Call</p><p>Deflection
    (SS-CD). These supplementary services apply during call establishment and provide
    diversion of an incoming call to</p><p>another destination.</p><p>Interworking
    between QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate
    at a user of an IP network, or</p><p>a call originating at a user of an IP network
    to terminate at a user of a PISN. This International Standard provides the following</p><p>additional
    capabilities:</p><p>_ a call originating from a PISN and destined for a user of
    an H.323 network to be diverted by the H.323 network to an</p><p>alternative destination;</p><p>_
    a call originating from an H.323 network and destined for a user of a PISN to
    be diverted by the PISN to an alternative</p><p>destination;</p><p>_ a call destined
    for a user of a PISN to be diverted to an alternative destination where that alternative
    destination is in an</p><p>H.323 network;</p><p>_ a call destined for a user of
    an H.323 network to be diverted to an alternative destination where that alternative
    destination</p><p>is in a PISN.</p><p>This International Standard is applicable
    to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG</p><p>and
    an IP network employing H.323.</p>
