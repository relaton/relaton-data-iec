  content: IEC/TR 61289:2011(E) is a technical report giving guidelines to personnel
    in charge of operating high frequency surgical equipment covered by IEC 60601-2-2.
    It intends enabling them to attain the best conditions of safety and efficiency
    for their patients and themselves. It will also be useful to scientific/technical
    staff having responsibility for the maintenance of this equipment. This report
    assumes that the electrical installation of high frequency surgical equipment
    meets national and local regulations for medically used rooms. However, the guidelines
    in this report will still be helpful in utilizing devices not meeting the minimum
    requirements of current international standards. IEC/TR 61289:2011 cancels and
    replaces IEC/TR 61289-1:1994 and IEC/TR 61289-2:1994. It constitutes a technical
    revision and a combination.
