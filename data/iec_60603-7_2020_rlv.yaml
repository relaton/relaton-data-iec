abstract:
- content: "IEC 60603-7:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60603-7:2020
    covers 8-way, unshielded, free and fixed connectors and is intended to specify
    the common dimensions (interface dimensions), mechanical, electrical and environmental
    characteristics and tests for the family of IEC 60603-7-x connectors. These connectors
    are intermateable (according to IEC 61076-1 level 2) and interoperable with other
    IEC 60603-7 series connectors. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition, published in 2008, its Amendment 1:2011 and its Amendment 2:2019. It
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical change with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Revised the
    definitions for intermateability and interoperability; added new definitions.<br
    />\r\n- Corrected dimension line for dimension AZ2 in Figure 5.<br />\r\n- Corrected
    dimension line for dimension F1 in Figure A.1.<br />\r\n- Revised the reference
    to ISO/IEC 11801 to ISO/IEC 11801-1.<br />\r\n- Added lower limiting temperature
    and upper limiting temperature definitions.<br />\r\n- Revised Table 1 to Table
    8 so the column order is Minimum-Nominal-Maximum dimensions (ascending order).<br
    />\r\n- Corrected Table 7: Climatic category and Upper temperature values to 90
    Â°C (to be consistent with the graph in Figure 10 and Note 1 in Figure 10).<br
    />\r\n- Revised the wording in 8.2, contact resistance, for clarification.<br
    />\r\n- Revised Figure 11 and Figure 12 and the wording in the Key below for clarification.<br
    />\r\n- Removed the sentences under the figure in the Introduction.<br />\r\n-
    Added Annex E."
