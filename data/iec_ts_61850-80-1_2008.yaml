abstract:
- content: IEC 61850-80-1:2008(E) gives a guideline on how to exchange information
    from a CDC-based data model (for example IEC 61850) using IEC 60870-5-101 or IEC
    60870-5-104 between substation(s) and control center(s). The goal is to describe
    standardized mapping of device-oriented data models (for example IEC 61850) with
    already defined attributes of CDC's and services (for example IEC 61850-7) onto
    the already defined ASDU's and services of IEC 60870-5-104 or IEC 60870-5-101.
