abstract:
- content: "IEC 60350-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60350-1:2016 specifies
    methods for measuring the performance of electric cooking ranges, ovens, steam
    ovens, and grills for household use. The ovens covered by this standard may be
    with or without microwave function. Manufacturers should define the primary cooking
    function of the appliance microwave function or thermal heat. The primary cooking
    function should be measured with an existing method according to energy consumption.
    If the primary cooking function is declared in the instruction manual as a microwave
    function, IEC 60705 is applied for energy consumption measurement. If the primary
    cooking function is declared as a thermal heat, then IEC 60350-1 is applied for
    energy consumption measurement. If the primary function is not declared by the
    manufacturer, the performance of the microwave function and thermal heat should
    be measured as far as it is possible. This standard defines the main performance
    characteristics of these appliances which are of interest to the user and specifies
    methods for measuring these characteristics. This standard does not specify a
    classification or ranking for performance. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- new definitions for \"set to off mode\" and
    \"set to standby mode\" are included in Clause 3;<br />\r\n- reference to ISO
    80000 regarding rounding;<br />\r\n- more exact determination of the mass of the
    appliances (6.2);<br />\r\n- update of the existing 7.3 in order to improve the
    clarity of procedure;<br />\r\n- additional temperature requirement in 7.4.3 to
    ensure an adequate temperature setting during the energy measurement process;<br
    />\r\n- editorial changes in 7.6.1.3, 7.6.2.1, 7.6.2.2 and 7.6.2.3;<br />\r\n-
    revision of Clause 8 in order to increase the repeatability for the measurements
    for steam ovens;<br />\r\n- Clause 12 \"Standby power\" is renamed to \"Consumption
    measurement of low power modes\" and the content is adapted for IEC 62301:2011;<br
    />\r\n- replacing the supplier for the colouring measurement device in Clause
    C.6, because the previous device is no longer available;<br />\r\n- adaptation
    of Annex A to the new supplier of colouring measurement devices;<br />\r\n- adaptation
    of Annex E;<br />\r\n- measurement method for measuring the consumption of the
    cooling down period is added in the informative, new Annex G;<br />\r\n- measurement
    method to check applied microwave energy during the measurement according to 7.4
    is added in the informative Annex H;<br />\r\n- new Annex I for marking the temperature
    setting for checking the oven temperature.<br />\r\nThe contents of the Interpretation
    Sheet 1 of March 2021 have been included in this copy."
