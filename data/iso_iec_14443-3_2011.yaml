    <p>ISO/IEC 14443-3:2011 describes:</p>

    polling for proximity cards or objects (PICCs) entering the field of a proximity coupling device (PCD);
    the byte format, the frames and timing used during the initial phase of communication between PCDs and PICCs;
    the initial Request and Answer to Request command content;
    methods to detect and communicate with one PICC among several PICCs (anticollision);
    other parameters required to initialize communications between a PICC and PCD;
    optional means to ease and speed up the selection of one PICC among several PICCs based on application criteria.<p>Protocol and commands used by higher layers and by applications and which are used after the initial phase are described in ISO/IEC 14443-4.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14443-3:2011 is applicable to PICCs of Type A and of Type B (as described in ISO/IEC 14443-2).</p>
