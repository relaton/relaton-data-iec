abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19785-4:2010 specifies security block formats (see ISO/IEC 19785-1)
    registered in accordance with ISO/IEC 19785-2 as formats defined by the CBEFF
    biometric organization ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 37, and specifies their registered security
    block format identifiers. [The security block format identifier is recorded in
    the standard biometric header (SBH) of a patron format (or defined by that patron
    format as the only available security block format).]The general-purpose security
    block format provides for specification of whether the biometric data block (BDB)
    is encrypted or the SBH and BDB have integrity applied (or both), and can include
    ACBio instances (see ISO/IEC 24761). This security block provides all necessary
    security parameters, including those used for encryption or integrity.It does
    not restrict the algorithms and parameters used for encryption or integrity, but
    provides for the recording of such algorithms and parameter values.It is a matter
    for profiling to determine, for a particular application area, what algorithms
    and parameter ranges can be used by the generator of a security block, and hence
    what algorithms and parameter ranges have to be supported by the user of a security
    block. This is out of the scope of ISO/IEC 19785-4:2010.The second security block
    is more limited, but simpler (and in particular cannot contain ACBio instances,
    and does not support encryption of the BDB).
