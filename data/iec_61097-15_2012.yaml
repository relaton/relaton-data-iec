abstract:
- content: IEC 61097-15:2012(E) specifies the minimum operational and performance
    requirements, technical characteristics, methods of testing and required test
    results for Inmarsat FB500 ship earth stations (SES), capable of transmitting
    and receiving distress and safety communications, initiating and receiving distress
    priority calls and transmitting and receiving general radiocommunications, using
    radiotelephony (voice), as required within Regulation IV/10.1 and 14.1 of the
    1988 amendments to the 1974 International Convention for the Safety of Life at
    Sea (SOLAS), for use in the GMDSS. This standard incorporates the performance
    standards of IMO Resolution MSC.130(75) and also takes into account the priority
    access (voice pre-emption) requirements of IMO Resolution A.1001(25). This standard
    takes account of IMO Resolution A.694(17) associated with IEC 60945. This standard
    is part of the IEC 61097 series.
