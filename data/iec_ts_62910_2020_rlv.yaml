abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62910:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC TS 62910:2020 provides a
    test procedure for evaluating the performance of Under Voltage Ride-Through (UVRT)
    functions in inverters used in utility-interconnected Photovoltaic (PV) systems.
    This document is most applicable to large systems where PV inverters are connected
    to utility high voltage (HV) distribution systems. However, the applicable procedures
    may also be used for low voltage (LV) installations in locations where evolving
    UVRT requirements include such installations, e.g. single-phase or 3-phase systems.
    The assessed UVRT performance is valid only for the specific configuration and
    operational mode of the inverter under test. Separate assessment is required for
    the inverter in other factory or user-settable configurations, as these may cause
    the inverter UVRT response to behave differently. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition issued in 2015 and constitutes a technical revision.</p>
