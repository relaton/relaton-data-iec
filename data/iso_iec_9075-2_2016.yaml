abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 deﬁnes the data structures and basic operations on
    SQL-data. It provides functional capabilities for creating, accessing, maintaining,
    controlling, and protecting SQL-data.<p>ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 speciﬁes the syntax
    and semantics of a database language:</p><p>- For specifying and modifying the
    structure and the integrity constraints of SQL-data.</p><p>- For declaring and
    invoking operations on SQL-data and cursors.</p><p>- For declaring database language
    procedures.</p><p>- For embedding SQL-statements in a compilation unit that is
    otherwise written in a particular programming language (host language).</p><p>-
    For deriving an equivalent compilation unit in the host language. In that equivalent
    compilation unit, each which invoke an SQL externally-invoked procedure that,
    when executed, has an effect equivalent to exe-cuting the SQL-statement.</p><p>-
    For direct invocation of SQL-statements.</p><p>- To support dynamic preparation
    and execution of SQL-statements.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 provides a vehicle
    for portability of data deﬁnitions and compilation units between SQL-implementations.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    9075-2:2016 provides a vehicle for interconnection of SQL-implementations.</p><p>Implementations
    of this ISO/IEC 9075-2:2016 can exist in environments that also support application
    program-ming languages, end-user query languages, report generator systems, data
    dictionary systems, program library systems, and distributed communication systems,
    as well as various tools for database design, data administration, and performance
    optimization.</p>
