  content: "IEC TS 62600-4:2020 specifies the requirements of the technology qualification
    process for marine renewable technologies. Technology Qualification is a process
    of providing evidence and arguments to support claims that the technology under
    assessment will function reliably in a target operating environment within specific
    limits and with an acceptable level of confidence.<br />\r\nThe Technology Qualification
    process is also assumed in IEC TS 62600-2:2019.<br />\r\nThe objective of this
    document is to provide the necessary practices and technical requirements, regarding
    technology qualification methodology, to support the needs of the IECRE certification
    process for marine renewables energy systems. Technology Qualification may be
    performed at the beginning of the certification process to identify the uncertainties,
    novelties, and modes of failure, mechanisms of failure, risks and risk control
    measures. In addition, Technology Qualification will identify the standards that
    are applicable, to what extent and what adaptation to the technology is required
    to address the risks. The Technology Qualification Plan is the deliverable arising
    from this process and it will provide all necessary actions to achieve certification."
