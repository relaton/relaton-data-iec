abstract:
- content: "This document defines:<br />\r\n- structures and data elements for biometric
    information records (BIRs);<br />\r\n- the concept of a domain of use to establish
    the applicability of a standard or specification that conforms with CBEFF requirements;<br
    />\r\n- the concept of a CBEFF patron format, which is a published BIR format
    specification that complies with CBEFF requirements, specified by a CBEFF patron;<br
    />\r\n- the abstract values and associated semantics of a set of CBEFF data elements
    to be used in the definition of CBEFF patron formats;<br />\r\nThis document describes
    methods to define CBEFF patron formats using CBEFF data elements to specify the
    structure of BIRs, including the standard biometric headers (SBHs).<br />\r\nThis
    document also provides the means for identification of BDB formats in a BIR, but
    the standardization and interoperability of BDB formats is not within the scope
    of this document. This document provides a security block (SB) as a means for
    BIRs to carry information about the encryption of a BDB in the BIR and about integrity
    mechanisms applied to the BIR itself. The structure and content of SBs is not
    within the scope of this document. Further, the specification of encryption mechanisms
    for BDBs and of integrity mechanisms for BIRs is not within the scope of this
    document.<br />\r\nThis document specifies transformations from one CBEFF patron
    format to a different CBEFF patron format.<br />\r\nThe following are not within
    the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- the encoding of the abstract values of
    CBEFF data elements to be used in the specification of CBEFF patron formats; and<br
    />\r\n- protection of the privacy of individuals from inappropriate dissemination
    and use of biometric data."
