abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 76:2008 provides general guidance on the issues to be considered
    in standards for services. On the basis of this guidance, detailed standards can
    be prepared for any service. ISO/IEC Guide 76:2008 provides a checklist which
    can be used by consumer representatives and others participating in the process
    of standards development. Use of the checklist enables full consideration to be
    given to all matters of consumer interest, including the needs of children, older
    persons, persons with disabilities and those from different ethnic and cultural
    heritages.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 76:2008 is relevant to the full range
    of services, whether or not a formal contract is entered into or purchase price
    paid, but it also has relevance for public or charitable services in which there
    is a consumer, a user or a participant, but not necessarily a purchase, e.g. education,
    health and care provision."
