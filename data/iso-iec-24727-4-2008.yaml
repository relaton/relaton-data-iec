    <p>ISO/IEC 24727 defines a set of programming interfaces for interactions between integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic services for multi-sector use. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-4:2008 standardizes the connectivity and security mechanisms between the client-application and the card-application.</p>
    <p>It specifies API-Administration of service-independent and implementation-independent ISO/IEC 24727 compliant modules, including security, that enables action requests to a specific card-application of an integrated circuit card such that, when coupled to data model and content discovery operations, the card-application can be used by a variety of client-applications.</p>
