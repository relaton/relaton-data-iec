    <p>ISO/IEC 18033 specifies encryption systems (ciphers) for the purpose of data confidentiality. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 specifies block ciphers. A block cipher is a symmetric encipherment system with the property that the encryption algorithm operates on a block of plaintext, i.e. a string of bits of a defined length, to yield a block of ciphertext.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 specifies the following algorithms.</p>
    <ul><li>64-bit block ciphers: TDEA, MISTY1, CAST-128.</li><li>128-bit block ciphers: AES, Camellia, SEED.</li></ul>
    <p>NOTE The primary purpose of encryption (or <i>encipherment</i>) techniques is to protect the confidentiality of stored or transmitted data. An encryption algorithm is applied to data (often called <i>plaintext</i> or <i>cleartext</i>) to yield encrypted data (or <i>ciphertext</i>); this process is known as <i>encryption</i>. The encryption algorithm is designed so that the ciphertext yields no information about the plaintext except, perhaps, its length. Associated with every encryption algorithm is a corresponding <i>decryption algorithm</i>, which transforms ciphertext back into its original plaintext.</p>
