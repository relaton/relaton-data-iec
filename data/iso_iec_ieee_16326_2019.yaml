abstract:
- content: "1.1 Purpose<br />\r\nThis document is intended to aid project managers
    in managing to successful conclusion those projects concerned with systems, including
    software systems.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the required content of the
    project management plan (PMP). This document also quotes the extracted purpose
    and outcome statements from the technical management processes of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207, and adds detailed guidance for managing projects
    that use these processes for systems, including software systems.<p>1.2 Field
    of application<br />\r\nThis document is written for those who use or plan to
    use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 on projects dealing with systems,
    including software systems, regardless of project scope, products, methodology,
    size or complexity. The field of application of this document spans the whole
    system or software life cycle and addresses all project management roles, specifically:<br
    />\r\n— those responsible for establishing and continuously improving their organization's
    policies for implementing ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 system life cycle processes and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 software life cycle processes;<br />\r\n— those responsible for executing
    any ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 system life cycle process or ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 software
    life cycle process at a project level.<br />\r\n— organizations or individuals
    subcontracting a project management effort.<br />\r\nIn many organizations, the
    various responsibilities of project management are assigned to more than one person.
    Where the term \"project manager\" is used in this document, the guidance, advice
    or normative requirement is taken as applying to the applicable role within the
    organization.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to provide guidance for two-party
    situations and can be equally applied where the two parties are from the same
    organization. This document can also be used by a single party as self-imposed
    tasks.<br />\r\nThis document can also serve as guidance in multi-party situations,
    where high risks are inherent in the supply and integration of complex software-based
    systems, and procurement can involve several vendors, organizations or contracting
    parties.</p><p>1.3 Limitations<br />\r\nThe normative content specifications for
    PMPs and the guidance for application of the technical management processes have
    general application across the scope of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,
    but are developed with a focus on projects dealing with systems with a significant
    software element, and software systems.</p>"
