    <p>ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013 specifies syntax and semantics of the data types and tools common to the tools defined in the other parts of ISO/IEC 23005, such as basic data types which are used as basic building blocks in more than one of the tools in ISO/IEC 23005, colour-related basic types which are used in light and colour‑related tools to help in specifying colour-related characteristics of the devices or commands, and time stamp types which can be used in device commands, and sensed information to specify timing related information.</p>
    <p>Several classification schemes which are used in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005 are also defined in Annex A of ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013. Other tools to be developed are included in ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013, if those tools are to be used with the tools defined in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005. Most of the tools defined in ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013 are not intended to be used alone, but to be used as a part or as a supporting tool of other tools defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 23005.</p>
