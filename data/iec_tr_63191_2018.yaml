abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63191:2018(E) specifies recommendations about power quality measurement
    and assessment within installations.<br />\r\nIEC TR 63191:2018 outlines the various
    phases needed for the establishment of a demand side power quality measurement
    plan for buildings and industry installations.<br />\r\nSuch a power quality measurement
    plan will enable the optimization of the energy availability and efficiency, improve
    the assets lifetime and facilitate the resolutions of power quality problems.
    A power quality measurement plan encompasses the following stages:<br />\r\n•
    definition of the context, objectives and constraints;<br />\r\n• assessment of
    the initial power quality situation;<br />\r\n• definition of an action plan for
    the improvement of the power quality situation;<br />\r\n• implementation of the
    power quality measuring system;<br />\r\n• exploitation of the measurement system
    for the improvement of the power quality situation;<br />\r\n• maintenance of
    the measurement system.<br />\r\nIEC TR 63191:2018 will also help facility managers
    to tailor their measurement plan to the specific needs of the electrical system
    under their control. It addresses all the disturbances present in such networks,
    but does not cover the disturbances present in public electrical distribution
    networks (supply side) as they are governed by specific documents such as EN 50160
    and IEC TS 62749."
