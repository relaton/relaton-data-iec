abstract:
- content: Specifies the measuring equipment and techniques to be used in assessing
    the conducted electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated by stabilized power
    supplies and especially by switched-mode power supplies. Relates mainly to power
    supplies for which the source current required does not exceed 25 A. The techniques
    employed follow the general principles given in CISPR publications. Requirements
    for measurements of radiated interference have not been included in this standard.
