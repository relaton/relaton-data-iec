abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 12862:2009 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm and an 80 mm dual layer DVD recordable disk to enable the interchange
    of such disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and the
    recorded signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone,
    the format of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing
    for information interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as
    a DVD recordable disk for dual layer (DVD-R for DL).\n\nISO/IEC 12862:2009 specifies
    the following:\n\n120 mm and 80 mm nominal diameter disks that may be either single
    or double sided; \nthe conditions for conformance; \nthe environments in which
    the disk is to be operated and stored; \nthe mechanical and physical characteristics
    of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;
    \nthe format of the pre-recorded information on an unrecorded disk, including
    the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes
    and the coding method used; \nthe format of the data and the recorded information
    on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the
    error correcting codes and the coding method used; \nthe characteristics of the
    signals from pre-recorded and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data processing
    systems to read the pre-recorded information and to write to the disks; \nthe
    characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing
    systems to read the data from the disk. \nISO/IEC 12862:2009 provides for interchange
    of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems."
