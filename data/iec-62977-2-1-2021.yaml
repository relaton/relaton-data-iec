  content: "IEC 62977-2-1:2021(E) specifies standard measurement conditions and measuring
    methods for determining the optical characteristics of electronic display modules
    and systems. These methods apply to emissive and transmissive direct view displays
    that render real 2D images on a flat panel. This document evaluates the optical
    characteristics of these displays under darkroom conditions. This document applies
    to the testing of display performance in response to standard analogue or digital
    input signals that are not absolute luminance encoded. The input signal is relative
    RGB without metadata information that codes for real luminance, colour space or
    colour coordinates. These methods are limited to input signals with typical OETFs
    such as defined in IEC 61966-2-1, ITU BT. Rec. 601, ITU BT. Rec.709, and ITU BT.
    Rec.2020. The tests in this document are not approved for use with HDR input signals.<br
    />\r\nNOTE A flat panel or flat panel display is a display with a flat surface
    and minimal depth that emits visible light from the surface. The display is subdivided
    into an array of electronically driven pixels which can be light valves modulating
    a backlight, or self-luminous. Emissive/transmissive/reflective hybrid displays<strong>
    </strong>can be flat panel or flat panel displays."
