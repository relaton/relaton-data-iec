  content: "IEC 60034-2-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-2-1:2024
    is intended to establish methods of determining efficiencies from tests, and also
    to specify methods of obtaining specific losses. This document applies to DC machines
    and to AC synchronous and induction machines of all sizes within the scope of
    IEC 60034-1 rated for mains operation. These methods may be applied to other types
    of machines such as rotary converters, AC commutator motors and single-phase induction
    motors. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC 60034-2-1
    published in 2014. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Harmonization of layout and requirements
    with IEC 60034-2-2 and IEC 60034-2-3."
