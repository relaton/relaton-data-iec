abstract:
- content: "Reviews methods for measuring magnetically hard materials using pulsed
    field magnetometers. \nThe methods of measurement of the magnetic properties of
    magnetically hard materials have been specified in IEC 60404-5 for closed magnetic
    circuits and in IEC 60404-7 for open magnetic circuits. The measurement result
    of the magnetic properties of magnetically hard materials at elevated temperatures
    is given in IEC 61807. \nPulsed field magnetometers have been developed to provide
    rapid measurement facilities to match high speed production rates with 100 % quality
    control. \nThe object of this report is to describe the principles and practical
    implications of pulsed field magnetometry in order to enable the full potential
    of the technique to be considered, including its application using small and large
    magnets of varying geometries, to various magnetic field strengths and frequencies."
