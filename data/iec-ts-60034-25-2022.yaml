  content: "IEC TS 60034-25:2022 describes the performance characteristics of AC electrical
    machines for use on converter supplies. For electrical machines specifically designed
    for converter duty application design features are defined. It also specifies
    the interface parameters and interactions between the electrical machine and the
    converter including installation guidance as part of a power drive system, but
    except for the voltage at the power interface which is described in IEC TS 61800-8.
    This fourth edition of IEC TS 60034-25 cancels and replaces the third edition,
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. The definitions of a converter capable motor
    and a converter duty motor are added.<br />\r\nb. Clause 18 modified to include
    the performance expectations of a converter capable motor.<br />\r\nc. Clause
    8 modified to update shaft currents section.<br />\r\nd. Annex D added to define
    the derating requirements."
