  content: "<p>This document describes a standardized method to assess the energy
    efficiency of commercial storage products in both active and idle states of operation.
    A taxonomy is defined that classifies storage products in terms of operational
    profiles and supported features. Test definition and execution rules for measuring
    the power efficiency of each taxonomy category are described; these include test
    sequence, test configuration, instrumentation, benchmark driver, IO profiles,
    measurement interval, and metric stability assessment. Qualitative heuristic tests
    are defined to verify the existence of several capacity optimization methods.
    Resulting power efficiency metrics are defined as ratios of idle capacity or active
    operations during a selected stable measurement interval to the average measured
    power. </p>"
