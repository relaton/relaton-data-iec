  content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is intended for use in a high-performance,
    general-purpose multistation network and is designed for efficient operation with
    a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token Ring Architecture with optical
    fiber as the transmission medium. FDDI provides for hundreds of stations operating
    over an extent of tens of kilometres. To evaluate the conformance of this particular
    implementation, it is necessary to have a statement of which capabilities and
    options have been implemented for a given OSI protocol. Such a statement is called
    a Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS). FDDI PICS Proforma specifies
    the protocol features that are mandatory and optional within the base standards.
    This document is supported by four separate Abstract Test Suite (ATS) standards
    that specify the test architecture required to prove conformance of an FDDI implementation.
