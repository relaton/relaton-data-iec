    ISO/IEC 20006-2:2015 provides an information model for competency proficiency and its level. Moreover, it presents several use cases that can be used by software developers, implementers, and architects of human resources systems and learning systems. These use cases will support management and exchange of competency information within information technology systems used for learning, education, and training.

    NOTE: This International Standard is based on work completed in ISO/IEC TR 24763.
