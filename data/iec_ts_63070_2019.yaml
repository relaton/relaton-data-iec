abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63070:2019 is applicable to ultrasonic equipment designed for the
    medical field of application. It covers both diagnostic and therapeutic (physiotherapy
    and HITU) equipment.<br />\r\nThis document describes transducer evaluation by
    the infrared imaging technique using a split TMM-phantom for qualitative and quantitative
    estimation of temperature distributions in tissue-mimicking material, resulting
    from absorption of ultrasound and from heating of the transducer itself.<br />\r\nThis
    document also describes a method to measure transducer-surface temperature, while
    the transducer is driven under the still-air condition."
