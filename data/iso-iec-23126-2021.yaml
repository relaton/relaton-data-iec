    <p>This document specifies a framework to describe and organize learning resources in ubiquitous learning. It provides features to enable dynamic aggregation of resources in different learning contexts, in which the social interactions are recorded to facilitate social learning. The features that reflect the evolutionary history of resources based on learners’ contributions are also defined.</p>
    <p>The framework includes an aggregation model, content organization, context-aware learning services, and learning cell service provider.</p>
