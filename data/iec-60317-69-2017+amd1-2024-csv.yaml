  content: "IEC 60317-69:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular aluminium winding wire of class 220 with a dual coating. The underlying
    coating is based on polyester or polyesterimide resin, which may be modified providing
    it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all specified
    wire requirements. The superimposed coating is based on polyamide-imide resin.<br
    />\r\nThe range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this standard is:<br
    />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm - max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm
    - max. 5,60 mm.<br />\r\nWires of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this part
    of IEC 60317 and apply to the complete range of conductors. The specified combinations
    of width and thickness as well as the specific ratio width/thickness are given
    in IEC 60317. This publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60317-0-9:2015."
