  content: "IEC 60335-2-81:2015+A1:2017+A2:2020 deals with the safety of electric
    foot warmers and heating mats for household and similar purposes, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V. Appliances not intended for normal household
    use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account persons
    (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of
    experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without
    supervision or instruction. It also does not take into account children playing
    with the appliance. It was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010)
    of that standard. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2002, its Amendment 1 (2007) and its Amendment 2 (2011). It constitutes a technical
    revision. The principal changes in this edition as compared with the second edition
    of IEC 60335-2-81 are as follows (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\n- requirements
    for washable appliances (5.3, 7.1, 7.6, 7.12);<br />\r\n- requirements for controls
    in flexible cords (15.1.1, 24.2) and requirements for appliance inlets (22.105,
    24.1.5, 29.1.3). The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that
    equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period
    following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to
    make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves
    for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the committee
    that the content of this standard be adopted for implementation nationally not
    earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of its publication.
    This publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60335-1:2010. This consolidated
    version consists of the third edition (2015) and its amendment 1 (2017). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.<strong> This consolidated
    version consists of the third edition (2015), its amendment 1 (2017) and its amendment
    2 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.</strong><br
