    Specifies a method of exchanging time-critical and non-time-critical data through local-area networks by mapping ACSI to MMS and ISO/IEC 8802-3 frames. MMS services and protocol are specified to operate over full OSI and TCP compliant communications profiles. The use of MMS allows provisions for supporting both centralized and distributed architectures. This standard includes the exchange of real-time data indications, control operations, report notification.
