  content: "IEC TS 62257-301:2025 specifies the design and implementation of hybrid
    off-grid solar systems, where solar energy provides energy to a load in conjunction
    with other sources of energy. Such systems can either include or not include an
    energy storage system. There are a variety of different system architectures and
    applications, and many ways in which these energy sources can be combined. This
    document distinguishes between different sorts of hybrid system applications and
    gives guidance on the design and integration of these systems.<br />\r\nIt applies
    to single-phase and three-phase applications, and it covers situations where grid
    is available as an additional source of power for charging batteries and maintaining
    system reliability, but this document does not cover situations in which energy
    is fed back into a utility grid, although such systems can incidentally possess
    this function."
