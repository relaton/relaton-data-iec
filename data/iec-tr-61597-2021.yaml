  content: "IEC 61597:2021(E) which is a Technical Report provides information with
    regard to conductors specified in IEC 61089 and other aluminium and aluminium
    steel conductors. Such information includes properties of conductors and useful
    methods of calculation. The following chapters are included in this document.<br
    />\r\n– current carrying capacity of conductors: Calculation method and typical
    example<br />\r\n– alternating current resistance, inductive and capacitive reactances<br
    />\r\n– elongation of conductors: Thermal and stress-strain data<br />\r\n– conductor
    creep<br />\r\n– loss of strength of aluminium wires due to high temperatures<br
    />\r\nIt is noted that this document does not discuss all theories and available
    methods for calculating conductor properties, but provides users with simple methods
    that provide acceptable accuracies.<strong> </strong><br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1995. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Addition of
    Clause 2 and Clause 3 since the “Normative references” and “Terms and definitions”
    clauses are mandatory elements of the text according to the new IEC template.<br
    />\r\nb) In Clause 6, addition of new kinds of aluminium alloy and aluminium clad
    steel and their values of temperature coefficients of resistance.<br />\r\nc)
    In Clause 6, addition of guidelines for the calculation of AC resistance taken
    into account hysteresis and eddy current losses.<br />\r\nd) In Clause 7, addition
    of the values of coefficient of linear expansion of aluminium alloy conductor
    aluminium-clad steel reinforced series.<br />\r\ne) Deletion of Clause 8 “Calculation
    of maximum conductor length on drums” in the last version.<br />\r\nf) Annex A,
    replaced by “A practical example of CCC calculation”.<br />\r\ng) Annex B, replaced
    by “Indicative conditions for CCC calculation”."
