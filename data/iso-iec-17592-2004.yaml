  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17592:2004 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of an optical disk, identified as DVD Rewritable Disk (DVD-RAM), to enable interchange
    of such disks. It specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many times
    using the phase change method. Two Types are specified that differ only by their
    diameter of 120 mm and 80 mm, and the resulting difference of capacity.</p>"
