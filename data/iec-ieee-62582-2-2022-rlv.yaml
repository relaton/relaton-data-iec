  content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-2:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC/IEEE 62582-2:2022
    contains methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in
    instrumentation and control systems using the indenter measurement technique in
    the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes
    the requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement system and measurement
    conditions, and the reporting of the measurement results. This document is intended
    for application to non-energised equipment. This document is published as an IEC/IEEE
    Dual Logo standard. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2011, and its Amendment 1:2016. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Modification of the title;<br />\r\n- Consideration of publication of IEC/IEEE
    60780-323.</p>"
