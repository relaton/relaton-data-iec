    <p>-      specifies activities and processes to be implemented for engineering the integration of systems-of-interest throughout the life cycle (systems made of products and/or services; see Note 1),</p>
    <p>-      provides guidance for the integration process and its relationships to other system life cycle processes as described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288,</p>
    <p>-      specifies the information items to be produced through the implementation of the integration engineering (integration process and its relationships to other system life cycle processes),</p>

    <p>-      those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, products and services related to those systems, regardless of project scope, methodology, size or complexity, and</p>
    <p>-      anyone performing integration engineering activities to aid in ensuring that the application of the integration process and its relationships to other system life cycle processes conform to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.</p>
