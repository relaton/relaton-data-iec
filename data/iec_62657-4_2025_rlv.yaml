abstract:
- content: "IEC 62657-4:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62657-4:2025
    specifies a concept and methods for central coordination (CC) of automation applications
    using wireless communications to extend the coexistence management according to
    IEC 62657-2. It establishes system elements, interfaces and relationships for
    a central coordination. Functions, data, and data exchange for assessing and maintaining
    the coexistence state are specified.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the central
    coordination point (CCP) approach as one example of the usage of the formal description
    given in IEC 62657-3. This document is applicable to develop, implement, or modify
    procedures or solutions.<br />\r\nThis document provides requirements for automated
    coexistence management systems.<br />\r\nThis document provides requirements for:<br
    />\r\n– determination of the coexistence state,<br />\r\n– automated coexistence
    management procedures,<br />\r\n– CC amendments for existing wireless communication
    solutions,<br />\r\n– CC functions that coordinate legacy and new wireless communication
    systems,<br />\r\n– CC sequences and message formats for data exchange.<br />\r\nThis
    document is not restricted to a specific radio frequency range nor is it restricted
    to a specific wireless communication technology.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) The data item (parameter) to be exchanged between CCP and CMWCA and CMWD
    to ensure interoperability between CCP providers and device providers.<br />\r\nb)
    The sequence of services conducted between CCP and CMWCA and CMWD are now defined.
    When the CCP providers and the device providers implement similar process, clearly
    defined sequence and unified execution specifications ensure interoperability
    as expected.<br />\r\nc) The message formats of sequence diagram to be exchanged
    between CCP and CMWCA and CMWD are defined. By defining the message formats, the
    hierarchical structure of each data (parameter), and implementing the same message
    format by the CCP provider and the device provider, enables to exchange data correctly
    and ensure interoperability."
