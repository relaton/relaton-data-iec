  content: IEC 62047-29:2017(E) specifies a relaxation test method for measuring electromechanical
    properties of freestanding conductive thin films for micro-electromechanical systems
    (MEMS) under controlled strain and room temperature. Freestanding thin films of
    conductive materials are extensively utilized in MEMS, opto-electronics, and flexible/wearable
    electronics products. Freestanding thin films in the products experience external
    and internal stresses which could be relaxed even under room temperature during
    a period of operation, and this relaxation leads to time-dependent variation of
    electrical performances of the products. This test method is valid for isotropic,
    homogeneous, and linearly viscoelastic materials.
