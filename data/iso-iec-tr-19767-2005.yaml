  content: <p>ISO/IEC TR 19767:2004 specifies an extension to the module facilities
    and the syntax of definition of procedures in the programming language Fortran.
    The Fortran language is specified by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004. The extension allows
    program authors to develop the implementation details of concepts in new program
    units, called "submodules," that cannot be accessed directly by use association,
    and to define the interface and implementation of procedures separately. The module
    facility and the syntax of definition of procedures in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004 are
    changed by this Technical Report in such a way as to be upwardly compatible with
    ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004.</p>
