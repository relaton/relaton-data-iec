    <p>ISO/IEC 9594 has been produced to facilitate the interconnection of information processing systems to provide directory services. A set of such systems, together with the directory information that they hold, can be viewed as an integrated whole, called the Directory. The information held by the Directory, collectively known as the Directory Information Base (DIB), is typically used to facilitate communication between, with or about objects such as application entities, people, terminals and distribution lists.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9594-1:2014 introduces the concepts of the Directory and the DIB (Directory Information Base) and overviews the services and capabilities which they provide.</p>
