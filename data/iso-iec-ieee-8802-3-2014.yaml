  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3:2014 specifies Ethernet local area network operation
    for selected speeds of operation from 1 Mb/s to 100 Gb/s using a common media
    access control (MAC) specification and management information base (MIB). The
    Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) MAC protocol
    specifies shared medium (half duplex) operation, as well as full duplex operation.
    Speed specific Media Independent Interfaces (MIIs) allow use of selected Physical
    Layer devices (PHY) for operation over coaxial, twisted-pair or fibre-optic cables.
    System considerations for multisegment shared access networks describe the use
    of Repeaters that are defined for operational speeds up to 1000 Mb/s. Local Area
    Network (LAN) operation is supported at all speeds. Other specified capabilities
    include various PHY types for access networks, PHYs suitable for metropolitan
    area network applications, and the provision of power over selected twisted-pair
    PHY types.</p>"
