  content: "IEC 62541-4:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62541-4:2025
    defines the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Services. The Services defined are
    the collection of abstract Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that are implemented by
    OPC UA Servers and called by OPC UA Clients. All interactions between OPC UA Clients
    and Servers occur via these Services. The defined Services are considered abstract
    because no particular RPC mechanism for implementation is defined in this document.
    IEC 62541‑6 specifies one or more concrete mappings supported for implementation.
    For example, one mapping in IEC 62541‑6 is to UA-TCP UA-SC UA-Binary. In that
    case the Services described in this document appear as OPC UA Binary encoded payload,
    secured with OPC UA Secure Conversation and transported via OPC UA TCP. Not all
    OPC UA Servers implement all of the defined Services. IEC 62541‑7 defines the
    Profiles that dictate which Services must be implemented in order to be compliant
    with a particular Profile. A BNF (Backus-Naur form) for browse path names is described
    in Annex A. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) addition of new definitions to Method Call Service to allow
    optional Method arguments;<br />\r\nb)addition of reference to SystemStatusChangeEventType
    for event monitored item error scenarios;<br />\r\nc) enhancement of the general
    description of how determining if a Certificate is trusted;<br />\r\nd) addition
    of support for ECC;<br />\r\ne) addition of revisedAggregateConfiguration to AggregateFilterResult
    structure;<br />\r\nf) addition of INVALID to the BrowseDirection enumeration
    data type;<br />\r\ng) addition of INVALID to the TimestampsToReturn enumeration
    data type;<br />\r\nh) addition of definitions that make sure the subscription
    functionality works if retransmission queues are optional;<br />\r\ni) addition
    of client checks has been added to be symmetric to the Server Certificate check
    has been added;<br />\r\nj) clarification that ‘local’ top level domain is not
    appended by server into certificate and not checked by client when returned from
    LDS-ME;<br />\r\nk) addition of a definition for expiration behaviour of IssuedIdentityTokens;<br
    />\r\nl) addition of status code Good_PasswordChangeRequired to ActivateSession;<br
    />\r\nm) restriction of AdditionalInfo to servers in debug mode;<br />\r\nn) addition
    of new status code Bad_ServerTooBusy;<br />\r\no) addition of definition for cases
    where server certificate must be contained in GetEndpoints response."
