abstract:
- content: "The main goal of ISO/IEC TR 14496-9:2008 is to facilitate a more widespread
    use of the MPEG-4 standard.<br /><br />\r\nDesign methodologies of the EDA industry
    have evolved from schematics to Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) to address
    the needs of the vast number of gates available on a single device. The increased
    number of gates allowed more elaborate algorithms to be deployed but also required
    a shift in design paradigm to handle the complexity created. Through HDLs, more
    complicated systems could be designed faster through the enabling technology of
    synthesis of the HDL code towards different silicon technologies where trade offs
    could be explored. Now the EDA industry again faces challenges where HDLs may
    not provide the level of abstraction needed for system designers to evaluate system
    level parameters and complexity issues. There have been a number of tool investigations
    under way to address this problem. Profiling tools aid in exposing bottlenecks
    in an abstract way so that early design decisions can be made. C to gates tools
    allow a C based simulation environment while also enabling direct synthesis to
    gates for hardware acceleration.<br /><br />\r\nIn conclusion, it is the aim of
    this ISO/IEC TR 14496-9:2008 to enable more widespread use of the MPEG-4 standard
    through reference hardware descriptions and close integration with ISO/IEC TR
    14496-7 (MPEG-4 Part 7 Optimized Reference Software). Additionally, it is aimed
    that exposure to such a platform will enable a more systematic way to investigate
    the complexity of new codecs and open up the algorithm search space with an order
    of magnitude more compute cycles."
