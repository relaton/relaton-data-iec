    and platform technologies, and a process that can be used to describe different
    combinations or bundles of media and platform technologies, which are needed to
    perform identified functions or to support a class of applications for learners
    within or across various information technology environments. It provides examples
    of how and when bundles of technologies can be defined to support learning, education
