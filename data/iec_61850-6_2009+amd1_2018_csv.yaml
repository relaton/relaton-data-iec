abstract:
- content: "IEC 61850-6:2009+A1:2018 specifies a file format for describing communication-related
    IED (Intelligent Electronic Device) configurations and IED parameters, communication
    system configurations, switch yard (function) structures, and the relations between
    them. The main purpose of this format is to exchange IED capability descriptions,
    and SA system descriptions between IED engineering tools and the system engineering
    tool(s) of different manufacturers in a compatible way. The main changes with
    respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- functional extensions
    added based on changes in other Parts of IEC 61850, especially in IEC 61850-7-2
    and IEC 61850-7-3;<br />\r\n- functional extensions concerning the engineering
    process, especially for configuration data exchange between system configuration
    tools, added;<br />\r\n- clarifications and corrections.<strong>This consolidated
    version consists of the second edition (2009) and its amendment 1 (2018). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong> This publication
    is of core relevance for Smart Grid."
