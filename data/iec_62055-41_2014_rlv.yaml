abstract:
- content: "IEC 62055-41:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62055-41:2014-05(en-fr)
    specifies the application layer protocol of the STS for transferring units of
    credit and other management information from a point of sale (POS) system to an
    STS-compliant payment meter in a one-way token carrier system. It is primarily
    intended for application with electricity payment meters without a tariff employing
    energy-based tokens, but may also have application with currency-based token systems
    and for services other than electricity. It is intended for use by manufacturers
    of payment meters that have to accept tokens that comply with the STS and also
    by manufacturers of POS systems that have to produce STS-compliant tokens and
    is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62055-5x series. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition issued in 2007. It constitutes a technical revision.
    The main technical changes are:<br />\r\n- Class 2 token is extended to include
    credit transfer for gas and water with associated extensions in the display/test
    tokens.<br />\r\n- MfrCode is extended from 2 to 4 digits.<br />\r\n- Three token
    identifier base dates are defined to provide for more frequent key changes with
    TID roll-over procedures.<br />\r\n- A code of practice for the management of
    TID roll-over key changes in association with the revised set of base dates.<br
    />\r\n- Some clarifications and additional examples have been added."
