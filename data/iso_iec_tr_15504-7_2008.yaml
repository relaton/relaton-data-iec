abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15504 provides a framework for the assessment of processes. This
    framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring,
    controlling, and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution
    and support of products and services.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 15504-7:2008 defines
    the conditions for an assessment of organizational maturity; it defines a framework
    for determining organizational maturity, based upon profiles of process capability
    derived from process assessment, and defines the conditions under which such assessments
    are valid.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 15504-7:2008, organizational maturity is
    an expression of the extent to which an organization consistently implements processes
    within a defined scope that contributes to the achievement of its business goals
    (current or projected). An Organizational Maturity Model is based upon one or
    more specified Process Assessment Model(s), and addresses the domains and contexts
    for use of the Process Reference Model(s) from which the Process Assessment Model(s)
    are derived.<br /><br />\r\nThe assessment of organizational maturity is undertaken
    through the performance of process assessment as specified in ISO/IEC 15504-2.
    Specific conditions are defined in ISO/IEC TR 15504-7:2008 relating to the process
    scope of the organizational maturity assessment, the organizational scope of the
    assessment (which has to be specified as representing the elements characterised
    by the organizational maturity rating), and the data collection strategy (which
    needs to ensure that the results of the assessment are representative of the organizational
    scope). On completion of the assessment, the set of process profiles established
    for the organization determine the rating of the level of organizational maturity
    based on the framework defined in ISO/IEC 15504-7, as specified in the relevant
    Organizational Maturity Model.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 15504-7:2008 also contains
    guidance on implementing the requirements for constructing an Organizational Maturity
    Model; on performing assessments of organizational maturity; and on the application
    of organizational maturity ratings for process improvement and capability determination."
