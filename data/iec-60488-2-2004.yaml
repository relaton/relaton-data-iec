  content: This Dual Logo International Standard is the result of an agreement between
    the IEC and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE).
    The original IEEE Standard was submitted to the IEC for consideration under the
    agreement, and the resulting IEC/IEEE Dual Logo International Standard has been
    published in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives. It specifies a set of codes
    to be used by devices connected via the IEEE 488.1 bus, defines communication
    protocols necessary to effect applications implementation independent device-dependent
    message exchanges and further defines common commands and characteristics useful
    in instrument system applications
