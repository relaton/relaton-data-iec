  content: 'Deals with the safety of hand-held motor-operated or magnetically driven
    electric tools. The rated voltage of the tools is not more than 250 V for single-phase
    a.c. or d.c., and 440 V for three-phase a.c. tools. It covers tools with an electric
    heating element. It also covers hand-held tools which can be mounted on a support
    for use as fixed tools. This standard does not apply to: tools used in explosive
    atmospheres, tools for preparing and processing food, tools for medical purposes
    (see IEC 60611), and heating tools which are covered by IEC 60335-2-45.'
