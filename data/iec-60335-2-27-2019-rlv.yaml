  content: "IEC 60335-2-27:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-27:2019
    deals with the safety of electrical appliances incorporating emitters for exposing
    the skin to optical radiation (wavelength 100 nm to 1 mm), for household and similar
    use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances.<br />\r\nBattery-operated appliances and other
    DC supplied appliances are within the scope of this standard. Dual supply appliances,
    either mains-supplied or battery-operated, are regarded as battery-operated appliances
    when operated in the battery mode.<br />\r\nAs far as practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons using the appliances in tanning salons, beauty parlours and similar
    premises or at home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n–
    persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities or
    lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities;<br />\r\n– IEC 60598-1 is applicable
    as far as is reasonable.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances
    for skin or hair care (IEC 60335-2-23);<br />\r\n– sauna heating appliances and
    infrared cabins (IEC 60335-2-53);<br />\r\n– cosmetic and beauty care appliances
    incorporating lasers and intense light sources (IEC 60335-2-113)<br />\r\n– appliances
    for medical purposes (IEC 60601);<br />\r\n– appliances that use UV radiation
    for purposes other than tanning the skin;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be
    used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a
    corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis sixth edition
    cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2009, Amendment 1:2012 and
    Amendment 2:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n– aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5, and its Amendments
    1 and 2;<br />\r\n– luminous transmission has been defined (3.1.102);<br />\r\n–
    requirements for testing parts of the appliance that are operated unattended are
    added (30.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest
    edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis of
    the fifth edition (2010) of that standard.<br />\r\nKeywords: Tanning, Tanning
