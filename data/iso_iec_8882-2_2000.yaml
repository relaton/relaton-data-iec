abstract:
- content: <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8882 defines an abstract test suite for testing
    the conformance of the Data Link Layer of an IUT with</p><p>respect to ISO/IEC
    7776 (1986, 1995) or the ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1980, 1984, 1988, 1993).</p><p>Conformance
    of a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) to the above ISO International Standard or
    ITU-T Recommendations is</p><p>tested using a dedicated circuit between the tester
    and the DTE. It is noted that ITU-T Recommendations X.25 (1980), X.25</p><p>(1984),
    X.25 (1988) and X.25 (1993) are written from the perspective of a DCE and therefore
    do not always explicitly specify the</p><p>DTE's operation. In such cases it is
    assumed that recommended operation of a DTE is included by implication because
    of the</p><p>need to communicate with X.25 DCE's. This part of ISO/IEC 8882 excludes
    the testing of the LAP procedures given in the ITU-T</p><p>Recommendations.</p><p>NOTE
    Test cases for extended mode operation (Modulo 128), multilink procedure and DTE-DTE
    operation as per ISO/IEC 7776 are for</p><p>further study.</p><p>The tests in
    this part of ISO/IEC 8882 are designed for six possible interworking situations,
    shown in Figure 1. This part</p><p>specifies tests for all six cases shown in
    Figure 1, but recognizes that not every test may apply to a particular DTE. A
    test</p><p>selection procedure has to be performed to determine the applicability
    of a test to a particular DTE. Such selection will be based</p><p>on the PICS
    and the PIXIT.</p><p/><p><strong>Figure 1 — Testing X.25-DTE/DCE and X.25-DTE/DTE
    Interworking</strong></p><p>In the rest of this part of ISO/IEC 8882, the term
    "X.25 standards" means all four of ITU-T Recommendations X.25 (1980), X.25</p><p>(1984),
    X.25 (1988), X.25 (1993), and International Standards ISO/IEC 7776 (1995) and
    ISO/IEC 7776 (1986), unless stated</p><p>otherwise.</p>
