abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-9:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-9:2019
    deals with the safety of electric portable appliances for household and similar
    purposes that have a cooking function such as baking, roasting and grilling, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that
    are within the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n– barbecues for indoor use;<br
    />\r\n– breadmakers;<br />\r\n– candy floss appliances;<br />\r\n– contact grills
    (griddles);<br />\r\n– cookers;<br />\r\n– food dehydrators;<br />\r\n– hotplates;<br
    />\r\n– induction wok hotplates;<br />\r\n– pop-corn makers;<br />\r\n– portable
    ovens;<br />\r\n– raclette grills;<br />\r\n– radiant grills;<br />\r\n– roasters;<br
    />\r\n– rotary grills;<br />\r\n– rotisseries;<br />\r\n– toasters;<br />\r\n–
    waffle irons;<br />\r\nAppliances intended for normal household and similar use
    and that may also be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms,
    are within the scope of this standard. However, if the appliance is intended to
    be used professionally to process food for commercial consumption, the appliance
    is not considered to be for household and similar use only.<br />\r\nAs far as
    is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nHowever,
    in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements could be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– stationary ovens
    and stationary grills (IEC 60335-2-6);<br />\r\n– warming plates (IEC 60335-2-12);<br
    />\r\n– frying pans and deep fat fryers (IEC 60335-2-13);<br />\r\n– microwave
    ovens (IEC 60335-2-25);<br />\r\n– barbecues for outdoor use (IEC 60335-2-78);<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to burn charcoal or similar combustible fuels;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended for commercial catering;<br />\r\n– appliances intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis seventh
    edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2008, Amendment 1:2012
    and Amendment 2:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n– aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5, and its Amendments
    1 and 2;<br />\r\n– revises the abnormal tests for a toaster (19.11.2, 19.102).<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis of the fifth edition
    (2010) of that standard."
