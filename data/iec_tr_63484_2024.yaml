abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63484:2024 information about fungal growth on the outer sheath
    of optical fibre cables and on the inner components of the cable. It also provides
    guidance for specifying fungus resistance performance of optical cable outer sheath
    and internal cable components, including recommendations for fungus resistance
    test method as well as evaluation after test.<br />\r\nThis document applies to
    optical fibre cables for use with telecommunication equipment and devices employing
    similar techniques, and to hybrid telecommunication cables having a combination
    of both optical fibres and electrical conductors.<br />\r\nSince conditions suitable
    for fungal growth include high relative humidity and a warm atmosphere, the document
    is applicable to optical cables intended for transportation, storage and use under
    such environment over certain period, for instance, some days at least."
