abstract:
- content: 'IEC/TR 62627-03-03:2013(E) describes the investigation results of high-power
    reliability for metal-doped optical fibre plug-style attenuators. This report
    contains the high-power test results for metal-doped optical fibre SC plug-style
    optical attenuators, the thermal simulation results and the analysis of degradation
    modes, long-term reliability test results under high-power conditions and the
    derivation of maximum limit of optical power for guaranteeing long-term operation.
