  content: "IEC 61215-1-4:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61215-1-4:2021
    lays down requirements for the design qualification of terrestrial photovoltaic
    modules suitable for long-term operation in open-air climates. The useful service
    life of modules so qualified will depend on their design, their environment and
    the conditions under which they are operated. Test results are not construed as
    a quantitative prediction of module lifetime. This document is intended to apply
    to all thin-film Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 based terrestrial flat plate modules. As such
    it addresses special requirements for testing of this technology supplementing
    IEC 61215-1:2021 and IEC 61215-2:2021 requirements for testing. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61215-1-4, issued in 2016. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na. A cyclic (dynamic) mechanical load test (MQT 20)
    added.<br />\r\nb. A test for detection of potential-induced degradation (MQT
    21) added.<br />\r\nc. A bending test (MQT 22) for flexible modules added.<br
    />\r\nThis standard is to be read in conjunction with IEC 61215-1:2021 and IEC
    61215-2:2021."
