abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15415:2004(E) specifies two methodologies for the measurement of
    specific attributes of two-dimensional bar code symbols, one of these being applicable
    to multi-row bar code symbologies and the other to two-dimensional matrix symbologies;
    defines methods for evaluating and grading these measurements and deriving an
    overall assessment of symbol quality; and gives information on possible causes
    of deviation from optimum grades to assist users in taking appropriate corrective
    action.ISO/IEC 15415:2004(E) applies to those two-dimensional symbologies for
    which a reference decode algorithm has been defined, but its methodologies can
    be applied partially or wholly to other similar symbologies.
