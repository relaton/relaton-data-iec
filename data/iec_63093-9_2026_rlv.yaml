abstract:
- content: "IEC 63093-9:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 63093-9:2026
    specifies the shapes and dimensions of ferrite cores for inductive components
    (transformers and chokes), designed to employ coils that are made of multi-layer
    boards, or coils that are part of the motherboard, or flat conductor coils that
    are helically wound. This part also gives the effective parameter values used
    in magnetic calculations for such planar cores. In addition, this document gives
    guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable for planar
    cores. This document is considered as a sectional specification useful in the
    negotiation between ferrite core suppliers and users about surface irregularities.
    The general consideration upon which the design of this range of cores is based
    is given in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) correction
    of some numbers in Table 2;<br />\r\nb) amendment of Table 6 following IEC 60205."
