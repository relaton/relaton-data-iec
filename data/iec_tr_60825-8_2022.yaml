abstract:
- content: IEC 60825:2022, which is a Technical Report, serves as a guide to the employer,
    the responsible person, the laser safety officer, the laser user and other persons
    involved, on the safe use of lasers and laser equipment classified as laser class
    1C, 3B or 4 in interventional applications of laser beams on humans, excluding
    use of consumer products. This document explains the control measures recommended
    for the safety of the laser user, patients, clients, staff, maintenance personnel
    and others. Engineering controls which form part of the laser equipment or the
    installation are also briefly described to provide an understanding of the general
    principles of protection.
