abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14478 specifies techniques for supporting interactive Single,
    and multiple media applications which recognize and emphasize the interrelationships
    among user interfaces, multimedia applications, and multimedia information interchange.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    14478 defines a flexible environment to encompass modular functionality and is
    extensible through the creation of future components, both within and outside
    of Standards committees. It supports a wide range of multimedia applications in
    a consistent way, from simple drawings up to full motion Video, Sound, and virtual
    reality environments.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14478 is independent of any particular implementation
    language, development environment, or execution environment. For integration into
    a programming environment, the Standard shall be embedded in a System dependent
    interface following the particular conventions of that environment. ISO/IEC 14478
    provides versatile packaging techniques beyond the capabilities of monolithic
    Single-media Systems. This allows rearranging and extending functionality to satisfy
    requirements specific to particular application areas. ISO/IEC 14478 is developed
    incrementally with Parts 1 through 4 initially available. Other components are
    expected to be standardized by ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC24 or other subcommittees.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    14478 provides a framework within which application-defined ways of interacting
    with the environment tan be integrated. Methods for the definition, presentation,
    and manipulation of both input and output objects are described. Applicationsupplied
    structuring of objects is also allowed and tan, for example, be used as a basis
    for the development of toolkits for the creation of, presentation of, and interaction
    with multimedia and hyper-media documents and product model data.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    14478 is able to support construction, presentation, and interaction with multiple
    simultaneous inputs and Outputs using multiple media. Several such activities
    may occur simultaneously, and the application program tan adapt its behaviour
    to make best use of the capabilities of its environment.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14478 includes
    interfaces for external storage, retrieval and interchange of multimedia objects.</p>"
