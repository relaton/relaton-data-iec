abstract:
- content: "IEC 61747-3:2015(E) applies to liquid crystal cells of the segment type
    monochrome. It gives details of the quality assessment procedures, inspection
    requirements, screening sequences, sampling requirements and test and measurement
    procedures required for the assessment of liquid crystal display cells. Instead
    of the qualification approval procedure, the capability approval procedure can
    be applied for all products manufactured in a defined process. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) All the references to IECQ and QC were removed in accordance with ISO/IEC
    Directives Part 2, 6.7.1 and 6.7.2;<br />\r\nb) Updated normative references.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 61747-1-1:2014."
