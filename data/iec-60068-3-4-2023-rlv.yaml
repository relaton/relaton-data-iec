  content: "IEC 60068-3-4:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60068-3-4:2023
    provides the necessary information and the basic principles of the effect of humidity
    in the context of environmental testing to assist in preparing relevant specifications,
    such as standards for components or equipment. Furthermore, information is provided
    on operating climatic test chambers. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2001. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the requirements for distilled and deionized
    water have been revised;<br />\r\nb) recommendations for the cleaning procedure
    of test chambers have been included;<br />\r\nc) humidification systems (ultrasonic
    humidifiers and atomizers) have been added;<br />\r\nd) the description of water
    penetration mechanisms has been refined."
