  content: "IEC 61215-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61215-1:2021 lays down
    requirements for the design qualification of terrestrial photovoltaic modules
    suitable for long-term operation in open-air climates. The useful service life
    of modules so qualified will depend on their design, their environment and the
    conditions under which they are operated. Test results are not construed as a
    quantitative prediction of module lifetime. This document is intended to apply
    to all terrestrial flat plate module materials such as crystalline silicon module
    types as well as thin-film modules. It does not apply to systems that are not
    long-term applications, such as flexible modules installed in awnings or tenting.
    This second edition of IEC 61215-1 cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC
    61215-1, published in 2016. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. Addition of a test taken
    from IEC TS 62782.<br />\r\nb. Addition of a test taken from IEC TS 62804-1.<br
    />\r\nc. Addition of test methods required for flexible modules. This includes
    the addition of the bending test (MQT 22).<br />\r\nd. Addition of definitions,
    references and instructions on how to perform the IEC 61215 design qualification
    and type approval on bifacial PV modules.<br />\r\ne. Clarification of the requirements
    related to power output measurements.<br />\r\nf. Addition of weights to junction
    box during 200 thermal cycles.<br />\r\ng. Requirement that retesting be performed
    according to IEC TS 62915.<br />\r\nh. Removal of the nominal module operating
    test (NMOT), and associated test of performance at NMOT, from the IEC 61215 series.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of May 2021 have been included in this copy.</p>"
