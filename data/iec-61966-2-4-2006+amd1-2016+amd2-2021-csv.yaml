  content: IEC 61966-2-4:2006+A1:2016+A2:2016 is applicable to the encoding and communication
    of YCC colours used in video systems and similar applications by defining encoding
    transformations for use in defined reference capturing conditions. If actual conditions
    differ from the reference conditions, additional rendering transformations may
    be required. Such additional rendering transformations are beyond the scope of
    this standard. This bilingual version (2013-02) corresponds to the monolingual
    English version, published in 2006-01.
