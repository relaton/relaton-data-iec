abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24730 defines two air interface protocols and a single application
    program interface (API) for real-time locating systems (RTLS) for use in asset
    management and is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage interoperability
    of products for the growing RTLS market.ISO/IEC 24730-2:2006, the 2,4 GHz air
    interface protocol, establishes a technical standard for real-time locating systems
    that operate at an internationally available 2,4 GHz frequency band and that are
    intended to provide approximate location with frequent updates (for example, several
    times a minute). In order to be compliant with this standard, compliance with
    ISO/IEC 24730-2:2006 and ISO/IEC 24730-1 is required.Real time locating systems
    are wireless systems with the ability to locate the position of an item anywhere
    in a defined space (local/campus, wide area/regional, global) at a point in time
    that is, or is close to, real time. Position is derived by measurements of the
    physical properties of the radio link.ISO/IEC 24730-2:2006 specifies the air interface
    for a system that locates an asset in a controlled area, e.g. warehouse, campus,
    airport (area of interest is instrumented) - accuracy to 3 m.There are a further
    two methods of locating an object which are really RFID rather than RTLS:Locating
    an asset by virtue of the fact that the asset has passed point A at a certain
    time and has not passed point B.Locating an asset by virtue of providing a homing
    beacon whereby a person with a handheld can find an asset.The method of location
    is through identification and location, generally through multi-lateration. The
    different types areTime of Flight Ranging Systems,Amplitude Triangulation,Time
    Difference of Arrival (TDOA),Angle of Arrival.ISO/IEC 24730-2:2006 defines the
    air interface protocol needed for the creation of an RTLS system. There are many
    types of location algorithms that could be used. An example of a location algorithm
    is given in Annex A.ISO/IEC 24730-2:2006 defines a networked location system that
    provides X-Y coordinates and data telemetry. The system utilizes RTLS transmitters
    that autonomously generate a direct-sequence spread spectrum radio frequency beacon.
    These devices may be field programmable and support an optional exciter mode that
    allows modification of the rate of location update and location of the RTLS device.
    ISO/IEC 24730 also defines these modes, but does not define the means by which
    they are accomplished.
