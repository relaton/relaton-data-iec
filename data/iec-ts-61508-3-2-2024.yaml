  content: IEC TS 61508-3-2:2024 covers the general assurance of dependable software
    used in critical operational-technology (OT) which is running on hardware devices
    which are specified as part of the OT application. It is particularly aimed at
    safety-related software which is being developed according to the E/E/PE software
    functional safety standard IEC 61508-3; in particular, the development of the
    software follows a Formal Safety Requirements Specification. Successful use of
    some or all of the assurance points specified in this document enhances the confidence
    that a particular piece of safety-related software meets the requirements of the
    SIL of the safety function which it (partially or fully) implements, and thereby
    increases the systematic capability of the software.
