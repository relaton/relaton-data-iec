  content: "IEC 61315:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61315:2019
    is applicable to instruments measuring radiant power emitted from sources that
    are typical for the fibre-optic communications industry. These sources include
    laser diodes, light emitting diodes (LEDs) and fibre-type sources. Both divergent
    and collimated radiations are covered. This document defines the calibration of
    power meters to be performed by calibration laboratories or by power meter manufacturers.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2005.
    It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update of
    terms and definitions;<br />\r\nb) update of 5.1, including Table 1 (new type
    of source);<br />\r\nc) update of Annex A;<br />\r\nd) addition of Annex B on
    dB conversion.<br />\r\nKeywords: Fibre-optic power meters"
