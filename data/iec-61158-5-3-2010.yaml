  content: IEC 61158-5-3:2010(E) defines in an abstract way the externally visible
    service provided by Type 3 fieldbus Applicatio Layer in terms of an abstract model
    for defining application resources (objects) capable of being manipulated by users
    via the use of the FAL service, the primitive actions and events of the service;
    the parameters associated with each primitive action and event, and the form which
    they take; and the interrelationship between these actions and events, and their
    valid sequences. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2007 and constitutes a technical revision. The main change with respect to
    the previous edition is the correction in 6.2.3.2.3.2 (referencing the error-codes
    in IEC 61158-6-3, 5.3.17 to maintain the codes only in one place).
