  content: "IEC 60269-2:2013+AMD1:2016+AMD2:2024 CSV provides supplementary requirements
    for fuses for use by authorized persons and are generally designed to be used
    in installations where the fuse-links are accessible to, and may be replaced by,
    authorized persons only. Fuses for use by authorized persons according to the
    following fuse systems also comply with the requirements of the corresponding
    subclauses of IEC 60269-1, unless otherwise defined in this standard. This standard
    is divided into fuse systems, each dealing with a specific example of standardized
    fuses for use by authorized persons:<br />\r\n- Fuse system A: Fuses with fuse-links
    with blade contacts (NH fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system B: Fuses with striker
    fuse-links with blade contacts (NH fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system C: Fuse-rails
    (NH fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system D: Fuse-bases for busbar mounting (NH
    fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system E: Fuses with fuse-links for bolted connections
    (BS bolted fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system F: Fuses with fuse-links having
    cylindrical contact caps (NF cylindrical fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system
    G: Fuses with fuse-links with offset blade contacts (BS clip-in fuse system),<br
    />\r\n- Fuse system H: Fuses with fuse-links having \"gD\" and \"gN\" characteristic
    (class J and class time delay and non time delay fuse types),<br />\r\n- Fuse
    system I: gU fuse-links with wedge tightening contacts,<br />\r\n- Fuse system
    J: Fuses with fuse-links having \"gD class CC\" and \"gN class CC\" characteristics
    (class CC time delay and non-time delay fuse types),<br />\r\n- Fuse system K:
    gK fuse-links with blade for bolted connections - High fuse-link ratings from
    1 250 A up to 4 800 A (master fuse-links).<br />\r\nThis fifth edition of IEC
    60269-2 cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2010. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n1. fuse systems
    A and B: modified values for the power dissipation of NH aM fuse-links;<br />\r\n2.
    fuse systems A and B: introduction of dimension r for NH fuse-links;<br />\r\n3.
    addition of new fuse system K: gK fuse-links with contacts for bolted connections.<br
    />\r\nKey Words: fuse systems A to K, requirements for fuses<br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/1232\">IEC
    60269-1:2006</a>.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-06) has been
    included in this copy."
