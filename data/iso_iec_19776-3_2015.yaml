abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19776-3:2015, Extensible 3D (X3D), defines a system that integrates 3D graphics
    and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space that contains
    graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of
    mechanisms. This part of ISO/IEC 19776 defines a mapping of the abstract objects
    in X3D to a specific X3D encoding written out in a compact binary form.<br />\r\nEach
    X3D file encoded using the Compressed binary encoding:<br />\r\na. supports all
    of the purposes of X3D files defined in the X3D abstract specification ISO/IEC
    19775;<br />\r\nb. encodes X3D constructs in a compressed binary format, taking
    advantage of geometric and information-theoretic compression techniques.<br />\r\nX3D
    files encoded using the Compressed binary encoding may be referenced from files
    using other X3D encodings, and may itself reference other X3D files encoded using
    other X3D encodings. Sets of X3D files that use multiple encodings can only be
    processed by browsers that support all of the utilized X3D encodings."
