abstract:
- content: "The Linux Standard Base (LSB) defines a system interface for compiled
    applications and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts. Its
    purpose is to enable a uniform industry standard environment for high-volume applications
    conforming to the LSB.<br /><br />\r\nThese specifications are composed of two
    basic parts: A common specification (\"LSB-generic\" or \"generic LSB\"), ISO/IEC
    23360-1:2006, describing those parts of the interface that remain constant across
    all implementations of the LSB, and an architecture-specific part (\"LSB-arch\"
    or \"archLSB\") describing the parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture.
    Together, the LSB-generic and the relevant architecture-specific parts of ISO/IEC
    23360 for a single hardware architecture provide a complete interface specification
    for compiled application programs on systems that share a common hardware architecture.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 23360-1:2006, the LSB-generic document, is used in conjunction
    with an architecture-specific part. Whenever a section of the LSB-generic specification
    is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the LSB-generic document
    includes a reference to the architecture part."
