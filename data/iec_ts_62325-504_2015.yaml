abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62325-504:2015(E) defines the services needed to support the electronic
    data interchanges between different actors on the European Energy Market for Electricity
    (EME) in a fast (near-real-time), and secure way. At the same time, this Technical
    Specification can also be applied to integration problems outside the scope of
    IEC 62325-451, such as to the integration of gas market systems or general enterprise
    integration. Web Services (in WSDL) will be specified for the defined services,
    applying the Basic Web Service Pattern implementation profile from IEC 61968-100.
    The services needed to support the electronic data interchange on the European
    Energy Market for Electricity are:<br />\r\n- List Messages;<br />\r\n- Get Message;<br
    />\r\n- Put Message."
