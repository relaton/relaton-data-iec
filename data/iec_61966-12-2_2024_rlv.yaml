abstract:
- content: "IEC 61966-12-2:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61966-12-2:2024
    specifies the colour gamut metadata format for video systems intended for use
    in CE (consumer electronics) devices. The metadata specified in this part of IEC
    61966-12 is limited to the gamut description for display types comprising the
    three primary additive colours, whose white and black points have the same chromaticity.
    It is fundamentally based on the conventional VESA-EDID format.<br />\r\nWhen
    associated with content, the simple metadata format defines the gamut for which
    the content was created. It can be used by the display for controlled colour reproduction
    even if the displayâ€™s colour gamut is different from that of the content. When
    associated with a display, the simple metadata format defines the display colour
    gamut. It can be used during content creation to enable improved colour reproduction.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides the simplest, but unambiguous solution for typical
    CE devices that are based on colour gamut information communication.<br />\r\nIEC
    61966-12-2:2024 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the number of bits of metadata format has been extended in Clause 4;<br />\r\nb)
    Annex C has been added for handling HDR content."
