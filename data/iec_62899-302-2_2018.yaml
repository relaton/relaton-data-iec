abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-302-2:2018(E) specifies the method for determining accurate inkjet
    droplet volume based on images obtained by drop-in-flight measurement systems.
    It does not apply to imaging systems using interference fringes, such as holography
    or phase doppler anemometry. This document is not limited to drop-on-demand inkjet
    systems, but might not be applicable to continuous inkjet or liquid dispensing
    systems. This document includes a description of the issues concerning such measurements
    and consideration of the limits to measurement accuracy.
