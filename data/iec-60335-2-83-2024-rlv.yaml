  content: "IEC 60335-2-83:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-83:2024
    deals with the safety of electrically heated gullies for de-icing the inlet of
    the drainage system of flat roofs, balconies, and similar structures, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances. As far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by appliances which are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home.<br />\r\nHowever, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions
    prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour
    or gas).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2001 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    removal of test probe 18 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is
    to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
