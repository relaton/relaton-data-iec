  content: "IEC 62899-401:2025 provides an overview of the IEC 62899-4XX series and
    explains its modular structure. The IEC 62899-4XX series establishes requirements
    for the printability of printed electronics. These requirements are stated as
    measurement of quality, reproducibility, analysis and compliance test methods,
    as well as measuring methods for environmental conditions. The IEC 62899-4XX series
    specifies the measurements and the requirements of both the quality and the reproducibility
    of printed patterns as the result of the interaction of printing plate, ink, substrate,
    and environmental condition. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The published IEC 62899-4XX
    documents are listed in the Bibliography.<br />\r\nb) The definitions of printed
    electronics, printed pattern, and void are modified.<br />\r\nc) The term printing
    media is specified as printing plate.<br />\r\nd) The term pattern width is specified
    as line pattern width.<br />\r\ne) The term thickness is specified as thickness
    of printed line.<br />\r\nf) The definition of basic pattern is modified.<br />\r\ng)
    The structure of IEC 62899-4XX series is updated according to the present projected
    documents numbering."
