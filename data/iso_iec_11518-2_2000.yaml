abstract:
- content: 'This standard defines the data framing for an efficient simplex high-performance
    point-to-point interface. Characteristics of HIPPI-FP include: - large block data
    transfers with framing to split the data into smaller bursts; - separation of
    user control and data information, and early delivery of the control information;
    - identifiers for multiple upper-layer protocols (ULPs); - support for simplex
    topology; - support for ULP non-word-aligned and an arbitrary number of byte transfers;
    - error notifications, from the underlying physical layer, e.g., HIPPI-PH, are
    passed through this framing protocol to notify the upper layers of damaged data;
    - provides a connection-less data service; - best effort delivery of data, i.e.,
    datagram; - connection control information, which may be used for physical layer
    switching, is supported. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 11518 provides data framing
    for a high-performance point-to-point interface between data-processing equipment.
    The purpose is to facilitate the development and use of the HIPPI in computer
    systems by providing common data framing. It provides an efficient framing protocol
    for interconnections between computers, high-performance display systems, and
    high-performance, intelligent block-transfer peripherals.'
