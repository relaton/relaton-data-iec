  content: "IEC 60567:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60567:2023 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60567:2011
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 10 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60567:2023 deals with the techniques for sampling free gases
    from gas-collecting relays from power transformers. Three methods of sampling
    free gases are described. The techniques for sampling oil from oil-filled equipment
    such as power and instrument transformers, reactors, bushings, oil-filled cables
    and oil-filled tank-type capacitors are no longer covered by this document, but
    are instead described in IEC 60475:2022, 4.2. Before analysing the gases dissolved
    in oil, they are first extracted from the oil. Three basic methods are described,
    one using extraction by vacuum (Toepler and partial degassing), another by displacement
    of the dissolved gases by bubbling the carrier gas through the oil sample (stripping)
    and the last one by partition of gases between the oil sample and a small volume
    of the carrier gas (headspace). The gases are analysed quantitatively after extraction
    by gas chromatography; a method of analysis is described. Free gases from gas-collecting
    relays are analysed without preliminary treatment."
