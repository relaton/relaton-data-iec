abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-25:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60317-25:2020
    specifies the requirements of enamelled round aluminium winding wires of class
    200 with a dual coating. The underlying coating is based on polyester or polyesterimide
    resin, which can be modified provided it retains the chemical identity of the
    original resin and meets all specified wire requirements. The superimposed coating
    is based on polyamide-imide resin.<br />\r\nNOTE A modified resin is a resin that
    has undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives to enhance
    certain performance or application characteristics.<br />\r\nThe range of nominal
    conductor diameters covered by this document is:<br />\r\n- Grade 1: 0,250 mm
    up to and including 3,150 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2: 0,250 mm up to and including
    5,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe nominal conductor diameters are specified in Clause 4 of
    IEC 60317-0-3:2008 and IEC 60317-0-3:2008/AMD1:2013. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- new 3.2.2 containing general notes
    on winding wire, formerly a part of the Scope;<br />\r\n- revision to Clause 11
    to take into account intermediate nominal conductor diameters;<br />\r\n- revision
    to Clause 7 to indicate that the springiness test is inappropriate.<br />\r\n-
    revision to Clause 16 to specify only the percentage of extractable matter and
    the minimum retained dielectric breakdown voltage."
