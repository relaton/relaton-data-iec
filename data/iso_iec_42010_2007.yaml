abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 42010:2007 addresses the activities of the creation, analysis and
    sustainment of architectures of software-intensive systems, and the recording
    of such architectures in terms of architectural descriptions. ISO/IEC 42010:2007
    establishes a conceptual framework for architectural description and defines the
    content of an architectural description. Annexes provide the rationale for key
    concepts and terminology, the relationships to other standards, and examples of
    usage.
