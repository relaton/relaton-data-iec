abstract:
- content: IEC&#x2F;TR 62544:2011(E) gives general guidance on the subject of active
    filters for use in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission. It describes
    systems where active devices are used primarily to achieve a reduction in harmonics
    in the d.c. or a.c. systems. This excludes the use of automatically retuned components.
    The various types of circuit that can be used for active filters are described
    in the report, along with their principal operational characteristics and typical
    applications. The overall aim is to provide guidance for purchasers to assist
    with the task of specifying active filters as part of HVDC converters. Passive
    filters are specifically excluded from this report.
