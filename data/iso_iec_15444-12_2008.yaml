    is a general format forming the basis for a number of other more specific file
    formats. This format contains the timing, structure, and media information for
    timed sequences of media data, such as audio/visual presentations.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15444-12:2008 is applicable to JPEG 2000, but its technical content is identical
    to that of ISO/IEC 14496-12:2008, which is applicable to MPEG-4.</p>"
