    <p>ISO 18584:2015 establishes</p>
    <p>-      conformance test requirements for using general framework for on-card comparison applications,</p>
    <p>-      conformance test requirements for using work-sharing mechanism for on-card comparison applications, and</p>
    <p>-      conformance test requirements to check accomplishment of security policies for on-card biometric comparison that are specified in ISO/IEC 24787:2010.</p>
    <p>ISO 18584:2015 only covers the testing of APDU command and response pairs involved for the ICC that has the capability to perform on-card biometric comparison based on ISO/IEC 24787:2010.</p>
    <p>Measuring the performance of on-card biometric comparison algorithms in terms of error rates is not within the scope of this International Standard.</p>
