abstract:
- content: "<p>This document introduces security properties and provides best practices
    on the test and evaluation of white box cryptography (WBC). WBC is a cryptographic
    algorithm specialized for a key or secret, but where the said key cannot be extracted.</p><p>The
    WBC implementation can consist of plain source code for the cryptographic algorithm
    and/or of a device implementing the algorithm. In both cases, security functions
    are implemented to deter an attacker from uncovering the key or secret.</p><p>Security
    properties consist in the secrecy of security parameters concealed within the
    implementation of the white box cryptography. Best practices for the test and
    evaluation includes mathematical and practical analyses, static and dynamic analyses,
    non-invasive and invasive analyses.</p><p>This document is related to ISO/IEC
    19790 which specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules. In those
    modules, critical security parameters (CSPs) and public security parameters (PSPs)
    are the assets to protect. WBC is one solution to conceal CSPs inside of the implementation.</p>"
