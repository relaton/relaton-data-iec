abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29136-3:2009 provides guidance on the mapping of the set of
    user needs with the provisions of a particular standard, technical report, or
    set of guidelines. It provides both basic guidance that should be used for all
    user needs mapping and optional guidance that may be added to the basic guidance.<br
    /><br />\r\nUser needs mapping is a voluntary activity intended to help improve
    accessibility for all users and in particular for users with special needs that
    might otherwise be overlooked. User needs mapping is not intended to be used to
    evaluate, certify, or otherwise judge a given standard or set of guidelines."
