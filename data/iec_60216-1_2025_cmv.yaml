abstract:
- content: "<p>IEC 60216-1:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60216-1:2025 edition 7.0 and the previous 60216-1:2013
    edition 6.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 112 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60216-1:2025 specifies the general ageing conditions and procedures
    to be used for deriving thermal endurance characteristics and gives guidance in
    using the detailed instructions and guidelines in the other parts of IEC 60216.
    Although originally developed for use with electrical insulating materials and
    simple combinations of such materials, the procedures are considered to be of
    more general applicability and are widely used in the assessment of materials
    not intended for use as electrical insulation. In the application of this document,
    it is assumed that a practically linear relationship exists between the logarithm
    of the time required to cause the predetermined property change and the reciprocal
    of the corresponding absolute temperature (Arrhenius relationship). For the valid
    application of this document, no transition, in particular no first-order transition,
    is expected to occur in the temperature range under study.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) the definition for temperature index (TI) has been updated;<br
    />\r\nb) requirements for selection of related materials used, e.g. in different
    colours (5.1.2), have been added;<br />\r\nc) test procedure for thickness sensitivity
    (5.5 et 6.6) has been added;<br />\r\nd) Annex C \"Concepts in earlier editions\"
    has been deleted.</p>"
