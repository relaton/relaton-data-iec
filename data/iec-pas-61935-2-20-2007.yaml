  content: Describes Work area cord for class D applications, as defined in ISO/IEC
    11801 as well as in the ISO/IEC 24702. Should be used in conjunction with IEC
    61156-1 and IEC 61156-6 and IEC 60603-7-2 and 60603-7-3.  The blank detail specification
    determines the layout and style for detail specifications describing symmetrical
    pair/quad cables with transmission characteristics up to 100 MHz for digital communications.
    Detail specifications, based on the blank detail specification, may be prepared
    by a national organization, a manufacturer, or a user.
