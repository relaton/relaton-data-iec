abstract:
- content: This document specifies a general framework for the security evaluation
    of quantum key distribution (QKD) according to the ISO/IEC 15408 series. Specifically,
    it specifies a baseline set of common security functional requirements (SFRs)
    for QKD modules, including SFRs on the conventional network components and the
    quantum optical components, and the entire implementation of QKD protocols. To
    facilitate the analysis of SFRs, security problems that QKD modules can face in
    their operational environment are analysed based on a structural analysis of the
    security functionality of QKD modules and the classification of QKD protocols.
    The SFRs on conventional network components of QKD modules are mainly characterized
    under the framework of the ISO/IEC 15408 series and also refer to the methodology
    of ISO/IEC 19790 and relevant standards on testing of cryptographic modules and
    network devices.
