abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61724-2:2025 applies to grid-connected PV systems comprising at
    least one inverter.<br />\r\nThe test evaluates the PV system only in conditions
    where output is unconstrained by limitations in AC power output from the inverters.
    This document defines a test of a PV system's power performance index (PPI). PPI,
    defined in IEC 61724‑1, is the ratio of a system's measured power output under
    test conditions to its expected output at those conditions based on the system's
    design.<br />\r\nThe test is intended to be performed over a short period of typically
    three to five days and is typically used to satisfy a contractual performance
    guarantee as part of the final completion of a PV power plant. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Adapting the document for bifacial PV systems, in accordance with the
    latest edition of IEC 61724‑1 and current industry practices.<br />\r\nb) Adapting
    the test procedure to account for the limited times of unconstrained system operation
    which are now common because of high DC-to-AC ratios (clipping) and interconnection
    limits (curtailment).<br />\r\nc) Adapting the test procedure to achieve a test
    that can be performed in a short time of three to five days during favourable
    conditions.<br />\r\nd) Focusing the document more heavily on the use of modern
    PV system modelling software to obtain the expected performance of the system
    under test.<br />\r\ne) Simplifying the mathematical procedure for calculating
    the test results.<br />\r\nf) Clearly identifying test elections (optional choices
    to be made in conducting the test) and providing a template for documenting these
    elections.<br />\r\ng) Clarifying the discussion of the test boundary that separates
    tested variables from untested variables.<br />\r\nh) Expanding and clarifying
    the discussion of data filtering."
