  content: "IEC 61196-1-113:2018(E) applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies
    a test method for determining the attenuation constant of coaxial cables for use
    in communications systems. The test is applicable preferably at frequencies ≥
    5 MHz, but also for lower frequencies if the magnitude of the complex characteristic
    impedance is approximately equal to the nominal characteristic impedance of the
    specimen or if a form fitting function is applied.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: diverse form fitting equations
    are provided."
