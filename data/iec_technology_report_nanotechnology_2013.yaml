abstract:
- content: "Nanotechnology brings significant benefits to energy storage and the overall
    solar energy sector for example in terms of improved materialsâ€™ efficiency and
    reduced manufacturing costs. Concretely, battery storage capacity could be increased,
    solar cells could be produced cheaper and their lifetime extended.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    Technology Report outlines a whole range of nanomaterials and nanotechnologies,
    evaluating their role in addressing the energy challenge. Notably, it discusses
    their potential contribution to the successful integration of renewable energy
    and energy storage.<br /><br />\r\nThe publication is intended for manufacturers
    of products for energy generation and storage as well as for energy regulators.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis Technology Report was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board
    (MSB) together with the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research
    ISI.<br /><br />\r\nThis Technology Report is available for free download."
