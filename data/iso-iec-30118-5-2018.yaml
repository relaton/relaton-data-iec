    <p>The OCF Smart Home Device specification is an Application Profile specification. </p>
    <p>The Smart Home Device specification specifies the Smart Home devices. The Smart Home Device definitions use Resource definitions from the OCF Resource Type Specification. </p>
    <p>The Smart Home Device Specification is built on top of the Core Specification. The Core Specification specifies the core architecture, interfaces protocols and services to enable the implementation of profiles for IoT usages and ecosystems. The Core specification also defines the main architectural components of network connectivity, discovery, data transmission, device &amp; service management and ID &amp; security.  The core architecture is scalable to support simple devices (constrained devices) and more capable devices (smart devices).</p>
