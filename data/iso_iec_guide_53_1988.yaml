abstract:
- content: 'This Guide outlines a general approach by which certification bodies wishing
    to do so can develop and apply product certification programmes utilizing elements
    of suppliers'' quality systems. The forms of programmes chosen by this guide are
    for conformity certification of products only. The following steps in developing
    a programme are considered: the qualification phase, the certification phase,
    and the follow-up phase. The annexes A and B include examples of a programme data
    form in a case involving very few and many elements of a supplier''s quality system,
    respectively.'
