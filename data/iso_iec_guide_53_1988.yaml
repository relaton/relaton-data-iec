    wishing to do so can develop and apply product certification programmes utilizing
    elements of suppliers' quality systems. The forms of programmes chosen by this
    guide are for conformity certification of products only. The following steps in
    developing a programme are considered: the qualification phase, the certification
    phase, and the follow-up phase. The annexes A and B include examples of a programme
    data form in a case involving very few and many elements of a supplier's quality
    system, respectively.</p>"
