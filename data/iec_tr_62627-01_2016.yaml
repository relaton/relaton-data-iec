abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62627-01:2016(E) which is a Technical Report, details cleaning
    methods for fibre optic connectors. It includes typical cleaning tools and machines,
    and cleaning procedures. Other cleaning methods may exist. The impact of contamination
    and the reasons for connector visual inspection and cleaning are described in
    Annex B. This Technical Report does not address the visual inspection criteria,
    which are covered in IEC 61300-3-35:2015. Optical fibre patch cords are handled
    by the operators and maintenance staff of optical network systems. This Technical
    Report may be used as a guideline to prepare instruction manuals for those involved
    in optical system maintenance and operation. This Technical Report covers fibre
    optic connector plugs, optical adaptors, optical receptacles (excluding optical
    transceivers) and dust caps. Guidelines for optical connector end-face cleaning
    methods for receptacle style optical transceivers are covered in IEC TR 62572-4.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    restructure of clauses;<br />\r\n- addition of some terms and definitions;<br
    />\r\n- addition of information on cleaning tools and machines;<br />\r\n- addition
    of information on dust caps;<br />\r\n- addition of applicable cleaning tools
    and machines for optical connectors.<br />\r\nKeywords: fibre optic connectors,
    optical system maintenance and operation"
