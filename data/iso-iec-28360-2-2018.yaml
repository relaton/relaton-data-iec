    <p>This Standard (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from ICT &amp; CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC).</p>
    <p>This Standard (all parts) includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PC's.</p>
    <p>Part 2 specifies the methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from electronic equipment not using consumables.</p>
    <p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p>
    <p>Examples of EUT that do not use consumables are:</p>
    <p>—          Monitors and TV sets (CRT, Plasma, LCD, Rear projector, Beamer).</p>
    <p>—          Video (VCR, DVD Player/Recorder, Camcorder).</p>
    <p>—          SAT Receiver (Set-Top Box).</p>
    <p>—          Audio units (CD Player/Recorder, Home theatre Systems, Audio Home Systems, Micro-/Mini, Midi Systems, Amplifier, Receiver).</p>
    <p>—          Portable Audio (CD Player, MP 3 Player, Radio recorder, Clock radio, etc.).</p>
    <p>—          Computer (desktop, tower, server), portable computers (Notebooks).</p>
    <p>The emission rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same class.</p>
    <p>Predictions of "real indoor" <i>concentrations</i> from the determined <i>emission</i> <i>rates</i> are outside the scope of this Standard.</p>
