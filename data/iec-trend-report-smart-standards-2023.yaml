  content: "The report emphasizes the need for an evolution in standards to meet market
    expectations in the near future. It notes that the growing complexity of products
    forces manufacturers to use a greater number of standards, which themselves become
    increasingly complex. Businesses needing solutions, believe the answer lies in
    digitalization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSmart Standards are “the key enabler” through
    which the digital transformation of industries and society can be realized.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report urges the IEC and its partners to develop digitally
    enabled standards that are machine-applicable, readable and transferable (Smart).<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIt provides an economic analysis of the value of Smart Standards
    for end users and for the IEC. Three main benefits emerge – better performance,
    lower risk and future value through assurance of income by operating better in
    dynamic markets.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report presents Smart Standards from a
    technical, market and economic perspective. Smart Standards will introduce new
    market-driven, innovative services that nudge standardization organizations toward
    changing into service organizations, providing products based on software operating
    at different levels of digitalization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt concludes with a
    set of considerations for the IEC Community.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC societal
    and technology trend report was developed by the Societal and Technology Trend
    Working Group (STTWG) in the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB). It complements the activities being conducted
    within the Standardization Management Board (SMB) and the Joint IEC/ISO task force.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/smart-standards-market-and-industry-perspective\">free
