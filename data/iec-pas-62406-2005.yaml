  content: specifies the protocol set necessary for RTE-TCnet, specifically of the
    Data Link layer and the Application layer, which is mapped on top of the Data
    Link layer to exploit the services in terms of the "three-layer" Fieldbus Reference
    Model which is based in part on the OSI Basic Reference Model. Both Reference
    Models subdivide the area of standardization for interconnection into a series
    of layers of specification, each of manageable size
