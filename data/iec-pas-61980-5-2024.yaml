  content: "IEC PAS 61980-5:2024 applies to the off-board supply equipment for dynamic
    wireless power transfer via magnetic field (MF-D-WPT) to electric road vehicles
    in motion for purposes of supplying electric energy to the RESS (rechargeable
    energy storage system) and/or other on-board electrical systems.<br />\r\nThe
    system operates at standard supply voltage ratings per IEC 60038 up to 1 000 V
    AC and up to 1 500 V DC from the supply network. The power transfer takes place
    primarily while the electric vehicle (EV) is in motion, but can continue to take
    place under certain conditions while the vehicle is not in motion.<br />\r\nOff-board
    supply equipment fulfilling the requirements in this document are intended to
    operate with EV devices fulfilling the requirements of ISO 5474-4 and ISO 5474-6.<br
    />\r\nThe aspects covered in this document includes<br />\r\n– the characteristics
    and operating conditions,<br />\r\n– specific power transfer requirements for
    the off-board side of magnetic field dynamic wireless power transfer systems for
    electric road vehicles, and<br />\r\n– the general requirement of electrical safety
    and EMC for MF-D-WPT."
