  content: "IEC 61993-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC
    61993-2:2018 specifies the minimum operational and performance requirements, methods
    of testing and required test results conforming to performance standards adopted
    by IMO in Resolution MSC.74(69):1998, Annex 3. This document incorporates the
    applicable technical characteristics of Class A shipborne equipment included in
    Recommendation ITU-R M.1371 and takes into account the ITU Radio Regulations,
    where applicable. In addition, it takes account of IMO Resolution A.694(17) to
    which IEC 60945 is associated. When a requirement in this document is different
    from IEC 60945, the requirement of this document takes precedence. This document
    also specifies the minimum requirements both for the means to input and display
    data and for the interfaces to other equipment suitable to be used as means of
    input and display data. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) it incorporates the technical characteristics included in Recommendation
    ITU R M.1371-5:2014;<br />\r\nb) it introduces the concept of locating device
    groups in order to include EPIRB AIS and MOB AIS in addition to AIS SART;<br />\r\nc)
    it adds security features for configuration input by introducing a new sentence
    SSA;<br />\r\nd) it adds optional implementation of IEC 61162-450/460 interfaces;<br
    />\r\ne) it adds requirements for bridge alert management (BAM);<br />\r\nf) it
    introduces extended dimension values used by towing vessels;<br />\r\ng) it adds
    a software update requirement."
