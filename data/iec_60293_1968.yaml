abstract:
- content: Specifies the standard values and tolerances of a.c. mains supply voltages
    and frequencies, from which the instruments shall be designated to operate, and
    the standard values of nominal stabilized d.c. power supply voltages for d.c.
    supply of instruments by mains-operated stabilized d.c. sources that are not an
    integral part of the instrument to which they supply power.
