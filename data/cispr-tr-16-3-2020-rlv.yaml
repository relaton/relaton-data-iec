  content: "CISPR TR 16-3:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>CISPR 16-3:2020 is a collection
    of technical reports (Clause 4) that serve as background and supporting information
    for the various other standards and technical reports in CISPR 16 series. In addition,
    background information is provided on the history of CISPR, as well as a historical
    reference on the measurement of interference power from household and similar
    appliances in the VHF range (Clause 5). Over the years, CISPR prepared a number
    of recommendations and reports that have significant technical merit but were
    not generally available. Reports and recommendations were for some time published
    in CISPR 7 and CISPR 8. At its meeting in Campinas, Brazil, in 1988, CISPR subcommittee
    A agreed on the table of contents of CISPR 16-3, and to publish the reports for
    posterity by giving the reports a permanent place in CISPR 16-3. With the reorganization
    of CISPR 16 in 2003, the significance of CISPR limits material was moved to CISPR
    16-4-3, whereas recommendations on statistics of disturbance complaints and on
    the report on the determination of limits were moved to CISPR 16‑4-4:2007. The
    contents of Amendment 1 (2002) of CISPR 16-3:2000 were moved to CISPR 16-4-1.
    NOTE As a consolidated collection of independent technical reports, this document
    can contain symbols that have differing meanings from one clause to the next.
    Attempts have been made to minimize this to the extent possible at the time of
    editing. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. The main technical change
    with respect to the previous edition consists of the addition of detailed background
    information on the large loop antenna system (LLAS) and its measurement method
    in general and on the models and equations which apply to calculate the reference
    validation factor and conversion factor curves.</p>"
