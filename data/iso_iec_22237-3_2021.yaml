abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses power supplies to, and power distribution within,
    data centres based upon the criteria and classifications for “availability”, “physical
    security” and “energy efficiency enablement” within ISO/IEC 22237‑1.</p><p>This
    document specifies requirements and recommendations for the following:</p><p>a)
    power supplies to data centres;</p><p>b) power distribution systems to all equipment
    within data centres;</p><p>c) telecommunications infrastructure bonding;</p><p>d)
    lightning protection;</p><p>e) devices for the measurement of the power consumption
    and power quality characteristics at points along the power distribution system
    and their integration within management tools.</p><p>Safety and electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document and are
    covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this
    document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.</p><p>Conformance
    of data centres to the present document is covered in Clause 4.</p><p>The use
    of the data centre stored energy or alternate sources to be used by the grid is
    not in the scope of this document and is for consideration in future specifications.</p>"
