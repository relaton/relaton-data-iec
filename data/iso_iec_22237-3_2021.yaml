abstract:
- content: "This document addresses power supplies to, and power distribution within,
    data centres based upon the criteria and classifications for “availability”, “physical
    security” and “energy efficiency enablement” within ISO/IEC 22237‑1.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies requirements and recommendations for the following:<br />\r\na)
    power supplies to data centres;<br />\r\nb) power distribution systems to all
    equipment within data centres;<br />\r\nc) telecommunications infrastructure bonding;<br
    />\r\nd) lightning protection;<br />\r\ne) devices for the measurement of the
    power consumption and power quality characteristics at points along the power
    distribution system and their integration within management tools.<br />\r\nSafety
    and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of
    this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information
    given in this document can be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.<br
    />\r\nConformance of data centres to the present document is covered in Clause
    4.<br />\r\nThe use of the data centre stored energy or alternate sources to be
    used by the grid is not in the scope of this document and is for consideration
    in future specifications."
