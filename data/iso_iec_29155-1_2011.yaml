abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29155-1:2011 identifies a framework for information technology
    (IT) project performance benchmarking (e.g. development or maintenance productivity)
    and related aspects (e.g. data collection and software classification). The framework
    consists of activities and components that are necessary to successfully identify,
    define, select, apply, and improve benchmarking for IT project performance. It
    also provides definitions for IT project performance benchmarking terms.The target
    audience of ISO/IEC 29155-1:2011 are the stakeholders of IT project performance
    benchmarking. ISO/IEC 29155-1:2011 does not prescribe how to organize benchmarking.
    It is out of the scope of ISO/IEC 29155-1:2011 to prescribe the name, format,
    or explicit content of the documentation to be produced from the benchmarking
    process.
