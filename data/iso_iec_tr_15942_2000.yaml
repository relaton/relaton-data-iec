    TR 15942:2000 This Technical Report provides guidance on the use of Ada when producing
    high integrity systems. In producing such applications it is usually the case
    that adherence to guidelines or standards has to be demonstrated to independent
    bodies.<br />\r\nThese guidelines or standards vary according to the application
    area, industrial sector or nature of the risk involved.<br />\r\nFor safety applications,
    the international generic standard is [IEC 61508] of which part 3 is concerned
    with software.<br />\r\nFor security systems, the multi-national generic assessment
    guide is [ISO CD 15408].<br />\r\nFor sector-specific guidance and standards there
    are:<br />\r\nAirborne civil avionics: [DO-178B]<br />\r\nNuclear power plants:
    [IEC 880]<br />\r\nMedical systems: [IEC 601-4]<br />\r\nPharmaceutical: [GAMP]<br
    />\r\nFor national/regional guidance and standards there are the following:<br
    />\r\nUK Defence: [DS 00-55]<br />\r\nEuropean rail: [EN 50128]<br />\r\nEuropean
    security: [ITSEC]<br />\r\nUS nuclear: [NRC]<br />\r\nUK automotive: [MISRA]<br
    />\r\nUS medical: [FDA]<br />\r\nUS space: [NASA]<br />\r\nThe above standards
    and guides are referred to as Standards in this Technical Report. The above list
    is not exhaustive but indicative of the type of Standard to which this Technical
    Report provides guidance.<br />\r\nThe specific Standards above are not addressed
    individually but this Technical Report is synthesized from an analysis of their
    requirements and recommendations.<br />\r\n1.1 Within the scope<br />\r\nThis
    Technical Report assumes that a system is being developed in Ada to meet a standard
    listed above or one of a similar nature. The primary goal of this Technical Report
    is to translate general requirements into Ada specific ones. For example, a general
    standard might require that dynamic testing provides evidence of the execution
    of all the statements in the code of the application. In the case of generics,
    this is interpreted by this Technical Report to mean all instantiations of the
    generic should be executed.<br />\r\nThis Technical Report is intended to provide
    guidance only, and hence there are no?shalls'. However, this Technical Report
    identifies verification and validation issues which should be resolved and documented
    according to the sector-specific standards being employed.<br />\r\nThe following
    topics are within the scope of this Technical Report:<br />\r\n- the choice of
    features of the language which aid verification and compliance to the standards,<br
    />\r\n- identification of language features requiring additional verification
    steps,<br />\r\n- the use of tools to aid design and verification,<br />\r\n-
    issues concerning qualification of compilers for use on high integrity applications,<br
    />\r\n- tools, such as graphic design tools, which generate Ada source code which
    is accessible to users.<br />\r\nTools which generate Ada source code require
    special consideration. Where generated code may be modified or extended, verification
    of the extensions and overall system will be assisted if the guidelines have been
    taken into account. Even where modification is not planned, inspection and analysis
    of the generated code may be unavoidable unless the generator is trusted or \"qualified\"
    according to an applicable standard. Finally, even if generated code is neither
    modified nor inspected, the overall verification process may be made more complicated
    if the code deviates from guidelines intended to facilitate testing and analysis.
    Potential users of such tools should evaluate their code generation against the
    guidance provided in this Technical Report.<br />\r\n1.2 Out of scope<br />\r\nThe
    following topics are considered to be out of scope with respect to this Technical
    Report:<br />\r\n- Domain-specific standards,<br />\r\n- Application-specific
    issues,<br />\r\n- Hardware and system-specific issues,<br />\r\n- Human factor"
