- content: "<p><strong>1 Scope</strong></p><p>This Technical Report provides guidance
    on the use of Ada when producing high integrity systems. In producing such</p><p>applications
    it is usually the case that adherence to guidelines or standards has to be demonstrated
    to independent bodies.</p><p>These guidelines or standards vary according to the
    application area, industrial sector or nature of the risk involved.</p><p>For
    safety applications, the international generic standard is [IEC 61508] of which
    part 3 is concerned with software.</p><p>For security systems, the multi-national
    generic assessment guide is [ISO CD 15408].</p><p>For sector-specific guidance
    and standards there are:</p><p><strong>Airborne civil avionics</strong>: [DO-178B]</p><p><strong>Nuclear
    power plants</strong>: [IEC 880]</p><p><strong>Medical systems</strong>: [IEC
    601-4]</p><p><strong>Pharmaceutical</strong>: [GAMP]</p><p>For national/regional
    guidance and standards there are the following:</p><p><strong>UK Defence</strong>:
    [DS 00-55]</p><p><strong>European rail</strong>: [EN 50128]</p><p><strong>European
    security</strong>: [ITSEC]</p><p><strong>US nuclear</strong>: [NRC]</p><p><strong>UK
    automotive</strong>: [MISRA]</p><p><strong>US medical</strong>: [FDA]</p><p><strong>US
    space</strong>: [NASA]</p><p>The above standards and guides are referred to as
    Standards in this Technical Report. The above list is not exhaustive but</p><p>indicative
    of the type of Standard to which this Technical Report provides guidance.</p><p>The
    specific Standards above are not addressed individually but this Technical Report
    is synthesized from an analysis of their</p><p>requirements and recommendations.</p><p><strong>1.1
    Within the scope</strong></p><p>This Technical Report assumes that a system is
    being developed in Ada to meet a standard listed above or one of a similar</p><p>nature.
    The primary goal of this Technical Report is to translate general requirements
    into Ada specific ones. For example, a</p><p>general standard might require that
    dynamic testing provides evidence of the execution of all the statements in the
    code of the</p><p>application. In the case of generics, this is interpreted by
    this Technical Report to mean all instantiations of the generic should</p><p>be
    executed.</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC TR 15942:2000 (E)</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong>Â©
    ISO/IEC 2000 - All rights reserved</p><p>This Technical Report is intended to
    provide guidance only, and hence there are no?shalls'. However, this Technical
    Report</p><p>identifies verification and validation issues which should be resolved
    and documented according to the sector-specific</p><p>standards being employed.</p><p>The
    following topics are within the scope of this Technical Report:</p><p>_ the choice
    of features of the language which aid verification and compliance to the standards,</p><p>_
    identification of language features requiring additional verification steps,</p><p>_
    the use of tools to aid design and verification,</p><p>_ issues concerning qualification
    of compilers for use on high integrity applications,</p><p>_ tools, such as graphic
    design tools, which generate Ada source code which is accessible to users.</p><p>Tools
    which generate Ada source code require special consideration. Where generated
    code may be modified or extended,</p><p>verification of the extensions and overall
    system will be assisted if the guidelines have been taken into account. Even where</p><p>modification
    is not planned, inspection and analysis of the generated code may be unavoidable
    unless the generator is trusted or</p><p>?qualified' according to an applicable
    standard. Finally, even if generated code is neither modified nor inspected, the
    overall</p><p>verification process may be made more complicated if the code deviates
    from guidelines intended to facilitate testing and</p><p>analysis. Potential users
    of such tools should evaluate their code generation against the guidance provided
    in this Technical</p><p>Report.</p><p><strong>1.2 Out of scope</strong></p><p>The
    following topics are considered to be out of scope with respect to this Technical
    Report:</p><p>_ Domain-specific standards,</p><p>_ Application-specific issues,</p><p>_
    Hardware and system-specific issues,</p><p>_ Human factor</p>"
