abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15944-21:2023 This document specifies the business operational
    view of an implementation of an Open-edi Distributed Business Transaction Repository
    (OeDBTR), building on the principles and concepts defined in ISO/IEC 15944-4 of
    a business transaction. The repository stores the history of the transitions in
    states of the economic claim and/or other business entities that happen over the
    course of a business transaction, and does so for a collection of business events.
    These business events, comprised of transactions and their states, can be identified
    unambiguously so as to provide the ability to inspect or query the information
    at some point after the record has been made. The distributed nature of the repository
    offers users ubiquitous and robust access to the recorded history.<br />\r\nA
    history of business transactions of market exchanges can be useful in auditing
    or other memoing-based activities, looking back at the immutable record of the
    interactions between parties.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify the Functional
    Services View of a particular implementation of an Open-edi Distributed Business
    Transaction Repository. For best performance, candidate technologies would likely
    exhibit properties of long-term permanence, robust immutability, decentralized
    access, distributed resilience, and fine-grained addressability."
