    CISPR 18-2:2010(E), which is a technical report, applies to radio noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment which may cause interference to radio reception. The frequency range covered is 0,15 MHz to 300 MHz. A general procedure for establishing the limits of the radio noise field from the power lines and equipment is recommended, together with typical values as examples, and methods of measurement. The clause on limits concentrates on the low frequency and medium frequency bands and it is only in these bands where ample evidence, based on established practice, is available. No examples of limits to protect radio reception in the frequency band 30 MHz to 300 MHz have been given, as measuring methods and certain other aspects of the problems in this band have not yet been fully resolved. Site measurements and service experience have shown that levels of noise from power lines at frequencies higher than 300 MHz are so low that interference is unlikely to be caused to television reception. The values of limits given as examples are calculated to provide a reasonable degree of protection to the reception of broadcasting at the boundary of the recognized service areas of the appropriate transmitters in the radio frequency bands used for a.m. broadcasting, in the least favourable conditions likely to be generally encountered. These limits are intended to provide guidance at the planning stage of the line and national standards or other specifications against which the performance of the line may be checked after construction and during its useful life. The measuring apparatus and methods used for checking compliance with limits should comply with the respective CISPR specifications, as e.g. the basic standards series CISPR 16. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1986. It is a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    - while the first edition of CISPR 18-2 only considered the direct distance D0 for the establishment of standard profiles for the lateral radio noise field emanating from HV overhead power lines,<br />
    - this second edition now also allows for use of the lateral distance y0 for these purposes. This way it allows for conduction of on-site measurements and simplified recording and use of measurement data obtained at lateral distances y slant to the pathway of modern HV and UHV overhead power line constructions with tall suspension towers.
