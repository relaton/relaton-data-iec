  content: "Energy is central to nearly every major challenge and opportunity the
    world faces. However, one fifth of the world population still lacks access to
    energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe interconnection of grids would open up an unprecedented
    opportunity to globally share the resources of the whole planet, bringing clean
    energy to everybody, everywhere in the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGlobal energy
    interconnection (GEI) is technically highly complex. It will require a level of
    dependability never seen before. International Standards inherently contain solutions
    that will help pre-address this complexity and they will play a crucial role in
    mastering dependability upfront.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper aims to assess
    the worldwide needs, benefits, policies and preconditions for GEI. It examines
    the readiness of potential markets and identifies technical and business trends
    as well as hurdles. It analyzes and compares several global transmission scenarios
    and evaluates their impact on energy supply, the environment, technologies, policies
    as well as standards development, providing recommendations to all stakeholders.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board
    (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>) Global Energy Interconnection project
    team with major contributions from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and State
    Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available
    for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/global-energy-interconnection\">free
