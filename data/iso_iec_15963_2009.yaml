abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15963:2009 describes numbering systems that are available for
    the identification of RF tags.<br /><br />\r\nThe unique ID can be used<br />\r\n\tfor
    the traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in its manufacturing
    process,<br />\r\n\tfor the traceability of the RF tag during its manufacturing
    process and along its lifetime,<br />\r\n\tfor the completion of the reading in
    a multi-antenna configuration,<br />\r\n\tby the anti-collision mechanism to inventory
    multiple tags in the reader's field of view, and<br />\r\n\tfor the traceability
    of the Item to which the RF tag is attached.<br /><br /><br />"
