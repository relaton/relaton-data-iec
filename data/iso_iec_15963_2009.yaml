    the identification of RF tags.</p><p>The unique ID can be used</p><ul><li>for
    the traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in its manufacturing
    process,</li><li>for the traceability of the RF tag during its manufacturing process
    and along its lifetime,</li><li>for the completion of the reading in a multi-antenna
    configuration,</li><li>by the anti-collision mechanism to inventory multiple tags
    in the reader's field of view, and</li><li>for the traceability of the Item to
    which the RF tag is attached.</li></ul>"
