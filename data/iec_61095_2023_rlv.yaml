abstract:
- content: "IEC 61095:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61095:2023
    applies to electromechanical air break contactors for household and similar purposes
    provided with main contacts intended to be connected to circuits the rated voltage
    of which does not exceed 440 V AC (between phases) with rated operational currents
    less than or equal to 63 A for utilization category AC-7a, and 32 A for utilization
    categories AC‑7b, AC‑7c and AC-7d (expressed in rated power), and rated conditional
    short-circuit current less than or equal to 6 kA. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of requirements for screwless
    terminals;<br />\r\nb) addition of requirements for the switching of LED lamps.
    Contactors for domestic and similar applications can be used for controlling lighting
    loads which is increasingly using LED lamp technology. A specific category for
    contactors is created: AC-7d. Requirements and tests are added to cover this market
    development, mainly for making and breaking and conventional operational performance;<br
    />\r\nc) addition of requirements for contactors with electronically controlled
    electromagnet. Household contactors with electronically controlled electromagnet
    are available for years on the market. To fully cover such device, requirements
    and tests are added, dealing mainly with operating limits, behaviour in abnormal
    conditions, breakdown of components, EMC tests, etc.<br />\r\nd) embedded software.
    More and more contactors are incorporating electronic circuits with embedded software.
    A reference is provided to guide the design of the software."
