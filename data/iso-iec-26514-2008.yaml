  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 26514:2008 provides requirements for the design and development
    of software user documentation as part of the life cycle processes. It defines
    the documentation process from the viewpoint of the documentation developer. ISO/IEC
    26514:2008 also covers the documentation product. It specifies the structure,
    content, and format for user documentation, and also provides informative guidance
    for user documentation style. It is independent of the software tools that may
    be used to produce documentation, and applies to both printed documentation and
    on-screen documentation. Much of ISO/IEC 26514:2008 is also applicable to user
    documentation for systems including hardware.</p>"
