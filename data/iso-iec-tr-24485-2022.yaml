    <p>This document introduces security properties and provides best practices on the test and evaluation of white box cryptography (WBC). WBC is a cryptographic algorithm specialized for a key or secret, but where the said key cannot be extracted.</p>
    <p>The WBC implementation can consist of plain source code for the cryptographic algorithm and/or of a device implementing the algorithm. In both cases, security functions are implemented to deter an attacker from uncovering the key or secret.</p>
    <p>Security properties consist in the secrecy of security parameters concealed within the implementation of the white box cryptography. Best practices for the test and evaluation includes mathematical and practical analyses, static and dynamic analyses, non-invasive and invasive analyses.</p>
    <p>This document is related to ISO/IEC 19790 which specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules. In those modules, critical security parameters (CSPs) and public security parameters (PSPs) are the assets to protect. WBC is one solution to conceal CSPs inside of the implementation.</p>
