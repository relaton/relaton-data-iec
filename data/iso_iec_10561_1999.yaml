abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies a method for measuring the throughput
    of class 1 and class 2 printers, as</p><p>defined in ISO/IEC 11160-1. This International
    Standard specifies three different test patterns:</p><p>· a standard business
    letter;</p><p>· a spreadsheet;</p><p>· a graphic pattern.</p><p>In addition, this
    International Standard defines a method for a performance test and one for an
    endurance test.</p><p>These tests are intended to measure only the printer throughput
    for documents in the same class as the test</p><p>patterns and not to evaluate
    any other printer features such as character shaping, print compressions,</p><p>network/controller
    performance, colour, etc. The method is relevant to class 1 and class 2 printer
    types (e.g. dot</p><p>matrix, daisy wheel, ink jet, thermal transfer printers)
    and to all configurations (e.g. tractor feed, cut sheet feed,</p><p>80-column
    and over 132-column print width, etc.). It is not the most suitable for comparing
    performance of other</p><p>classes of printing devices such as high-speed page-oriented
    printers or color printers.</p><p>This method is intended for use by printer manufacturers
    and test houses so that a common form of test result</p><p>presentation shall
    be obtained. It will also enable a user to make a quick and easy comparison of
    the printing</p><p>throughput of different printers.</p>"
