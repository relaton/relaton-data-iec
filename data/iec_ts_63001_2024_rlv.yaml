abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63001:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 63001:2024
    provides a technique of measurement and evaluation of ultrasound in liquids for
    use in cleaning devices, equipment, and ultrasonic reactors. It specifies<br />\r\n-
    the cavitation measurement at frequencies between harmonics of the operating frequency
    f0,<br />\r\n- the cavitation measurement derived by integrating broadband cavitation
    noise energy,<br />\r\n- the cavitation measurement by extraction of broadband
    spectral components.<br />\r\nThis document covers the measurement and evaluation
    of cavitation, but not its secondary effects (cleaning results, sonochemical effects,
    etc.). Further details regarding the generation of cavitation noise in ultrasonic
    baths and ultrasonic reactors are provided in Annex A.<br />\r\nIEC TS 63001:2024
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of
    a new method of measurement: the measurement of integrated broadband cavitation
    energy between two frequency bounds."
