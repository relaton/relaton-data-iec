abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 21823-4:2022 specifies the IoT interoperability from a syntactic
    point of view. In ISO&#x2F;IEC 21823-1: Framework [2], five facets are described
    for IoT interoperability, i.e. transport, semantic, syntactic, behavioural and
    policy. In this document, the following specifications for IoT interoperability
    from syntactic viewpoint are included;\r\n– A principle of how to achieve syntactic
    interoperability among IoT systems which include IoT devices\r\n– Requirements
    on information related to IoT devices for syntactic interoperability\r\n– A framework
    for processes on developing information exchange rules related to IoT devices
    from the syntactic viewpoint"
