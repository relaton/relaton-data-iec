abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be  downloaded
    \ from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 21000-2:2005 specifies:\r\n \r\n\t Model: The Digital Item Declaration
    Model describes a set of abstract terms and concepts to form a useful model for
    defining Digital Items. \r\n\t Representation: The Digital Item Declaration Language
    (DIDL) is based upon the terms and concepts defined in the above model. It contains
    the normative description of the syntax and semantics of each of the DIDL elements,
    as represented in XML. \r\n\t Schema: Informative XML schemas illustrating complete
    grammars for representation of the DID in XML conforming to the normative representation.
    \r\n\t Detailed Examples: Illustrative (non-normative) examples of DIDL documents
    are provided to aid in understanding the use of the specification and its potential
    applications. \r\n \r\nThe ISO/IEC 21000 (MPEG-21) series of International Standards
    defines an open framework for multimedia delivery and consumption, with both the
    content creator and content consumer as focal points. The vision for MPEG-21 is
    to define a multimedia framework<em>to enable transparent and augmented use of
    multimedia resources across a wide range of networks and devices</em> used by
    different communities.<br />\r\nThis second part of MPEG-21 (ISO/IEC 21000-2:2005)
    specifies a uniform and flexible abstraction and interoperable representation
    for declaring the structure and makeup of Digital Items. A Digital Item Declaration
    (DID) involves specifying the resources, metadata, and their interrelationships
    for a Digital Item. A DID is done using the Digital Item Declaration Language
    (DIDL)."
