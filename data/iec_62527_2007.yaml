abstract:
- content: STIL language constructs are defined to specify the DC conditions necessary
    to excute digital vectors on automated test equipment(ATE). STIL language extensions
    include structures for:(a) specifying the DC conditions for a device under test;
    specifying DC conditions either globally, by pattern burst, by pattern, or by
    vector;(c) specifying alternate DC levels;and (d) selecting DC levels and alternate
    levels within a period, much the same as timed format events.
