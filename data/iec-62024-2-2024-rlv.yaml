  content: "IEC 62024-2:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62024-2:2024
    specifies the measuring methods of the rated DC limits for inductors as defined
    below. Standardized measuring methods for the determination of ratings enable
    users to accurately compare the current ratings given in various manufacturers'
    data books. This document is applicable to leaded and surface mount inductors
    with dimensions according to IEC 62025-1 and generally with rated current less
    than 125 A, although inductors with rated current greater than 125 A are available
    that fall within the dimension restrictions of this document (no larger than a
    625 mm2 footprint). These inductors are typically used in DC‑to‑DC converters
    built on printed circuit boards (PCBs), for electronic and telecommunication equipment,
    and small size switching power supply units. The measuring methods are defined
    by the saturation and temperature rise limitations induced solely by direct current
    (DC).<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) extension of scope by increase
    of range of rated current from 22 A to 125 A;<br />\r\nb) extension of scope by
    increase of footprint limitation from 12 mm × 12 mm to 625 mm2;<br />\r\nc) addition
    of upper current limitation for Iclass B, Iclass C and Iclass D board to Table
    1;<br />\r\nd) revised application examples for Table 1;<br />\r\ne) addition
    of wire size references for current ranges between 22 A ≤ I ≤ 125 A to Table 2;<br
    />\r\nf) addition of crimp terminal references to Table 2;<br />\r\ng) addition
    of thermal camera method."
