abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63126:2025 defines additional testing requirements for photovoltaic
    (PV) modules deployed under conditions leading to higher module temperature which
    are beyond the scope of IEC 61215-1 and IEC 61730‑1 and the relevant component
    standards, IEC 62788‑1‑7, IEC 62788‑2‑1, IEC 62790 and IEC 62852. The testing
    conditions specified in IEC 61215-2 and IEC 61730-2 (and the relevant component
    standards IEC 62788‑1‑7, IEC 62788‑2‑1, IEC 62790 and IEC 62852) assumed that
    these standards are applicable for module deployment where the 98th percentile
    temperature (T98), that is the temperature that a module would be expected to
    exceed for 175,2 h per year, is less than 70 °C. This document defines two temperature
    regimes, temperature Level 1 and temperature Level 2, which were designed considering
    deployment in environments with mounting configurations such that the T98 is less
    than or equal to 80 °C for temperature Level 1, and less than or equal to 90 °C
    for temperature Level 2. This document provides recommended additional testing
    conditions within the IEC 61215 series, IEC 61730 series, IEC 62788‑1‑7, IEC 62788‑2‑1,
    IEC 62790 and IEC 62852 for module operation in temperature Levels 1 and 2. Successfully
    passing a higher Level for a test, sequence of tests, or complete testing for
    a higher Level is an implied passing of the relevant lower‑Level testing. For
    example, passing 200 thermal cycles for Level 2 is considered passing Level 0
    and Level 1 for 200 thermal cycles.
