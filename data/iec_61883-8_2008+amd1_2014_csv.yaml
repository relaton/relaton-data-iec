abstract:
- content: IEC 61883-8:2008+A1:2014 specifies a protocol for the transport of uncompressed
    or compressed video data in the 4:2:2 format of recommendation ITU-R BT.601 (including
    compatible extensions to this format for the higher and lower resolutions of other
    commonly used video resolutions) over high performance serial bus, as specified
    by IEEE Std 1394-1995 as amended by IEEE Std 1394a-2000 and IEEE Std 1394b-2002
    (collectively IEEE 1394). The data formats for the encapsulation of video data
    are compatible with those specified by IEC 61883-1. Associated audio data, if
    any, should be formatted as specified by IEC 61883-6.<strong>This consolidated
    version consists of the first edition (2008) and its amendment 1 (2014). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>
