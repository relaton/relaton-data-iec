abstract:
- content: Determines the information required to facilitate the use of thermal data
    and models for simulation of the thermal behaviour and verification of the correct
    functionality of electronic systems that include bare semiconductor die, with
    or without connection structures, and/or minimally packaged semiconductor die.
    Intends to assist all those involved in the supply chain for die devices to comply
    with the requirements of IEC 62258-1 and IEC 62258-2
