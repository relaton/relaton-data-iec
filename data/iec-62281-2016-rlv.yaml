  content: "IEC 62281:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 62281:2016
    specifies test methods and requirements for primary and secondary (rechargeable)
    lithium cells and batteries to ensure their safety during transport other than
    for recycling or disposal. Requirements specified in this standard do not apply
    in those cases where special provisions given in the relevant regulations, listed
    in 7.3, provide exemptions.<br />\r\nNOTE - Different standards may apply for
    lithium-ion traction battery systems used for electrically propelled road vehicles.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published in
    2012, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Deletion of the wire mesh screen from the evaluation of test criteria for an explosion;<br
    />\r\n- Extension / modification of the shock test parameters so as to achieve
    constant energy behaviour for large batteries as well as explanations in a new
    Annex A;<br />\r\n- Modification of the external short-circuit method so as to
    allow the short-circuit to be applied to large batteries after they have been
    removed from the temperature chamber;<br />\r\n- Change of the cell diameter distinguishing
    between impact and crush test from 20 mm to 18 mm;<br />\r\n- Addition of possible
    content for a transport certificate.</p>"
