abstract:
- content: "IEC 63093-5:2025 specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical
    interchangeability for a preferred range of EP-cores made of ferrite, the essential
    dimensions of coil formers to be used with them and the locations of their terminal
    pins on a 2,50 mm printed wiring grid in relation to the base outlines of the
    cores and the effective parameter values to be used in calculations involving
    them. It also gives guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable
    to EP-cores. The specifications contained in this document are useful in negotiations
    between ferrite core suppliers and users about surface irregularities. The general
    considerations upon which the design of this range of cores is based are as given
    in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of Table 2
    according to IEC 60205:2016."
