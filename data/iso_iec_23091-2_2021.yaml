abstract:
- content: This document defines various code points and fields that establish properties
    of a video (or still image) representation and are independent of the compression
    encoding and bit rate. These properties can describe the appropriate interpretation
    of decoded data or can, similarly, describe the characteristics of such a signal
    before the signal is compressed by an encoder that is suitable for compressing
    such an input signal.
