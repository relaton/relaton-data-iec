abstract:
- content: "<p>Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 defines a set of lossless and lossy
    compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, greyscale or colour
    digital still images. This Recommendation | International Standard provides three
    independently created software reference implementations of Rec. ITU-T T.800 |
    ISO/IEC 15444-1, in order to assist implementers of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC
    15444-1 in testing and understanding its content. The packages are JASPER, JJ2000
    and OPENJPEG.</p><p>This Recommendation | International Standard also provides
    an independently created software reference implementation of Rec. ITU-T T.814
    | ISO/IEC 15444-15, which specifies a high-throughput (HT) block coding algorithm
    that can be used in place of the block coding algorithm of Rec. ITU-T T.800 |
    ISO/IEC 15444-1, in order to assist implementers of Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC
    15444-15 in testing and understanding its content. The package is TT.</p><p>This
    Recommendation | International Standard additionally provides an independently
    created software reference implementation for parsing of a JP2 file format specified
    in Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 and a JPH file format specified in Rec.
    ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15, The package is Codestream-parser.</p><p>This Recommendation
    | International Standard does not define any additional part of the JPEG 2000
    image coding system.</p><p>Each version of the J2K reference software contains
    source code, which can be compiled to provide the following functionality:</p><p>–
    Transcoding from selected, widely available image formats into a JPEG 2000 codestream.</p><p>–
    Transcoding from selected, widely available image formats into the JP2 file format.</p><p>–
    Selection of a wide range of JPEG 2000 encoding options (as documented in each
    reference software).</p><p>– Decoding from a JPEG 2000 codestream to a range of
    selected widely available image formats.</p><p>– Processing of a JP2 file to extract
    a JPEG 2000 codestream for decoding and conversion to a range of selected widely
    available image formats.</p><p>– The ability to extract metadata from a JP2 file,
    including the contents of the Image Header box and the colour space.</p><p>– The
    decoding of JP2 files that use the three-component matrix-based form of the restricted
    ICC method for the specification of colour space and the conversion of the decoded
    image data to the sRGB colour space for display, including limited upsampling
    of all decoded components to the same resolution.</p><p>– The decoding of JP2
    files that use the monochrome form of the restricted ICC method for the specification
    of colour space and the conversion of the decoded image data to the sRGB based
    greyscale space as defined within the JP2 file format.</p><p>– The decoding of
    JP2 files that use the sYCC colour space and the conversion of the decoded image
    data to the sRGB colour space for display, including upsampling of all decoded
    components to the same resolution.</p><p>– Some additional tools to help with
    evaluation and testing.</p><p>The TT HTJ2K reference software contains source
    code, which can be compiled to provide the following functionality:</p><p>– Decoding
    from a HTJ2K codestream to a range of selected widely available image formats.</p><p>The
    codestream-parser reference software contains source code, which can provide the
    following functionality:</p><p>– Parsing of JP2 file format;</p><p>– Parsing of
    JPH file format.</p><p>The reference software is intended for use as a testing
    and validation tool for other implementations of JPEG 2000, and to help in the
    understanding of Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 and Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC
    15444-15.</p>"
