- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15444-5:2021 Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC 15444-1 defines a set of lossless and lossy
    compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, greyscale or colour
    digital still images. This Recommendation International Standard provides three
    independently created software reference implementations of Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC
    15444-1, in order to assist implementers of Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC 15444-1 in
    testing and understanding its content. The packages are JASPER, JJ2000 and OPENJPEG.<br
    />\r\nThis Recommendation International Standard also provides an independently
    created software reference implementation of Rec. ITU-T T.814 ISO/IEC 15444-15,
    which specifies a high-throughput (HT) block coding algorithm that can be used
    in place of the block coding algorithm of Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC 15444-1, in
    order to assist implementers of Rec. ITU-T T.814 ISO/IEC 15444-15 in testing and
    understanding its content. The package is TT.<br />\r\nThis Recommendation International
    Standard additionally provides an independently created software reference implementation
    for parsing of a JP2 file format specified in Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC 15444-1
    and a JPH file format specified in Rec. ITU-T T.814 ISO/IEC 15444-15, The package
    is Codestream-parser.<br />\r\nThis Recommendation International Standard does
    not define any additional part of the JPEG 2000 image coding system.<br />\r\nEach
    version of the J2K reference software contains source code, which can be compiled
    to provide the following functionality:<br />\r\n– Transcoding from selected,
    widely available image formats into a JPEG 2000 codestream.<br />\r\n– Transcoding
    from selected, widely available image formats into the JP2 file format.<br />\r\n–
    Selection of a wide range of JPEG 2000 encoding options (as documented in each
    reference software).<br />\r\n– Decoding from a JPEG 2000 codestream to a range
    of selected widely available image formats.<br />\r\n– Processing of a JP2 file
    to extract a JPEG 2000 codestream for decoding and conversion to a range of selected
    widely available image formats.<br />\r\n– The ability to extract metadata from
    a JP2 file, including the contents of the Image Header box and the colour space.<br
    />\r\n– The decoding of JP2 files that use the three-component matrix-based form
    of the restricted ICC method for the specification of colour space and the conversion
    of the decoded image data to the sRGB colour space for display, including limited
    upsampling of all decoded components to the same resolution.<br />\r\n– The decoding
    of JP2 files that use the monochrome form of the restricted ICC method for the
    specification of colour space and the conversion of the decoded image data to
    the sRGB based greyscale space as defined within the JP2 file format.<br />\r\n–
    The decoding of JP2 files that use the sYCC colour space and the conversion of
    the decoded image data to the sRGB colour space for display, including upsampling
    of all decoded components to the same resolution.<br />\r\n– Some additional tools
    to help with evaluation and testing.<br />\r\nThe TT HTJ2K reference software
    contains source code, which can be compiled to provide the following functionality:<br
    />\r\n– Decoding from a HTJ2K codestream to a range of selected widely available
    image formats.<br />\r\nThe codestream-parser reference software contains source
    code, which can provide the following functionality:<br />\r\n– Parsing of JP2
    file format;<br />\r\n– Parsing of JPH file format.<br />\r\nThe reference software
    is intended for use as a testing and validation tool for other implementations
    of JPEG 2000, and to help in the understanding of Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC 15444-1
    and Rec. ITU-T T.814 ISO/IEC 15444-15."
