abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63329:2020(E) This Book 14 defines three socketable LED Light Engines
    (with integrated Electronic Control Gears) and three socketable LED Modules (without
    integrated Electronic Control Gears). These LED Modules and LLEs have a rectangular
    shape and are typically applied in general lighting applications. These products
    are intended to be installed and replaced by professionals and non-professionals.
    This Book 1 defines the common concepts that underlie the Zhaga interface specifications.
    In addition, this Book 1 specifies general requirements for Zhaga compliant components
    of LED Luminaires.
