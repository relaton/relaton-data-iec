    The EDA Standards Roadmap Workshop was sponsored by the CAD Framework Initiative (CFI), Electronic Design Automation Companies (EDAC), and SEMATECH with participation by interested industry groups. The Workshop was specifically aimed at developing an
    industry-wide roadmap for development of design and test standards within Electronic Design Automation (EDA).
    There were three working groups, each charged with identifying requirements, understanding the current standards environment, and developing a roadmap to improved standards across the next decade for their area of focus:
     EDA Interoperability and Integration Working Group (EII)
     Technology Libraries and Models Working Group (TLM)
     Design and Data Management Working Group (DDM).
