    <p>This service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0<i>.</i></p>
    <p>This service type enables control over the transport of audio and video streams.  The service type defines a ?common' model for A/V transport control suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players, VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to control tuners.</p>
    <p>The service type is related to the ConnectionManager service type, which describes A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory service, which offers meta-information about the resource stored on the media. AVTransport also offers an action to retrieve any meta data embedded in the resource itself.</p>
    <p>This service type does not offer <i>scheduled</i> recording.</p>
