  content: "IEC 60384-9:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60384-9:2024
    is applicable to fixed capacitors of ceramic dielectric with a defined temperature
    coefficient (dielectric Class 2), intended for use in electronic equipment, including
    leadless capacitors but excluding fixed surface mount multilayer capacitors of
    ceramic dielectric, which are covered by IEC 60384-22 (Class 2). Capacitors for
    electromagnetic interference suppression are not included, but are covered by
    IEC 60384-14. The object of this document is to specify preferred ratings and
    characteristics and to select from IEC 60384-1:2021 the appropriate quality assessment
    procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance requirements
    for this type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements specified in detail
    specifications referring to this document provide specific test severities and
    requirements of an equal or higher performance level. Further information on the
    conception of generic, sectional and detail specifications can be found in the
    Introduction of IEC 60384-1:2021.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    The document has been completely restructured to comply with ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 2 and to make it more useable; tables, figures and references have been revised
    accordingly. Annex X contains all cross-references of changes in clause/subclause
    numbers.<br />\r\nb) The requirements of reference temperature 25 °C have been
    added in Table 7, Table 9, Table 11, Table 13 and Table 15.<br />\r\nc) The table
    of temperature characteristics of capacitance for the reference temperature 25
    °C have been added in Table B.1, Table B.2 and Table B.3.<br />\r\nd) Annex B
    has been changed from informative to normative.<br />\r\ne) Clause C.5 (Test schedule
    for quality conformance inspection) has been newly added to withdraw the blank
    detail specification: IEC 60384-9-1."
