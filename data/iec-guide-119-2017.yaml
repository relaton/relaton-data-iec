  content: "IEC Guide 119:2017(E) defines procedures for the preparation of energy
    efficiency (EE) publications and describes the relationship between technical
    committees (TCs) with group EE functions.<br />\r\nIn the context of this Guide,
    “EE” refers to energy efficiency of products, systems and organizations.<br />\r\nIt
    uses the boundary concept to address energy efficiency aspects (see IEC Guide
    118) in the context of a systems approach.<br />\r\nThis Guide is relevant to
    every TC which would like to publish a document dealing with EE."
