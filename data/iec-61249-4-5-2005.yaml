  content: "This part of IEC 61249 gives requirements for properties of prepreg that
    is mainly intended to be used as bonding sheets in connection with laminates according
    to IEC 61249-2-8 when manufacturing multilayer boards according to IEC 62326-4.
    This material may be also used to bond other types of laminates. \n\nPrepreg according
    to this standard is of defined flammability (vertical burning test). The flammability
    rating on fully cured prepreg is achieved through the use of brominated fire retardants
    contained as an integral part of the polymeric structure. After curing of the
    prepreg according to the supplier's instructions, the glass transition temperature
    is defined as 150 °C minimum."
