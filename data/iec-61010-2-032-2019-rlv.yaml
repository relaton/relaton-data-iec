  content: "IEC 61010-2-032:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61010-2-032:2019
    specifies safety requirements for hand-held and hand-manipulated current sensors
    described below. These current sensors are for measuring, detecting or injecting
    current, or indicating current waveforms on circuits without physically opening
    the current path of the circuit being measured. They can be stand-alone current
    sensors or accessories to other equipment or parts of combined equipment (see
    Figure 101). These include measurement circuits which are part of electrical test
    and measurement equipment, laboratory equipment, or process control equipment.
    These current sensors and circuits need additional protective means between the
    current sensor, the circuit and an operator. This fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- It has been indicated that current sensors
    used as fixed equipment are not within the scope of this document.<br />\r\n-
    Fork-style current sensors have been added.<br />\r\n- Requirements from Part
    2-033 applicable to clamp multimeters that have a primary purpose of measuring
    voltage on live mains have been included in the new normative Annex EE.<br />\r\n-
    Clearances and creepage distances for measuring circuit terminals exceeding 1
    000 V a.c. or 1 414 V d.c. and for wet locations have been specified.<br />\r\n-
    Reduced creepage distances are allowed to be according to material group I for
    all insulating materials.<br />\r\n- Requirements for input/output circuits of
    Type A, Type B and Type C current sensors have been detailed in 6.9.102.<br />\r\n-
    Requirements for output circuit leads have been modified.<br />\r\n- The Jaw impact
    test has been limited to the front of the jaws.<br />\r\n- The abrasion test for
    cords of flexible current sensors has been removed and replaced by a pressure
    test at high temperature.<br />\r\n- The voltage source for testing overvoltage
    limiting components or circuits may be limited to 400 V.<br />\r\n- Reference
    to IEC 61010-031 for probe assemblies has been added.<br />\r\n- Requirements
    for the prevention of transient overvoltages for mains voltage measuring circuits
    have been added.<br />\r\n- Requirements for measuring circuits from 1 000 V to
    3 000 V have been added.<br />\r\n- An informative Annex CC about the dimensions
    of banana terminals has been added.<br />\r\n- A flowchart for insulation according
    to the type of circuit has been added in a new Annex DD.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of February 2020 have been included in this copy.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol
