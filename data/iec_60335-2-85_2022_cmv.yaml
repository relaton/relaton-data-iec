abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-85:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-85:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-85:2002+AMD1:2008+AMD2:2017
    CSV edition 2.2. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-85:2022 deals
    with the safety of electric fabric steamers intended for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use, but that nevertheless possibly pose a source
    of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    laundries and dry cleaners, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n– persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– electric
    irons (IEC 60335-2-3);<br />\r\n– ironers (IEC 60335-2-44);<br />\r\n– surface-cleaning
    appliances for household use employing liquids or steam (IEC 60335 2 54);<br />\r\n–
    appliances connected to the water mains.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment
    2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) introduction of pressurized fabric steamer.<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
