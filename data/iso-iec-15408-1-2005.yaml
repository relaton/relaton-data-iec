  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15408-1:2005 defines two forms for expressing IT security functional
    and assurance requirements. The protection profile (PP) construct allows creation
    of generalized reusable sets of these security requirements. The PP can be used
    by prospective consumers for specification and identification of products with
    IT security features which will meet their needs. The security target (ST) expresses
    the security requirements and specifies the security functions for a particular
    product or system to be evaluated, called the target of evaluation (TOE). The
    ST is used by evaluators as the basis for evaluations conducted in accordance
    with ISO/IEC 15408.</p>"
