abstract:
- content: "IEC 61557-3:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61557-3:2019
    specifies the requirements applicable to equipment for measuring the loop impedance
    between a line conductor and protective conductor; between a line conductor and
    neutral; or between two line conductors by using the voltage drop when the circuit
    under test is loaded. IEC 61557-3:2019 cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) addition of equirements as regards the measurement category;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of new requirements for operating instructions;<br />\r\nc)
    alignment of the structure with that of the whole IEC 61557 series."
