abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62607-4-3:2015(E) provides a standardized test method for the measurement
    of contact and coating resistivity of nano-enabled electrode materials. This method
    will enable a customer to decide whether or not a coating composite material is
    usable, and select best combinations of coating composite material with fabrication
    technologies suitable for their application.
