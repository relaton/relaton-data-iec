abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a measurement framework (MF) and an organization
    maturity model (OMM). It provides the overview of how an organization can use
    the process reference model (PRM) in ISO/IEC 30105-1 and the process assessment
    model (PAM) in ISO/IEC 30105-2 to measure their capability and maturity levels.
    It conforms to the requirements of ISO/IEC 33003 and ISO/IEC 33004 and supports
    the performance assessment by providing a framework to measure and derive capability
    and organization maturity levels.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to be used
    in concurrence with the other parts of the ISO/IEC 30105 series and the assessment
    approach provided by ISO/IEC 33002 for assessing processes."
