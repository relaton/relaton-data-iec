abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15962:2022 This document focuses on encoding the transfer syntax
    of the application commands defined in ISO/IEC 15961-1. The encodation is in a
    Logical Memory as a software analogue of the physical memory of the RFID tag being
    addressed by the interrogator.<br />\r\nThis document<br />\r\n- defines the encoded
    structure of object identifiers;<br />\r\n- specifies the data compaction rules
    that apply to the encoded data;<br />\r\n- specifies a Precursor for encoding
    syntax features efficiently;<br />\r\n- specifies formatting rules for the data,
    e.g. depending on whether a directory is used or not;<br />\r\n- defines how application
    commands, e.g. to lock data, are transferred to the Tag Driver;<br />\r\n- specifies
    processes associated with sensory information and the transfers to the Tag Driver;<br
    />\r\n- defines other communication to the application."
