abstract:
- content: "<p>This document focuses on encoding the transfer syntax of the application
    commands defined in ISO/IEC 15961-1. The encodation is in a Logical Memory as
    a software analogue of the physical memory of the RFID tag being addressed by
    the interrogator.</p><p>This document</p><p>— defines the encoded structure of
    object identifiers;</p><p>— specifies the data compaction rules that apply to
    the encoded data;</p><p>— specifies a Precursor for encoding syntax features efficiently;</p><p>—
    specifies formatting rules for the data, e.g. depending on whether a directory
    is used or not;</p><p>— defines how application commands, e.g. to lock data, are
    transferred to the Tag Driver;</p><p>— specifies processes associated with sensory
    information and the transfers to the Tag Driver;</p><p>— defines other communication
    to the application.</p>"
