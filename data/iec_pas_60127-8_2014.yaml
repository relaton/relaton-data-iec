abstract:
- content: "IEC/PAS 60127-8:2014(E) relates to fuse resistors with particular overcurrent
    protection rated up to 500 V a.c. and/or 500 V d.c. for printed circuits and other
    substrate systems, used for the protection of electric appliances, electronic
    equipment and component parts thereof, normally intended to be used indoors. It
    does not apply to fuse resistors with particular overcurrent protection for appliances
    intended to be used under special conditions, such as in a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere. The object of this PAS is:<br />\r\n- to establish uniform requirements
    for fuse resistors with particular overcurrent protection so as to protect appliances
    or parts of appliances in the most suitable way;<br />\r\n- to define the performance
    of the fuse resistors with particular overcurrent protection, so as to give guidance
    to manufacturers of electrical appliances and electronic equipment and to ensure
    replacement of fuse resistors with particular overcurrent protection by those
    of similar dimensions and characteristics;<br />\r\n- to define methods of testing.
    This PAS applies in addition to the requirements of IEC 60127-1. Keywords: resistors
    with particular overcurrent protection, protection of electric appliances, electronic
    equipment and component parts"
