abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-13:2007 specifies commands for application management
    in a multi-application environment. These commands cover the entire life cycle
    of applications in a multi-application integrated circuit card, and the commands
    can be used before and after the card is issued to the cardholder. ISO/IEC 7816-13:2007
    does not cover the implementation within the card and/or the outside world.</p>"
