    ISO/IEC 29167-17:2015 defines the cryptoGPS cryptographic suite for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices that might be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and application standards.

    ISO/IEC 29167-17:2015 defines a lightweight mechanism using asymmetric techniques and providing a unilateral authentication mechanism whose security is related to the difficulty of taking discrete logarithms on elliptic curves.
