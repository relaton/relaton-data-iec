  content: "IEC 61326-1:2012 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61326-1:2012 specifies
    requirements for immunity and emissions regarding electro-magnetic compatibility
    (EMC) for electrical equipment, operating from a supply or battery of less than
    1 000 V a.c. or 1 500 V d.c. or from the circuit being measured. Equipment intended
    for professional, industrial-process, industrial-manufacturing and educational
    use is covered by this part. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition, published in 2005. It constitutes a technical revision. The significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n- the immunity
    test levels and performance criteria have been reviewed;<br />\r\n- requirements
    for portable test and measurement equipment have been clarified and amended;<br
    />\r\n- the description of the electromagnetic environments has been improved."
