  content: 'IEC 63098-2:2022 provides the required performance with reliability and
    quality assurance of radio-over-fiber-based fronthaul networks for railway communication
    networks between trains and tracksides, as well as a design guide for network
    configuration. A high-speed train communication network comprises two parts: a
    back-end network and wireless access system to deliver data to train cars. In
    this back-end network, optical fiber communication-based networks are generally
    utilized to reduce the complexity of the radio access units set along the railway
    track, which delivers the signal wirelessly to the train car, wireless signals
    are generated and processed at a central office, and then are transported via
    an optical fiber network into the radio access units. A radio-over-fiber fronthaul
    network is configured to transport the wireless signal, which is applicable between
    a node base station and radio access units set at a trackside. The radio-over-fiber-based
    fronthaul link connects the node base station to the trackside radio access units
    and carries millimeter-wave subcarrier or intermediate frequency components to
    transmit high-capacity signals.'
