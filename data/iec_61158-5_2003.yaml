abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61158 is one of a series produced to facilitate the interconnection
    of automation system components. It is related to other standards in the set as
    defined by the three-layer fieldbus Reference Model, which is based in part on
    the Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection. Both Reference Models
    subdivide the area of standardization for interconnection into a series of layers
    of specification, each of manageable size. The Application Service is provided
    by the Application Protocol making use of the services available from the Data
    Link or other immediately lower layer. This part of the IEC 61158 series defines
    the Application Service characteristics that any immediately higher-level protocols
    may exploit. The contents of the corrigendum of July 2004 have been included in
    this copy.
