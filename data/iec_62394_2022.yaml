abstract:
- content: "IEC 62394:2022 specifies requirements for service diagnostic software
    to be implemented in products that incorporate a digital interface. It does not
    specify requirements for carrying out remote diagnosis or for manufacturer-dependent
    software.<br />\r\nThe Service Diagnostic Interface (SDI) requires an external
    controller (exclusive or general-purpose/PC) into which service diagnostic software
    can be loaded. Parts of the controller software are standardized while other parts
    are proprietary to the manufacturers.<br />\r\nTo reach a common approach in servicing
    all products from all manufacturers, it is necessary to standardize specific items
    to be tested in products and certain aspects of controllers' diagnostic software.<br
    />\r\nThe SDI is based upon ECHONET specification version 2.11, ECHONET Lite specification
    version 1.13, and APPENDIX Detailed Requirements for ECHONET Device objects Release
    M, because this interface will be used in future products. The use of this connection
    and existing communication protocols enable implementation in products at a low
    cost, with maximum flexibility and efficiency.<br />\r\nThe SDI consists of<br
    />\r\n• specific hardware and software requirements of the device under test (DUT);<br
    />\r\n• specific requirements of the controller:<br />\r\n– the service software;<br
    />\r\n– an ECHONET interface;<br />\r\n• the connection between the controller
    and the DUT.<br />\r\nThis document provides the minimal requirements necessary
    to carry out computerized diagnosis. It covers the standardized software of the
    controller as well as the standardized software and provisions in the DUT.<br
    />\r\nIEC 62394:2022 cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2017.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) updates of the device object super class specifications for the property
    configurations shared by all device objects;<br />\r\nb) modification and addition
    of the property configurations defined by each object;<br />\r\nc) addition of
    new device objects and their property configurations;<br />\r\nd) updates to Bibliography."
