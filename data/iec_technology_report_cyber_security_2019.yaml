abstract:
- content: "The energy business sector is undergoing profound changes. The transition
    to clean energy is underway and society is increasingly reliant on electrical
    energy. However, the business environment is more risky and mounting competition
    requires the continual improvement of end-user services.<br /><br />\r\nSimultaneously,
    the energy sector has accelerated its evolution towards digitization thus heightening
    its reliance on cyber assets, including systems, controllers and intelligent devices,
    to manage the delivery of electrical energy.<br /><br />\r\nHowever, these cyber
    assets present serious challenges and businesses must determine how to cope with
    the reality of deliberate cyber attacks as well as how to remain resilient in
    the face of inadvertent cyber threats arising from personnel mistakes, the complexity
    of systems, equipment failure and natural disaster. Energy businesses that traditionally
    addressed only the system engineering process must now include cyber security
    services and technologies.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC Technology Report provides
    guidelines to help executives in the smart energy operational environment understand
    the necessary cyber security policies, procedures and technologies that need to
    be implemented. It was prepared by the task force on cyber security in the  IEC
    Systems Committee on Smart energy  Working Group 3.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC Technology
    Report is available for  free download."
