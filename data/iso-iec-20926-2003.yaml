    <p>ISO/IEC 20926:2003 specifies the International Function Point Users Group (IFPUG) Release 4.1 unadjusted Functional Size Measurement Method. </p>
    <p>It provides:a clear and detailed description of function point counting;</p>
    <ul><li>a foundation to ensure that counts are consistent;</li><li>guidance to allow function point counting of Functional User Requirements from the deliverables of popular software development methodologies and techniques;</li><li>a framework to enable automated support for function point counting.</li></ul>
    <p>The provisions of ISO/IEC 20926:2003 can be applied by anyone using function point analysis for software measurement. ISO/IEC 20926:2003 was designed for use by persons new to function point counting as well as those with intermediate and advanced experience.</p>
