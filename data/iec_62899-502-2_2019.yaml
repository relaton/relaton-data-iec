abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-502-2:2019(E) specifies the combined mechanical and environmental
    stress test methods for flexible OLED (organic light emitting diode) elements
    fabricated using the printing method. Mechanical stress tests include the static
    and cycling vending test, and the dynamic and static rolling test.
