abstract:
- content: "ISO 17363:2013 defines the usage of read/write radio-frequency identification
    technology (RFID) cargo shipment-specific tags associated with containerized freight
    for supply chain management purposes (\"manifest tags\"). ISO 17363:2013 defines
    the air interface communications, a common set of required data structures, and
    a commonly organized, through common syntax and semantics, set of optional data
    requirements.<br /><br />\r\nISO 17363:2013:<br />\r\na) makes recommendations
    about a second generation supply chain tag intended to monitor the condition and
    security of the freight resident within a freight container;<br />\r\nb) specifies
    the implementation of sensors for freight resident in a freight container;<br
    />\r\nc) makes specific recommendations about mandatory non-reprogrammable information
    on the shipment tag;<br />\r\nd) makes specific recommendations about optional,
    re-programmable information on the shipment tag;<br />\r\ne) makes specific recommendations
    about the data link interface for GPS or GLS services;<br />\r\nf) specifies the
    reuse and recyclability of the RF tag;<br />\r\ng) specifies the means by which
    the data in a compliant RF tag is \"backed-up\" by bar codes and two-dimensional
    symbols, as well as human-readable information."
