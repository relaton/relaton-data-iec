    tags associated with containerized freight for supply chain management purposes
    (\"manifest tags\"). ISO 17363:2013 defines the air interface communications,
    a common set of required data structures, and a commonly organized, through common
    syntax and semantics, set of optional data requirements.<br /><br />\r\nISO 17363:2013:<br
    />\r\na) makes recommendations about a second generation supply chain tag intended
    to monitor the condition and security of the freight resident within a freight
    container;<br />\r\nb) specifies the implementation of sensors for freight resident
    in a freight container;<br />\r\nc) makes specific recommendations about mandatory
    non-reprogrammable information on the shipment tag;<br />\r\nd) makes specific
    recommendations about optional, re-programmable information on the shipment tag;<br
    />\r\ne) makes specific recommendations about the data link interface for GPS
    or GLS services;<br />\r\nf) specifies the reuse and recyclability of the RF tag;<br
    />\r\ng) specifies the means by which the data in a compliant RF tag is \"backed-up\"
