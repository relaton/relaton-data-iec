  content: IEC 62977-2-2:2020(E) specifies standard measurement conditions and measuring
    methods for determining the optical characteristics of electronic displays under
    indoor and outdoor illumination conditions. Standard illumination geometries are
    specified and the reflection properties of flat screens are determined under those
    conditions. Reference illumination levels and spectra are used to estimate the
    photometric and colorimetric characteristics of electronic displays under the
    same conditions. These methods apply to emissive, transmissive, and reflective
    displays, or combinations thereof, that render real 2D images on a flat screen.
