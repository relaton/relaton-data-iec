  content: "IEC 62040-1:2017 EXV includes the provisions of the general rules dealt
    with in <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7080\">IEC 62477-1:2012</a>.
    The Extended version is not an official IEC Standard. Only the current versions
    of the related standards are to be considered the official documents. The Extended
    version is available in English only.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62040-1:2017 applies
    to movable, stationary, fixed or built-in UPS for use in low-voltage distribution
    systems and that are intended to be installed in an area accessible by an ordinary
    person or in a restricted access area as applicable, that deliver fixed frequency
    AC output voltage with port voltages not exceeding 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC and
    that include an energy storage device. It applies to pluggable and to permanently
    connected UPS, whether consisting of a system of interconnected units or of independent
    units, subject to installing, operating and maintaining the UPS in the manner
    prescribed by the manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis document specifies requirements
    to ensure safety for the ordinary person who comes into contact with the UPS and,
    where specifically stated, for the skilled person. The objective is to reduce
    risks of fire, electric shock, thermal, energy and mechanical hazards during use
    and operation and, where specifically stated, during service and maintenance.<br
    />\r\nThis product standard is harmonized with the applicable parts of group safety
    publication IEC 62477-1:2012 for power electronic converter systems and contains
    additional requirements relevant to UPS.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical change with respect to the previous edition: the reference
    document has been changed from IEC 60950-1:2005 (safety for IT equipment) to IEC
    62477-1 (group safety standard for power electronic converters).<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of October 2019 have been included in this copy."
