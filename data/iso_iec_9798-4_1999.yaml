abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 9798 specifies entity authentication mechanisms
    using a cryptographic check function. Two</p><p>mechanisms are concerned with
    the authentication of a single entity (unilateral authentication), while the remaining</p><p>are
    mechanisms for mutual authentication of two entities.</p><p>The mechanisms specified
    in this part of ISO/IEC 9798 use time variant parameters such as time stamps,</p><p>sequence
    numbers, or random numbers, to prevent valid authentication information from being
    accepted at a later</p><p>time or more than once.</p><p>If a time stamp or sequence
    number is used, one pass is needed for unilateral authentication, while two passes
    are</p><p>needed to achieve mutual authentication. If a challenge and response
    method employing random numbers is</p><p>used, two passes are needed for unilateral
    authentication, while three passes are required to achieve mutual</p><p>authentication.</p><p>Examples
    of cryptographic check functions are given in ISO/IEC 9797.</p>"
