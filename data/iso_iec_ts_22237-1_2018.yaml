abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC TS 22237-1:2018:</p><p>a) details the issues to be addressed
    in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling application of an appropriate
    classification of the data centre;</p><p>b) defines the common aspects of data
    centres including terminology, parameters and reference models (functional elements
    and their accommodation) addressing both the size and complexity of their intended
    purpose;</p><p>c) describes general aspects of the facilities and infrastructures
    required to support effective operation of telecommunications within data centres;</p><p>d)
    specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of "availability",
    "security" and "energy-efficiency" over the planned lifetime of the data centre,
    for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;</p><p>e) describes
    the general design principles for data centres upon which the requirements of
    the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series are based including symbols, labels, coding in drawings,
    quality assurance and education.</p><p>The following topics are outside of the
    scope of the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series:</p><p>1) the selection of information technology
    and network telecommunications equipment, software and associated configuration
    issues;</p><p>2) safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements (covered
    by other standards and regulations). However, information given in the ISO/IEC
    TS 22237 series may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations).</p>
