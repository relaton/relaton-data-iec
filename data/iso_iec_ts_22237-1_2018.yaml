abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 22237-1:2018:<br />\r\na) details the issues to be addressed
    in a business risk and operating cost analysis enabling application of an appropriate
    classification of the data centre;<br />\r\nb) defines the common aspects of data
    centres including terminology, parameters and reference models (functional elements
    and their accommodation) addressing both the size and complexity of their intended
    purpose;<br />\r\nc) describes general aspects of the facilities and infrastructures
    required to support effective operation of telecommunications within data centres;<br
    />\r\nd) specifies a classification system, based upon the key criteria of \"availability\",
    \"security\" and \"energy-efficiency\" over the planned lifetime of the data centre,
    for the provision of effective facilities and infrastructure;<br />\r\ne) describes
    the general design principles for data centres upon which the requirements of
    the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series are based including symbols, labels, coding in drawings,
    quality assurance and education.<br />\r\nThe following topics are outside of
    the scope of the ISO/IEC TS 22237 series:<br />\r\n1) the selection of information
    technology and network telecommunications equipment, software and associated configuration
    issues;<br />\r\n2) safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements
    (covered by other standards and regulations). However, information given in the
    ISO/IEC TS 22237 series may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations)."
