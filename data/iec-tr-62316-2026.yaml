  content: "IEC TR 62316:2026 which is a Technical report, provides guidance on the
    interpretation of backscattering traces, as obtained by traditional optical time
    domain reflectometers (OTDRs) for single-mode fibres. This document does not cover
    Polarization OTDRs. Also, backscattered power effects are discussed in case of
    unidirectional trace. Full description of the test measurement procedure can be
    found in Annex C of IEC 60793‑1‑40:2024. This fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update of the fibre types;<br />\r\nb) addition
    of information as regards attenuation uniformity."
