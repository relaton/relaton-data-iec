abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008/Suppl.2:2011 is concerned with measurement
    models having any number of input quantities and any number of output quantities.
    The quantities involved might be real or complex. Two approaches are considered
    for treating such models. The first approach is a generalization of the GUM uncertainty
    framework. The second is a Monte Carlo method as an implementation of the propagation
    of distributions. Appropriate use of the Monte Carol method would be expected
    to provide valid results when the applicability of the GUM uncertainty framework
    is questionable.</p><p>For a prescribed coverage probability, ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008/Suppl.2:2011
    can be used to provide a coverage region for the output quantities of a multivariate
    model, the counterpart of a coverage interval for a single scalar output quantiy.
    The provision of coverage regions includes those taking the form of a hyper-ellipsoid
    or a hyper-rectangle. These coverage regions are produced from the results of
    the two approaches described here. A procedure for providing an approximation
    to the smallest coverage region, obtained from results provided by the Monte Carol
    method, is also given. Detailed examples to illustrate the guidance are provided.</p>"
