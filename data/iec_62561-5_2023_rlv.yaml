abstract:
- content: "IEC 62561-5:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62561-5:2023
    specifies the requirements and tests for earth electrode inspection housings (earth
    housings) installed in the earth and for earth electrode seals. Lightning protection
    system components (LPSC) can also be suitable for use in hazardous atmospheres.
    For this reason, there are additional requirements when installing the components
    under such conditions. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) A classification of earth electrode seals has been added."
