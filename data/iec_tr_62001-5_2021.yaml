abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62001:2021(E), which is a Technical Report, provides guidance on
    the state-of-the art of VSC technology in relation to harmonics and predicted
    future developments, on the harmonic profile of present and predicted future VSC
    architectures and how they are characterised and modelled â€“ as voltage sources,
    current sources, or otherwise. It also assesses the harmonic impedance of VSC
    and the possible impact on pre-existing background harmonics emanating from loads
    or generation units in the supply network and considers how VSC harmonics are
    assessed under current IEC standards and national regulations, and identify areas
    where improvements could be made, research can be needed, or other bodies consulted,
    for example when considering interharmonics. This document can be a reference
    source on the subject, which will also contain recommendations for use by those
    charged with modifying existing standards to adapt to VSC HVDC systems.
