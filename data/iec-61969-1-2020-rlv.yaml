  content: "IEC 61969-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61969-1:2020
    contains design guidelines for outdoor enclosures and is applicable over a wide
    field of mechanical, electromechanical and electronic equipment and its installation
    where a modular design is used. The objectives of this document are:<br />\r\n-
    to provide an overview of specifications for enclosures focused on requirements
    for outdoor applications for stationary use at non-weather protected locations,
    and<br />\r\n- to achieve product integrity under outdoor conditions and to ease
    product selection for the sourcing of outdoor enclosures from different vendors.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- alignment with the content of ETSI EN 300 019 and IEC 60721 series latest
    editions, particularly with the actualization of climate conditions;<br />\r\n-
    new requirements added to reflect market requirements on environmental issues;<br
    />\r\n- improvement on terminology and overall editorial improvement."
