abstract:
- content: "IEC 62153-4-15:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62153-4-15:2021
    specifies the procedures for measuring with triaxial cell the transfer impedance,
    screening attenuation or the coupling attenuation of connectors, cable assemblies
    and components, for example accessories for analogue and digital transmission
    systems, and equipment for communication networks and cabling. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015.This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) measurement of coupling attenuation of balanced connectors, assemblies
    and components with balun and balunless added;<br />\r\nb) application of a test
    adapter was added;<br />\r\nc) application of a moveable shorting plane;<br />\r\nd)
    application of the triaxial \"absorber\" cell;<br />\r\ne) correction of test
    results in the case that the receiver input impedance R is higher than the characteristic
    impedance of the outer circuit Z<sub>2</sub>."
