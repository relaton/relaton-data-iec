    <p>This document specifies the data migration method for DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, +R, +RW, CD-R, CD-RW, BD Recordable and BD Rewritable disks for long-term data storage. By applying this document for information storage, digital data can be migrated to a next new disk without loss from the present disk if data errors are completely corrected before and during the migration and provided copying of the data is allowed.</p>
    <p>This document specifies:</p>
    <p>—     a data migration method for long-term data storage;</p>
    <p>—     test methods for measuring maximum data error, including ambient condition, test area, test drive, disk preparation and test execution;</p>
    <p>—     an initial performance test and a periodic performance test that check an error rate of data recorded on the disks with categorized maximum data error tables;</p>
    <p>—     precautions to reduce the possibility of deterioration in order to assure the integrity of the disks during their use, storage, handling or transportation; and</p>
    <p>—     the estimated lifetime of <i>B</i><sub>mig</sub> (<i>B</i><sub>0,000 1</sub>) life to determine the test interval for the periodic performance test.</p>
