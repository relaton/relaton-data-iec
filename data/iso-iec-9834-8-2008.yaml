    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 specifies the format and generation rules that enable users to produce128-bit identifiers that are either guaranteed to be globally unique, or are globally unique with a high probability.</p>
    <p>The UUIDs generated in conformance with ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 are suitable either fortransient use, with generation of a new UUID every 100 nanoseconds, or as persistent identifiers.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 is derived from earlier non-standard specifications of UUIDs and theirgeneration, and is technically identical to those earlier specifications.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 specifies the procedures for the operation of a Web-based RegistrationAuthority for UUIDs.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 also specifies and allows the use of UUIDs (registered or not registered) as primary values (which define Unicode labels) for arcs beneath the Joint UUID arc. This enables users to generateand use such arcs without any registration procedures.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-8:2008 also specifies and allows the use of UUIDs (registered or not registered) to form a URN.</p>
