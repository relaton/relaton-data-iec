abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62788-7-2:2017(E) defines test procedures to characterize the weatherability
    of polymeric component materials used in photovoltaic (PV) modules or systems.
    The methods in this document have been focused on polymeric backsheets and encapsulants,
    but may be applied to other materials; however, these were not verified as part
    of the preparation. Exposures in this document are intended for reference by other
    standards and as a tool to support research and product development for PV components
    and modules. Different exposures may be used to target specific climate/mounting
    configurations, with the specifics of how to apply the exposures left to those
    standards (e.g. component characterization standards, module qualification standards).
