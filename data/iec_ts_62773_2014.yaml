abstract:
- content: 'IEC TS 62773:2014 establishes a procedure to be used by rail transport
    authorities and/or radio suppliers to determine the appropriate performance requirements
    of radio system for a radio-based train control system, consistent with their
    specific business needs and existing conditions: the Technical Specification itself
    consists in defining a procedure linking preconditions to some radio parameters.
    Then, the appropriate performance requirements are deduced by the user of the
    Technical Specification from the radio parameters.'
