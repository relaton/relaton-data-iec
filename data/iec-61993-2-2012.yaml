  script: Latn
  content: IEC 61993-2:2012(E) specifies the minimum operational and performance requirements,
    methods of testing and required test results conforming to performance standards
    adopted by the IMO in Resolution MSC.74(69), Annex 3, Shipborne Automatic Identification
    System. This standard incorporates the applicable technical characteristics of
    Class A shipborne equipment included in Recommendation ITU-R M.1371-4 and takes
    into account the ITU Radio Regulations, where applicable. In addition, it takes
    account of IMO Resolution A.694(17) to which IEC 60945 is associated. When a requirement
    in this standard is different from IEC 60945, the requirement of this standard
    takes precedence. This International Standard also specifies the minimum requirements
    both for the means to input and display data and for the interfaces to other equipment
    suitable to be used as means of input and display data. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition, published in 2001. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.
