abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines various code points and fields that establish
    properties of a video (or still image) representation and are independent of the
    compression encoding and bit rate. These properties could describe the appropriate
    interpretation of decoded data or could, similarly, describe the characteristics
    of such a signal before the signal is compressed by an encoder that is suitable
    for compressing such an input signal.</p>"
