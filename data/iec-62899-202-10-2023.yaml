  content: "IEC 62899-202-10:2023 defines terminology and measurement methods for
    the resistance change of conductive ink layer(s) as a function of thermoplastic
    elongation. The method measures resistance changes in-situ or post-elongation.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to thermoformable substrates with conductive
    ink layers. The thermoformable substrates can have printed graphic ink as well
    and cover insulation layers."
