  content: "IEC 63505:2025 gives guidance on VT measurement methods and conditioning
    prior to VT testing in SiC power MOSFETs to reduce or eliminate the effect of
    the aforementioned hysteresis. The method is applicable for PBTI testing, NBTI
    and threshold voltage changes caused by switching events are excluded from the
    scope.<br />\r\nSiC MOSFETs have threshold voltage hysteresis caused by transient
    trap effects, which impacts the evaluation of the actual the VT shift caused by
    stress tests such as bias temperature instabilities (BTI)."
