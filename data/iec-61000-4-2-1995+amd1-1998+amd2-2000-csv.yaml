abstract:

  script: Latn
  content: 'This publication is based on IEC 60801-2 (second edition: 1991). It relates
    to the immunity requirements and test methods for electrical and electronic equipment
    subjected to static electricity discharges, from operators directly, and to adjacent
    objects. It additionally defines ranges of test levels which relate to different
    environmental and installation conditions and establishes test procedures. The
    object of this standard is to establish a common and reproducible basis for evaluating
    the performance of electrical and electronic equipment when subjected to electrostatic
    discharges. In addition, it includes electrostatic discharges which may occur
    from personnel to objects near vital equipment. This consolidated version consists
    of the first edition (1995), its amendment 1 (1998) and its amendment 2 (2000).
    Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.'
