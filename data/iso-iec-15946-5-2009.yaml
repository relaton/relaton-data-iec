    <p>ISO/IEC 15946 specifies public-key cryptographic techniques based on elliptic curves. They include the establishment of keys for secret-key systems and digital signature mechanisms. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15946-5:2009 defines the elliptic curve generation techniques useful for implementing the mechanisms defined in ISO/IEC 9796-3, ISO/IEC 11770-3, ISO/IEC 14888-3, and ISO/IEC 18033-2. </p>
    <p>The scope of ISO/IEC 15946-5:2009 is restricted to cryptographic techniques based on elliptic curves defined over finite fields of prime power order (including the special cases of prime order and characteristic two). The representation of elements of the underlying finite field (i.e. which basis is used) is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 15946-5:2009. ISO/IEC 15946 does not specify the implementation of the techniques it defines. Interoperability of products complying with ISO/IEC 15946 will not be guaranteed.</p>
