    Describes the frequency bands used for broadcasting below 30 MHz:
    Low frequency (LF) band - from 148,5 kHz to 283,5 kHz, in ITU Region 1 [1]* only;
    Medium frequency (MF) band - from 526,5 kHz to 1 606,5 kHz, in ITU Regions 1 [1] and 3 [1] and from 525 kHz to 1 705 kHz in ITU Region 2 [1];
    High frequency (HF) bands - a set of individual broadcasting bands in the frequency range 2,3 MHz to 27 MHz, generally available on a Worldwide basis.
    These bands offer unique propagation capabilities that permit the achievement of:
    Large coverage areas, whose size and location may be dependent upon the time of day, season of the year or period in the (approximately) 11 year sunspot cycle;
    Portable and mobile reception with relatively little impairment caused by the environment surrounding the receiver.
