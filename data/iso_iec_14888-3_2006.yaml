abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14888-3:2006 specifies digital signature mechanisms with appendix
    whose security is based on the discrete logarithm problem. It provides a general
    description of a digital signature with appendix mechanism, and a variety of mechanisms
    that provide digital signatures with appendix.</p><p>For each mechanism, ISO/IEC
    14888-3:2006 specifies the process of generating keys, the process of producing
    signatures, and the process of verifying signatures.</p><p>The verification of
    a digital signature requires the signing entity's verification key. It is thus
    essential for a verifier to be able to associate the correct verification key
    with the signing entity, or more precisely, with (parts of) the signing entity's
    identification data. This association may be provided by another means that is
    not covered in ISO/IEC 14888-3:2006. Whatever the nature of such means, the scheme
    is then said to be 'certificate-based'. If not, the association between the correct
    verification key and the signing entity's identification data is somehow inherent
    in the verification key itself. In such a case, the scheme is said to be 'identity-based'.
    Depending on the two different ways of checking the correctness of the verification
    keys, the digital signature mechanisms specified in ISO/IEC 14888-3:2006 are categorized
    in two groups: certificate-based and identity-based.</p>"
