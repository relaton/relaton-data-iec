abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17811-3:2014 provides the specification of Reliable Message
    Delivery Protocol (RMDP), which is an application-layer protocol used to provide
    uniform and reliable message delivery among devices regardless of the underlying
    network protocols or interfaces.</p><p>The network security is out of scope in
    this part of ISO/IEC 17811. However, the security services might be necessary
    according to applications of RMDP. RMDP might suffer from many network-specific
    threats. To countermeasure those threats, some security mechanism can be deployed.</p>"
