abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 15026-1:2010 defines terms and establishes an extensive and
    organized set of concepts and their relationships, thereby establishing a basis
    for shared understanding of the concepts and principles central to ISO/IEC 15026
    across its user communities. It provides information to users of the subsequent
    parts of ISO/IEC 15026, including the use of each part and the combined use of
    multiple parts. Coverage of assurance for a service being operated and managed
    on an ongoing basis is not covered in ISO/IEC 15026.
