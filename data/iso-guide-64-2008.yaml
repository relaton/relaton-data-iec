  content: "ISO Guide 64:2008 provides guidance on addressing environmental issues
    in product standards. It is primarily intended for product standards writers.
    Its purpose is<br />\r\n- to outline the relationship between the provisions in
    product standards and the environmental aspects and impacts of the product,<br
    />\r\n- to assist in drafting or revising provisions in product standards in order
    to reduce potential adverse environmental impacts at different stages of the entire
    product life-cycle,<br />\r\n- to emphasize that taking into account environmental
    issues in product standards is a complex process and requires balancing competing
    priorities,<br />\r\n- to recommend the use of life-cycle thinking when defining
    environmental provisions for a product for which a standard is being drafted,
    and<br />\r\n- to promote the future development of relevant sector guides for
    addressing environmental issues in product standards by standards writers, consistent
    with the principles and approaches of ISO Guide 64:2008.<br />\r\nWhenever a new
    product standard is drafted or an existing product standard is revised or intended
    to be revised, the project managers and their technical committee chairman/convenors
    are encouraged to actively promote the application of this Guide. Furthermore,
    at any stage in the standard development process, experts are encouraged to include
    environmental issues in their comments. In order to take account of the diversity
    of products and their specific environmental impacts, as well as the need for
    relevant environmental knowledge, it is useful for standards writers to involve
    environmental experts in the work. The project managers and their technical committee
    chairman/convenors might wish to take into account other relevant, current sector-specific
    guidance and environmental provisions identified in related standards. Unless
    they are closely related with environmental issues, ISO Guide 64:2008 does not
    address issues of occupational health and safety or consumer safety as separate
    or specific aspects of the product life cycle. Standards writers can find guidance
    on these issues in other guides."
