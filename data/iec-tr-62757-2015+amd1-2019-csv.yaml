  content: IEC TR 62757:2015+A1:2019, which is a technical report, deals with fire
    prevention measures on converters and their valve halls for high voltage direct
    current (HVDC) systems, static VAR compensators (SVC) and flexible AC transmission
    systems (FACTS). It is intended to be primarily for the use of the utilities and
    consultants who are responsible for issuing technical specifications for new converter
    valves and valve halls. It concerns fire incidents in HVDC projects using line
    commutated converters (LCC) or voltage sourced converter (VSC) technology and
    it is from these projects that most examples of fires and fire incidents are taken.
    This technical report also addresses converter valves and valve halls for SVC
    and FACTS. This technical report provides general recommendations to be considered
    while preparing specifications for these systems. Specific requirements for a
    particular project need to be clearly specified and mutually agreed upon between
    the supplier and the purchaser. <strong>This consolidated version consists of
    the first edition (2015) and its amendment 1 (2019). Therefore, no need to order
    amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>
