  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 11770 is concerned with the management of cryptographic keys.
    ISO/IEC 11770-2:2008 specifies a series of 13 mechanisms for establishing shared
    secret keys using symmetric cryptography. These mechanisms address three different
    environments for the establishment of shared secret keys: point-to-point key establishment
    schemes, mechanisms using a Key Distribution Centre (KDC), and techniques that
    use a Key Translation Centre (KTC). ISO/IEC 11770-2:2008 describes the content
    of messages which carry keying material or are necessary to set up the conditions
    under which the keying material can be established. This second edition is a technically
    revised version of the first edition: Mechanism 12 has been modified to address
    identified security shortcomings.</p>"
