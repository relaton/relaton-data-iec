  content: "IEC 62271-112:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62271-112:2021 applies
    to AC high-speed earthing switches (hereinafter termed HSES) designed for indoor
    and outdoor installation and for operation at service frequencies of 50 Hz and
    60 Hz on systems having rated voltages of 550 kV and above. HSESs described in
    this document are intended to extinguish the secondary arc remaining after clearing
    faults on transmission lines by the circuit-breakers. For more detailed information
    on HSESs, refer to Annex A. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition: The document has been updated to the second edition of IEC 62271-1:2017.</p>"
