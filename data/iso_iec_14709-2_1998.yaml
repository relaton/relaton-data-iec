abstract:
- content: This standard specifies Customer Premises Cabling for the connection of
    customer premises equipment with 1,544 Mbit/s and 2,048 Mbit/s interfaces to ISDN
    primary access and leased lines. The requirements in this standard are derived
    from ITU-T I.431 (Blue Book, Volume III) and contain additional requirements as
    well as modifications of ITU-T I.431 and IEC 60603-7. This part of ISO/IEC 14709
    is intended for use by those designing, planning, procuring, installing or testing
    cabling for ISDN primary access within a customer's premises. The design requirements
    are specified in clause 5; the minimum requirements for the associated components
    are specified in clause 7. In addition, guidance is given for the use of generic
    cabling in accordance with ISO/IEC 11801.
