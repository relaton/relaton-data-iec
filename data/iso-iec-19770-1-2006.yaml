    <p>ISO/IEC 19770-1:2006 has been developed to enable an organization to prove that it is performing software asset management (SAM) to a standard sufficient to satisfy corporate governance requirements and ensure effective support for IT service management overall. ISO/IEC 19770-1:2006 is intended to align closely to, and to support, ISO/IEC 20000. Good practice in SAM should result in several benefits, and certifiable good practice should allow management and other organizations to place reliance on the adequacy of these processes. The expected benefits should be achieved with a high degree of confidence: </p>
    <p>SAM should facilitate the management of business risks, cost control and give competitive advantages.</p>
