abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    25434:2008 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120
    mm recordable optical disks with capacities of 8,55 Gbytes and 17,1 Gbytes. It
    specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the
    data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by
    means of such disks. The data can be written once and read many times using a
    non-reversible method. These disks are identified as +R DL.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 25434:2008
    also specifies 80 mm disks with capacities of 2,66 Gbytes and 5,32 Gbytes. These
    disks have the same characteristics as the 120 mm disks, except for some parameters
    related to the smaller dimensions. All parameters unique for the 80 mm disks are
    specified in an annex.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 25434:2008 specifies the following:<br
    />\r\ntwo related but different Types of this disk;<br />\r\nthe conditions for
    conformance;<br />\r\nthe environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated
    and stored;<br />\r\nthe mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics
    of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;<br
    />\r\nthe format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition
    of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method;<br
    />\r\nthe characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data
    processing systems to read the data from the disk.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 25434:2008
    provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with
    a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems."
