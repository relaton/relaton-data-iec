abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 25434:2008 specifies the
    mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120 mm recordable optical
    disks with capacities of 8,55 Gbytes and 17,1 Gbytes. It specifies the quality
    of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of the data and the recording
    method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. The
    data can be written once and read many times using a non-reversible method. These
    disks are identified as +R DL.</p><p>ISO/IEC 25434:2008 also specifies 80 mm disks
    with capacities of 2,66 Gbytes and 5,32 Gbytes. These disks have the same characteristics
    as the 120 mm disks, except for some parameters related to the smaller dimensions.
    All parameters unique for the 80 mm disks are specified in an annex.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    25434:2008 specifies the following:</p><ul><li>two related but different Types
    of this disk;</li><li>the conditions for conformance;</li><li>the environments
    in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored;</li><li>the mechanical,
    physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical
    interchange between data processing systems;</li><li>the format of the information
    on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the
    error correcting codes and the coding method;</li><li>the characteristics of the
    signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to read the
    data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 25434:2008 provides for the interchange
    of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and
    file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing
    systems.</p>
