  content: "IEC 62087-2:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62087-2:2023
    specifies the signals used to determine the power consumption of audio, video,
    and related equipment, such as television sets and computer monitors. It also
    specifies signals for determining the peak luminance ratio that is sometimes associated
    with television set power consumption measurement programs. In addition, this
    part specifies equipment, interfaces, and accuracy related to signal generation.
    IEC 62087-2:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    HDR and UHD video test signals have been added;<br />\r\nb) dynamic box and outline
    test signals have been added, replacing the static box and outline test signals;<br
    />\r\nc) all test signals are provided as media files for download from a specified
    IEC online repository, which replaces previous DVD and Blu-ray media."
