abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-73:2018+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular aluminium winding wire of class 200 with a dual coating. The underlying
    coating is based on polyester or polyesterimide resin, which can be modified providing
    it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all specified
    wire requirements. The superimposed coating is based on polyamide-imide resin.
    NOTE A modified resin is a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains
    one or more additives to enhance certain performance or application characteristics.
    The range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this standard is:<br />\r\n-
    width: min. 2,0 mm - max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm - max. 5,60
    mm.<br />\r\nWires of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this specification and
    apply to the complete range of conductors. The specified combinations of width
    and thickness as well as the specified width/thickness ratio are given in IEC
    60317-0-9:2015.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords: insulated wires used for windings"
