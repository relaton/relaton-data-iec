abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 16480:2015 specifies a method to assess the symbol quality rendered
    on electronic displays (i.e. the symbol produces its own light) when the reading
    device is a two-dimensional bar code imager.<p>In addition, this international
    standard specifies a method to assess the quality of symbols that are intended
    to be read with general-purpose cameras in ambient lighting conditions.</p><p>Further,
    this international standard describes modifications, which are to be considered
    in conjunction with the symbol quality methodology when applied to a particular
    symbology specification as defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and ISO/IEC 15416. It defines
    alternative illumination conditions, display pixel conditions and the reporting
    of the grading results. This document also describes appropriate ranges of symbol
    X-dimensions.</p>
