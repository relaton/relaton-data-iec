abstract:
- content: "The ISO/IEC 23091 series defines various systems code points and fields
    that establish properties of a multimedia stream that are independent of the compression
    encoding and bit rate. These properties could describe the appropriate interpretation
    of decoded multimedia data or could, similarly, describe the characteristics of
    such signals before the signal is compressed by an encoder that is suitable for
    compressing such an input signal.<br />\r\nNOTE ISO/IEC 23091-1:2018 specifies
    a URN format applicable to code points from any part of the ISO/IEC 23091 series,
    and could be revised in future to contain code points specific to multimedia systems
    (in contrast to video and audio)."
