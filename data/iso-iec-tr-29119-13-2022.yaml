    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>—    gives information for software testers for the systematic, risk-based testing of biometric systems and larger systems which include biometric subsystems;</p>
    <p>—    establishes the importance of both biometric standards and software testing standards and provides overviews of both areas and their standardization;</p>
    <p>—    specifies the most important biometric standards for software testers of biometric systems;</p>
    <p>—    provides information for software testers who wish to conform to both the relevant biometrics standards and the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards by providing mappings between the two sets of standards;</p>
    <p>—    is not limited to the testing of the technical performance of biometric systems in terms of error rates and throughput rates, but instead covers the testing of the full range of relevant quality characteristics, such as reliability, availability, maintainability, security, conformance, usability, human factors, and privacy regulation compliance;</p>
    <p>—    gives information on applying a risk-based testing approach to the testing of biometric systems that covers the full range of product and project risks;</p>
    <p>—    provides testers with an example set of product and project risks associated with biometric systems along with suggestions on how these risks can be treated as part of a risk-based approach to the testing;</p>
    <p>—    includes mappings between the documentation requirements of ISO/IEC 19795-1, ISO/IEC 19795-2 and ISO/IEC 19795-6 and the software test documentation defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3.</p>
