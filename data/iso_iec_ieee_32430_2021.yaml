abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a method for the sizing of non-functional software
    requirements. It complements ISO/ IEC 20926:2009, which defines a method for the
    sizing of functional user requirements (FUR).1</p><p>This document also describes
    the complementarity of functional and non-functional sizes, so that sizing both
    functional and non-functional requirements (NFR) do not overlap. It also describes
    how non-functional size, together with functional size, should be used for measuring
    the performance of software projects, setting benchmarks, and estimating the cost
    and duration of software projects.</p><p>In general, there are many types of non-functional
    software requirements. Moreover, non-functional aspects evolve over time and may
    include additional aspects in the as technology advances. This standard does not
    intend to define the type of NFR for a given context. Users may choose ISO 25010:2011
    or any other standard for the definition of NFR. It is assumed that users will
    size the NFR based on the definitions they use.</p><p>This document covers a subset
    of non-functional types. It is expected that, with time, the state of the art
    can improve and that potential future versions of this standard can define an
    extended coverage. The ultimate goal is a version that, together with ISO/IEC
    20926:2009, covers every aspect that may be required of any prospective piece
    of software, including aspects such as process and project directives that are
    hard or impossible to trace to the software's algorithm or data. The combination
    of functional and non-functional size would then correspond to the total size
    necessary to bring the software into existence.</p><p>Calculating the effort and
    duration of the implementation of the NFR is outside the scope of this standard.</p>"
