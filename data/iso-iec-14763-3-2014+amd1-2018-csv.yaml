    and testing of installed optical fibre cabling designed in accordance with premises
    cabling standards including ISO/IEC 11801, ISO/IEC 24764, ISO/IEC 24702 and ISO/IEC
    15018. The test methods refer to existing standards-based procedures where they
    exist. This second edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following changes:<br />\r\n- general requirements have been revised;<br />\r\n-
    OTDR characterization (6.2) and requirements for cabling interface adapters and
    test cords have been revised;<br />\r\n- enhanced three-test-cord reference method
    has been introduced;<br />\r\n- information on optical time domain reflectometry
    (Annex C) has been revised;<br />\r\n- examples of calculations of channel and
    permanent link limits (Annex G) have been revised and information regarding cleaning
    and inspection of fibre optic connections have been added (Annex H). This consolidated
    version consists of the second edition (2014) and its corrigendum (2015), and
    its amendment 1 (2018). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
