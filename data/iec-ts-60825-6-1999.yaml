    The objectives of this technical specification are:

    - to protect persons from optical radiation arising from products incorporating visible diode emitter sources, such as displays, indicators, electronic signs and signals;

    - to lay down requirements for manufacturers and installers, in order that procedures can be established and information supplied to enable correct precautions to be taken;

    - to ensure adequate warning of hazards associated with accessible optical radiation from visible sources;

    - to reduce the potential for injury by minimizing unnecessary optical radiation, to give improved control of optical radiation through protective features, and to provide safe usage of products by specifying user control measures.
