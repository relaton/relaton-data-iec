    <p>ISO/IEC 16317:2011 specifies maintenance of network connectivity and presence by proxies to extend the sleep duration of hosts.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 16317:2011 specifies:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>capabilities that a proxy may expose to a host;</li>
    <li>information that must be exchanged between a host and a proxy;</li>
    <li>proxy behaviour for 802.3 (Ethernet) and 802.11 (WiFi);</li>
    <li>required and optional behaviour of a proxy while it is operating, including responding to packets, generating packets, ignoring packets, and waking the host.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 16317:2011 does not:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>specify communication mechanisms between hosts and proxies;</li>
    <li>extend or modify the referenced specifications (and for any discrepancies those specifications are authoritative);</li>
    <li>support security and communication protocols such as IPsec, MACSec, SSL, TLS, Mobile IP, etc.</li>
