abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-030:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-030:2017
    This group safety publication is primarily intended to be used as a product safety
    standard for the products mentioned in the scope, but shall also be used by technical
    committees in the preparation of their publications for products similar to those
    mentioned in the scope of this standard, in accordance with the principles laid
    down in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-030:2017 specifies
    safety requirements for equipment having testing or measuring circuits which are
    connected for test or measurement purposes to devices or circuits outside the
    measurement equipment itself.<br />\r\nThese include measuring circuits which
    are part of electrical test and measurement equipment, laboratory equipment, or
    process control equipment. The existence of these circuits in equipment requires
    additional protective means between the circuit and an OPERATOR.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tReference
    to IEC 61010-031 for probe assemblies and IEC 61010-032 for current sensors has
    been added.\r\n\tIndirect bonding for testing and measuring circuits has been
    modified, in particular to take into account the duration of current flow versus
    body current for a.c. and d.c. currents according to IEC TS 60479-1 and IEC TS
    60479-2.\r\n\tClearance and creepage distance for wet locations and for measuring
    circuit terminal exceeding 1 000 V a.c. or d.c have been specified.\r\n\tThe voltage
    source for testing overvoltage limiting component or circuit may be limited to
    400 V.\r\n\tRequirements against transient overvoltages for mains voltage measuring
    circuits have been added.\r\n\tRequirements for measuring circuits from 1 000
    V d.c. to 1 500 V d.c. have been added.\r\n\tThe corrigendum has been included
    in Tables K.102 to K.104.\r\n\tRequirements for reduction of transient overvoltages
    have been modified.\r\n\tAn informative Annex CC about the dimensions of banana
    terminals has been added.\r\n\tFlowchart for insulation according to the type
    of circuit has been added in a new Annex DD.\r\n\r\nIt has the status of a group
    safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
