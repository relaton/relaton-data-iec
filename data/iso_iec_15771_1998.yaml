abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the additional network feature Common Information
    (ANF-CMN), which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private
    Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br
    />\r\nANF-CMN is an additional network feature which enables the exchange of Common
    Information between entities acting on behalf of the two ends of a connection
    through a PISN. This Common Information is a collection of miscellaneous information
    that relates to the user or equipment at one end of a connection and includes
    one or more of the following: Feature Identifiers, Party Category, Equipment Identity.
    This information, when received by an entity, can be used for any purpose, e.g.
    as the basis for indications to the local user or to another network or in order
    to filter feature requests.<br />\r\nAdditional network feature specifications
    are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ITU-T Rec.
    I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of ANF-CMN. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the additional network
    feature as seen by users of the feature. The stage 2 specification (clause 7)
    identifies the functional entities involved in the additional network feature
    and the information flows between them."
