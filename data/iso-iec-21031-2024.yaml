  content: "<p>This document describes a methodology for calculating the rate of carbon
    emissions for a software system; that is, its SCI score. The purpose of this score
    is to increase awareness and transparency of an application's sustainability credentials.
    The score will help software practitioners make better, evidence-based decisions
    during system design, development, and deployment, that will ultimately minimize
    carbon emissions. A reliable, consistent, fair and comparable measure allows targets
    to be defined during development and progress to be tracked.</p>"
