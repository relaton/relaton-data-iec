  content: Proposes comparative tests that could be particularly useful for project
    implementers to test in laboratories of developing countries the capability of
    products to be used for their project. The tests can be performed locally, as
    close as possible of the real site operating conditions. Additionally gives some
    recommendations in order to enhance the performances or effectiveness of the lighting
    sources using a luminaire.
