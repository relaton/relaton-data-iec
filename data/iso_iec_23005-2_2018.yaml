abstract:
- content: "<p>The technologies of this document specified are:</p><p>— description
    languages and vocabularies to characterize devices and users;</p><p>— control
    information to fine tune the sensed information and the actuator command for the
    control of virtual/real worlds, i.e., user's actuation preference information,
    user's sensor preference information, actuator capability description, and sensor
    capability description</p><p>The adaptation engine is not within the scope of
    this document.</p><p>This document specifies syntax and semantics of the tools
    required to provide interoperability in controlling devices (actuators and sensors)
    in real as well as virtual worlds:</p><p>— Control Information Description Language
    (CIDL) as an XML schema-based language which enables one to describe a basic structure
    of control information.</p><p>— Device Capability Description Vocabulary (DCDV),
    an XML representation for describing capabilities of actuators such as lamps,
    fans, vibrators, motion chairs, scent generators, etc.</p><p>— Sensor Capability
    Description Vocabulary (SCDV), interfaces for describing capabilities of sensors
    such as a light sensor, a temperature sensor, a velocity sensor, a global position
    sensor, an intelligent camera sensor, etc.</p><p>— Sensory Effect Preference Vocabulary
    (SEPV), interfaces for describing preferences of individual user on specific sensorial
    effects such as light, wind, scent, vibration, etc.</p><p>— Sensor Adaptation
    Preference Vocabulary (SAPV), interfaces for describing preferences on a sensor
    of an individual user on each type of sensed information.</p>"
