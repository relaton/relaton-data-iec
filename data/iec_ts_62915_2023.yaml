abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62915:2023 sets forth a uniform approach to maintain type approval,
    design and safety qualification of terrestrial PV modules that have undergone
    or will undergo modification from their originally assessed design. This document
    addresses two types of PV module technologies, wafer-based technologies (WBT)
    and monolithically-integrated (MLI) thin-film based technologies.<br />\r\nThis
    document lists typical modifications and the resulting requirements for retesting
    based on the different test standards. It provides assistance; at some level,
    engineering judgement may be needed.<br />\r\nThis publication contains attached
    files in the form of xls document. These files are intended to be used as a complement
    and do not form an integral part of the publication.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2018. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- Prior references to specific process-related changes to PV modules have
    been removed in this edition and replaced with a general requirement to ensure
    that a consistent quality management system is in place per IEC 62941<br />\r\n-
    References to IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 have been updated to the latest editions
    (2021 and 2023 respectively)<br />\r\n- Retest requirements with respect to new
    added tests such as cyclic (dynamic) mechanical load (MQT 20) and potential-induced
    degradation (MQT 21) are addressed in this edition<br />\r\n- Retest requirements
    for IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 have been separated for the sake of clarity<br />\r\n-
    A comprehensive matrix table summarizing all the retest requirements for each
    possible change in material(s) or design modification is provided in this edition<br
    />\r\n- References to component level standards, namely IEC 62788-1 series and
    IEC 62788-2 series, are included in this edition to address changes that could
    be made to the critical sub-components going into new PV module constructions<br
    />\r\n- Crystalline silicon and thin film references have been updated to be consistent
    with nomenclature in the updated IEC 61215 and IEC 61730 standards; namely, wafer-based
    technology (WBT) and monolithically integrated (MLI) thin film PV modules<br />\r\n-
    In this edition, 4.3 which addresses retest requirements for MLI thin film PV
    modules has been truncated and simplified by removing redundant sections that
    are identical with the subclauses in 4.2<br />\r\nGuidance for retesting modules
    according to IEC TS 63126, “Guidelines for qualifying PV modules, components and
    materials for operation at high temperatures” has been added to this edition.<br
    />\r\n- In this edition, requirements have been added for changes affecting system
    compatibility with variants of the same model"
