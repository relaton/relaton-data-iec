    <p>ISO/IEC 15433:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Wireless Terminal Authentication supplementary services (SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p>
    <p>Authentication of a WTM user (SS-WTAT) is a supplementary service that enables a PISN, as a security measure, to validate the identity provided by the WTM user.</p>
    <p>Authentication of the PISN (SS-WTAN) is a supplementary service that enables a served WTM user, as a security measure, to validate the identity of the PISN.</p>
    <p>The mechanisms used in these services are based on the challenge and response method of authentication.</p>
    <p>Authentication algorithms to be used by these supplementary services are outside the scope of this International Standard.</p>
    <p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p>
    <p>Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15432.</p>
    <p>The signalling protocol for SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15433:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-WTAT / SS-WTAN and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15433:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>
