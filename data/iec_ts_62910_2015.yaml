abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62910:2015(E) provides a test procedure for evaluating the performance
    of Low Voltage Ride-Through (LVRT) functions in inverters used in utility-interconnected
    PV systems. The technical specification is most applicable to large systems where
    PV inverters are connected to utility HV distribution systems. However, the applicable
    procedures may also be used for LV installations in locations where evolving LVRT
    requirements include such installations, e.g. single-phase or 3-phase systems.
    The measurement procedures are designed to be as non-site-specific as possible,
    so that LVRT characteristics measured at one test site, for example, can also
    be considered valid at other sites. This technical specification is for testing
    of PV inverters, though it contains information that may also be useful for testing
    of a complete PV power plant consisting of multiple inverters connected at a single
    point to the utility grid. It further provides a basis for utility-interconnected
    PV inverter numerical simulation and model validation.
