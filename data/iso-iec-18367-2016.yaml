    <p>ISO/IEC 18367:2016 gives guidelines for cryptographic algorithms and security mechanisms conformance testing methods.</p>
    <p>Conformance testing assures that an implementation of a cryptographic algorithm or security mechanism is correct whether implemented in hardware, software or firmware. It also confirms that it runs correctly in a specific operating environment. Testing can consist of known-answer or Monte Carlo testing, or a combination of test methods. Testing can be performed on the actual implementation or modelled in a simulation environment.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18367:2016 does not include the efficiency of the algorithms or security mechanisms nor the intrinsic performance. This document focuses on the correctness of the implementation.</p>
