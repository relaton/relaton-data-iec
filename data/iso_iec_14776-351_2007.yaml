abstract:
- content: The SCSI command set provides efficient peer-to-peer operation of input&#x2F;output
    devices (disks, tapes, printers, etc.) by an operating system. This International
    Standard defines the SCSI commands and model for indepedent medium changer devices
    and attached medium changer functions integrated into other SCSI devices. This
    includes the commands and external behavioural characteristics of a device server,
    and the behaviour of the attached medium changer commands (SMC).
