abstract:
- content: "This document (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission
    rates of analyte from ICT & CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission
    Test Chamber (ETC). This document (all parts) includes specific methods for equipment
    using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such
    as monitors and PCs.<br /><br />\r\nPart 1 specifies the methods to determine
    chemical emission rates of analyte from electronic equipment using consumables.
    The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC,
    storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates. Emission rates
    from EUT may also be determined according to additional requirements identified
    by \"RALâ€‘UZ 205 Option\". Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns
    for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables. The operational readiness
    of AMS is confirmed according to Annex B. Calculations use the generalised model
    and approximations thereof as developed in Annex C. The emission rates determined
    with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same class. Predictions
    of \"real indoor\" concentrations from the determined emission rates are outside
    the scope of this document."
