abstract:
- content: <p>This document (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission
    rates of analyte from ICT &amp; CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission
    Test Chamber (ETC).</p><p>This document (all parts) includes specific methods
    for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables,
    such as monitors and PC's.</p><p>Part 1 specifies the methods to determine chemical
    emission rates of analyte from electronic equipment using consumables.</p><p>The
    methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage
    and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p><p>Emission rates
    from EUT may also be determined according to additional requirements identified
    by "RALâ€‘UZ 205 Option".</p><p>Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns
    for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables.</p><p>The operational
    readiness of AMS is confirmed according to Annex B.</p><p>Calculations use the
    generalised model and approximations thereof as developed in Annex C.</p><p>The
    emission rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in
    the same class.</p><p>Predictions of "real indoor" concentrations from the determined
    emission rates are outside the scope of this document.</p>
