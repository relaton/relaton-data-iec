abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 61182-2:2014(E) specifies the XML schema that represents the intelligent
    data file format used to describe printed board and printed board assembly products
    with details sufficient for tooling, manufacturing, assembly, and inspection requirements.
    This format may be used for transmitting information between a printed board designer
    and a manufacturing or assembly facility. The data is most useful when the manufacturing
    cycle includes computer-aided processes and numerical control machines.
