abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15444-10:2008 defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy
    compression methods for coding continuous-tone, bi-level, grey-scale, colour digital
    volumetric images, or multi-component volumetric images. This set of methods extends
    the elements in the core coding system defined in ISO/IEC 15444-1 and ISO/IEC
    15444-2. Extensions which pertain to encoding and decoding are defined as procedures
    which may be used in combination with the encoding and decoding processes defined
    in ISO/IEC 15444-1 and ISO/IEC 15444-2. Each encoding or decoding extension is
    to be used only in combination with particular coding processes and only in accordance
    with the requirements set forth herein. ISO/IEC 15444-10:2008 also defines extensions
    to the compressed data format, i.e. interchange format and the abbreviated formats.In
    particular, for ISO/IEC 15444-2, the following extensions are supported by ISO/IEC
    15444-10:2008:variable DC offset;arbitrary wavelet transform kernels;multi-component
    transformations;non-linear transformations;region-of-interest.
