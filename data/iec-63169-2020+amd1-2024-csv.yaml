  content: IEC 63169:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV deals with a test to simulate the weight loss
    of leafy produce, given certain conditions of temperature, humidity and air movement
    in one or more test zones. The test can only be applied to spaces larger than
    200 mm × 150 mm ×100 mm (L × W × H). The aim of the test is to measure the weight
    loss rate by measuring the weight of a test tray prior to the test and after a
    given duration. Weight loss is one of the considerations for shelf life of produce.
    Other considerations such as condensation will be addressed in future amendments.
