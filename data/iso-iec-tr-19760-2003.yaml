    <p>ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 is a Technical Report that provides guidance for application of the International Standard ISO/IEC 15288 <i>Systems Engineering - System life cycle processes</i> in regard to systems and projects irrespective of size and type. ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 can be used as a companion document to the International Standard by those who: </p>
    <ol><li>apply the International Standard within their organization;</li><li>use the International Standard in regard to a specific system;</li><li>prepare organizational and domain specific standards based on the International Standard.</li></ol>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 elaborates on factors that should be considered when applying the International Standard. It does this in the context of the various ways in which ISO/IEC 15288 may be applied. ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 provides example application concerns lists for user consideration. However, ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 is not intended to provide <i>how-to</i> guidance for each application area of the International Standard.</p>
    <p>Guidance is provided for appropriate tailoring of the International Standard for application to specific systems or projects.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 19760:2003 also provides appropriate links to other ISO documents for supporting application of the International Standard and to aid in assessing the effectiveness of the application of the International Standard.</p>
