abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 62883:2014(E) specifies a framework for adaptive handling of explicit
    interaction among humans and AAL spaces. This is based on a differentiation between
    explicit and implicit interaction as a consequence of the paradigm shift from
    Human-Computer Interaction to Human-Environment Interaction, further explained
    in the definition of the latter term. As a framework, a main subject matter of
    the specification is the identification of relevant areas for further standardization,
    thereby also looking at the interrelationships among the identified areas. The
    PAS also provides a first extensible specification in some of those areas.
