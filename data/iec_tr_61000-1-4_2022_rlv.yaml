abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-1-4:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 61000-1-4:2022
    which is a technical report, reviews the sources and effects of power frequency
    conducted harmonic current emissions in the frequency range up to 2 kHz on the
    public electricity supply, and gives an account of the reasoning and calculations
    leading to the existing emission limits for equipment in the editions of IEC 61000-3-2,
    up to and including the fifth edition (2018) with Amendment 1 (2020), and in the
    second edition of IEC 61000-3-12. The history is traced from the first supra-national
    standard on low-frequency conducted emissions into the public electricity supply,
    EN 50006:1975 and its evolution through IEC (60)555-2 to IEC 61000-3-2, IEC TR
    61000-3-4 and IEC 61000-3-12. To give a full picture of the history, that of the
    standard for the measuring instrument IEC 61000-4-7 is mentioned as well. NOTE
    All IEC standards were renumbered starting from 60000 from 1998-01-01. To indicate
    the references of standards withdrawn before, or not reprinted after, that date,
    the “60x” prefix is here enclosed in parentheses. Hence “IEC (60)555-2”. Some
    concepts in this document apply to all low voltage AC systems, but the numerical
    values apply specifically to the European 230 V/400 V 50 Hz system. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2005. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- relation between
    compatibility levels, emission limits and immunity requirements clarified;<br
    />\r\n- sharing of emission levels between LV, MV and HV clarified;<br />\r\n-
    new historical information added."
