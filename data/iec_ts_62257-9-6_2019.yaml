abstract:
- content: "IEC 62257-9-6:2019 proposes a simple selection procedure and cheap, comparative
    tests which can be performed in laboratories of developing countries, in order
    to identify the most suitable model of small Photovoltaic Individual Electrification
    Systems (PV- IES) up to 500 Wp for a particular rural electrification project
    from a number of products submitted for test. The tests provided in IEC TS 62257-9-6
    allow assessment of the performance of a PV-IES according to the requirement of
    the general specification of the project (see IEC/TS 62257-2) and to verify their
    ability to provide the required service. This second edition of IEC TS 62257-9-6
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008. The main technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- Removal of the
    term \"small\" from the title of the publication and from description of rural
    electrification systems.<br />\r\n- Removal of the limits on system voltage and
    power; these recommendations apply to systems of all sizes."
