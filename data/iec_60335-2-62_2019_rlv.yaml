abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-62:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60335-2-62:2019 deals with
    the safety of electrically operated commercial rinsing sinks used in commercial
    kitchens, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    connected between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances. These
    appliances are used for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens, hospitals
    and commercial enterprises such as bakeries, butcheries, etc. The electrical part
    of appliances making use of other forms of energy is also within the scope of
    this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards
    presented by these types of appliances. Attention is drawn to the fact that:<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in tropical countries, special requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances designed primarily for sterilizing to
    clinical standards;<br />\r\n- dishwashers (IEC 60335-2-58);<br />\r\n- appliances
    designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to
    be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of
    a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2002 and its Amendment
    1:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- indicates specific values for temperatures for accessible parts and water
    and aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Edition 5, and its Amendments 1 and 2;<br
    />\r\n- requires the application of test probe 12 for the verification of access
    to live parts (8.101);<br />\r\n- foresees the use of a specific test probe for
    the measurements of temperatures of accessible surfaces (11.3);<br />\r\n- washing
    vessel (11.8);<br />\r\n- modification on leakage current defining the value for
    appliances with a power consumption less than 1 kW (13.2);<br />\r\n- addition
    of specific requirements concerning types of screws to be used for electrical
    connections and connections for earth continuity (Clause 28);<br />\r\n- addition
    of informative Annex P dealing with leakage currents for appliances used in tropical
    climates.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis of the fifth
    edition (2010) of that standard.</p>"
