abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC TR 15446:2004 provides guidance relating to the construction
    of Protection Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets (STs) that are intended to be
    compliant with ISO/IEC 15408 (the "Common Criteria").</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 15446:2004
    gives suggestions on how to develop each section of a PP or ST. It is supported
    by an annex that contains generic examples of each type of PP and ST component,
    and by other annexes that contain detailed worked examples.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 15446:2004
    is primarily aimed at those who are involved in the development of PPs and STs.
    However, it is also likely to be useful to evaluators of PPs and STs and to those
    who are responsible for monitoring PP and ST evaluation. It may also be of interest
    to consumers and users of PPs and STs who wish to understand what guidance the
    PP/ST author used, and which parts of the PP or ST are of principal interest.</p>
