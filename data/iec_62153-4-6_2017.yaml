abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC 62153-4-6:2017 is available as IEC 62153-4-6:2017 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    62153-4-6:2017 determines the screening effectiveness of a shielded metallic communication
    cable by applying a well-defined current and voltage to the screen of the cable
    and measuring the induced voltage in order to determine the surface transfer impedance.<br
    />\r\nMeasurements in the frequency range from a few kHz up to and above 1 GHz
    can be made with the use of normal high frequency instrumentation."
