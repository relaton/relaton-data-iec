abstract:
- content: ISO TS 23302:2021 This document specifies requirements and recommendations
    for the identification of measurands to characterize nano-objects and their agglomerates
    and aggregates, and to assess specific properties relevant to the performance
    of materials that contain them. It provides recommendations for relevant measurement.
