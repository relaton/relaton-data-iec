    <p>ISO/IEC/TS 20013:2015 details a reference framework of e-Portfolio implementation that can be used to inform and support development of ITLET systems that meet the requirements of learners, instructors, e-learning service providers and others in contexts such as K-12 education, higher education, training and development.</p>
    <p>The reference framework identifies content and functional components that support e-Portfolio systems and interoperability issues that need to be addressed in data exchange between these components and interoperability issues that need to be addressed in data exchange between the two component types (content and functional) and among the various categories.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC/TS 20013:2015: provides an e-Portfolio reference framework; provides descriptions of e-Portfolios in terms of components, categories, and elements; provides descriptions of e-Portfolios in terms of component types (content or functional), categories, elements, and items; identifies commonalities of current implementations of e-Portfolios; and represents the needs of stakeholders (e.g. learners, instructors, etc.).</p>
    <p>The scope of ISO/IECTS 20013:2015 does not include: in-depth technical review of issues related to adaptability to culture, language, and human functions; security techniques related to the protection of privacy information; authentication of the identity of an IT or ITLET system user; how e-Portfolios might integrate with ITLET systems; and specific requirements of e-Portfolios or e-Portfolio systems to meet jurisdictional domain requirements.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC/TS 20013:2015 currently does not address: aspects of accessibility; the elements required of learner and instructor; best practices of e-portfolio use cases in the fields on K-12 education, higher education and training; guides to support the use of e-Portfolios in learning, education, and training environments; and detailed technical information regarding specific types of e-portfolios (e.g. learning, teaching, assessment, presentation, personal development, career, course, program, institutional, or other).</p>
    <p>It is anticipated that some or all of these requirements may be addressed in future editions of ISO/IEC/TS 20013, or in companion International Standards or Technical Reports.</p>
