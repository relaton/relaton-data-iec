abstract:
- content: "IEC 60352-4:2020 is applicable to non-accessible ID connections for which
    the tests and measurements according to Clauses 6 through 8 are suitable and which
    are made with:\r\n– appropriately designed ID terminations;\r\n– wires having
    solid round conductors of 0,25 mm to 3,6 mm nominal diameter;\r\n– wires having
    stranded conductors of 0,05 mm2 to 10 mm2 cross-sectional area;\r\nfor use in
    electrical and electronic equipment and components.\r\nInformation on materials
    and data from industrial experience is included in addition to the test procedures
    to provide electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental conditions.\r\nThere
    are different designs and materials for ID terminations in use. For this reason,
    only fundamental parameters of the termination are specified, while the performance
    requirements of the wire and the complete connection are specified in full detail.\r\nThe
    purpose of this document is:\r\n– to determine the suitability of non-accessible
    ID connections under specified mechanical, electrical and atmospheric conditions;\r\n–
    to provide a means of comparing test results when the tools used to make the connections,
    if any, are of different designs or manufacture.\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition, published in 1994, and its Amendment 1 (2000).
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\na) Transferred
    Clauses 9 to 13 into Annex A (informative).\r\nb) The figures were re-drawn for
    clarity."
