  content: "IEC 60216-6:2022 specifies the experimental and calculation procedures
    for deriving the thermal endurance characteristics, temperature index (TI) and
    relative temperature index (RTI) of an electrical insulating material (EIM) using
    the “fixed time frame method (FTFM)”. In this protocol, the ageing takes place
    for a small number of fixed times, using the appro­priate number of ageing temperatures
    throughout each time, the properties of the specimens being measured at the end
    of the relevant time interval. This differs from the procedure of IEC 60216-1,
    where ageing is conducted at a small number of fixed temperatures, property measurement
    taking place after ageing times dependent on the progress of ageing. The diagnostic
    tests employed in the fixed time frame method are restricted to destructive tests.
    The method has not yet been applied to non-destructive or proof test procedures.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- clarification of definition of index properties
    vs. endurance properties;<br />\r\n- complete rework of Annex G and the corresponding
    program."
