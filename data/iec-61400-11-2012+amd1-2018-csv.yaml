  content: "IEC 61400-11:2012+A1:2018 presents measurement procedures that enable
    noise emissions of a wind turbine to be characterised. This involves using measurement
    methods appropriate to noise emission assessment at locations close to the machine,
    in order to avoid errors due to sound propagation, but far away enough to allow
    for the finite source size. The procedures described are different in some respects
    from those that would be adopted for noise assessment in community noise studies.
    They are intended to facilitate characterisation of wind turbine noise with respect
    to a range of wind speeds and directions. Standardisation of measurement procedures
    will also facilitate comparisons between different wind turbines. This new edition
    constitutes a technical revision, introducing new principles for data reduction
    procedures. <strong>This consolidated version consists of the third edition (2012)
    and its amendment 1 (2018). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition
    to this publication.</strong><br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of October
    2019 have been included in this copy."
