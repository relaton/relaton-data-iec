  content: IEC TR 62878-2-8:2021(E) describes a warpage control of active device embedded
    substrate along with parameters for determining warpage, which are useful during
    package assembly. Warpage results are explained using warpage driving force, resistance
    and neutral axis, for typical die embedded substrate, where the discrete active
    dies are placed in the core of substrate and interconnected to the substrate by
    direct Cu bonding. The same principles are applicable in other device embedded
    substrates. Even though the detailed structure of other device embedded substrates
    might be different, the origin and determination of the parameters of warpage
    are the same and thus the purpose of this report is to help engineers improve
    the warpage behaviours of their products by applying this principle.
