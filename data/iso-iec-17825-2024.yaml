    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies the non-invasive attack mitigation test metrics for determining conformance to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 for security levels 3 and 4. The test metrics are associated with the security functions addressed in ISO/IEC 19790:2012. Testing is conducted at the defined boundary of the cryptographic module and the inputs/outputs available at its defined boundary.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 24759:2017 to demonstrate conformance to ISO/IEC 19790:2012. </span></p>
    <p class="Note"><span lang="EN-GB">NOTE<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">            </span>ISO/IEC 24759:2017 specifies the test methods used by testing laboratories to assess whether the cryptographic module conforms to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 and the test metrics specified in this document for each of the associated security functions addressed in ISO/IEC 19790:2012.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">The test approach employed in this document is an efficient “push-button” approach, i.e. the tests are technically sound, repeatable and have moderate costs.</span></p>
