abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29102:2011 provides a method to determine the ink cartridge photo
    yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink cartridges
    without integrated print heads) for colour photo printing with colour inkjet printers
    and multi-function devices that contain inkjet printer components. Ink cartridge
    yields determined on one printer model, paper and cartridge configuration are
    not applicable to another printer model or cartridge configuration even if the
    ink jet cartridges used in testing are the same.It prescribes the following:the
    test method that manufacturers, test labs, etc. use to determine ink cartridge
    photo yield;the method for determination of declared photo yield values from the
    test results; andthe appropriate method of describing the photo yield of cartridges
    in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer.
