abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29102:2011 provides a method to determine the ink cartridge
    photo yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink
    cartridges without integrated print heads) for colour photo printing with colour
    inkjet printers and multi-function devices that contain inkjet printer components.
    Ink cartridge yields determined on one printer model, paper and cartridge configuration
    are not applicable to another printer model or cartridge configuration even if
    the ink jet cartridges used in testing are the same.</p><p>It prescribes the following:</p><ul><li>the
    test method that manufacturers, test labs, etc. use to determine ink cartridge
    photo yield;</li><li>the method for determination of declared photo yield values
    from the test results; and</li><li>the appropriate method of describing the photo
    yield of cartridges in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer.</li></ul>"
