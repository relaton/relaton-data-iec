abstract:
- content: "IEC 62396-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62396-1:2016(E)
    provides guidance on atmospheric radiation effects on avionics electronics used
    in aircraft operating at altitudes up to 60 000 ft (18,3 km). It defines the radiation
    environment, the effects of that environment on electronics and provides design
    considerations for the accommodation of those effects within avionics systems.
    This International Standard helps aerospace equipment manufacturers and designers
    to standardise their approach to single event effects in avionics by providing
    guidance, leading to a standard methodology. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    incorporation of references to some new papers and issues which have appeared
    since 2011;<br />\r\n- addition of solar flares and extreme space weather reference
    to a proposed future Part 6;<br />\r\n- addition of reference to a proposed new
    Part 7 on incorporating atmospheric radiation effects analysis into the system
    design process;<br />\r\n- addition of a reference to a proposed future Part 8
    on other particles including protons, pions and muons."
