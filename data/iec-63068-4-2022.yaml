  content: IEC 63068-4:2022(E) provides a procedure for identifying and evaluating
    defects in as-grown 4H-SiC (Silicon Carbide) homoepitaxial wafer by systematically
    combining two test methods of optical inspection and photoluminescence (PL). Additionally,
    this document exemplifies optical inspection and PL images to enable the detection
    and categorization of defects in SiC homoepitaxial wafers.
