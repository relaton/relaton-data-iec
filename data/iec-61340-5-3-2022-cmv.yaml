  content: "IEC 61340-5-3:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61340-5-3:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61340-5-3:2015
    edition 2.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 101 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant change.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61340-5-3:2022
    defines the ESD protective packaging properties required to protect ESD sensitive
    devices (ESDSs) through all phases of production, rework and maintenance, transport
    and storage. Test methods are referenced to evaluate packaging and packaging materials
    for these product and material properties. Performance limits are provided.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not address protection from electromagnetic interference
    (EMI), electromagnetic pulsing (EMP) or protection of electrically initiated explosive
    materials or devices.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) reference
    to IEC 61340-4-10 was removed;<br />\r\nb) material resistance property \"electrostatic
    field shielding\" was removed;<br />\r\nc) the requirement for electrostatic discharge
    shielding was changed from 50 nJ to 20 nJ;<br />\r\nd) Table 1 – footnote \"b\"
    was changed to mention the two-point probe in IEC 61340-2-3;<br />\r\ne) \"shall
    be marked\" was changed to \"should be marked\" in 7.2.2 and 7.2.3;<br />\r\nf)
    Table 3 – the classification symbol and the primary function code F was removed;<br
    />\r\ng) Table A.2 – references to IEC TS 61340-5-4 [2] and IEC TR 61340-5-5 [3]
    were added;<br />\r\nh) Annex C – guidance regarding electric field shielding
    was added;<br />\r\ni) Annex D – low charging material property was added."
