  content: "IEC 62275:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62275:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 62275:2018
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 23A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62275:2022 specifies requirements for metallic, non-metallic
    and composite cable ties and their associated fixing devices as a means used for
    managing or securing the wiring systems in electrical installations. Cable ties
    and associated fixing devices can also be suitable for other applications, such
    as support of wiring systems, and where so used, additional requirements can apply.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2018.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    scope clarification,<br />\r\n- new definitions,<br />\r\n- deletion of the exception
    for the stabilization of the moisture content,<br />\r\n- possibility to carry
    out tensile strength tests with dead weights,<br />\r\n- differentiation of rubber
    and acrylic adhesive fixings,<br />\r\n- clarification for mechanical testing
    of integral devices,<br />\r\n- clarifications on Table 6,<br />\r\n- clarifications
    in 9.1,<br />\r\n- the minimum installation temperature test for cable ties is
    carried out only when the declared minimum temperature is lower than 0 °C,<br
    />\r\n- a requirement that metallic cable ties be classified according to 6.2.3,<br
    />\r\n- definition of colours to be tested for contribution to fire,<br />\r\n-
    addition of a \"some countries\" note in Clause 10,<br />\r\n- clarification of
    the mounting of fixing devices in the resistance to ultraviolet light test,<br
    />\r\n- clarification on the testing of integral devices in the resistance to
    ultraviolet light test."
