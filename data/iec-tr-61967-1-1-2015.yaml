  content: "IEC TR 61967-1-1:2015(E) provides guidance for exchanging data generated
    by near-field scan measurements. The described exchange format could also be used
    for near-field scan data generated by simulation or computation software. It should
    be noted that, although it has been developed for near-field scan, its use is
    not restricted to this application. The exchange format can be applied to emission
    and immunity near-field scan data in the frequency and time domains. The scope
    of this technical report includes neither the methods used for the measurements
    or simulations, nor the software and algorithms used for generating the exchange
    file or for processing or viewing the data contained therein. This edition includes
    the following significant changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Addition of: 3D objects; Binary data files; Piece-wise linear time domain and
    frequency domain data; Vectors permitting rotation and offset of measurement and
    DUT reference planes; Transducer gain and probe factor can be complex; New keywords:
    Object3d, Mapobj, Maxhold, Datafileformat, Vx, Vy, Vz, Target, Software, Data_source.<br
    />\r\n- Updating of: Probe factor and corresponding keywords.<br />\r\n- Modification
    of: Keywords: Average."
