abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63558:2025 describes the factors related to classification of the
    real-life environment according to acoustic indicators and linguistic indicators.
    The set of factors can be used to describe complexities of use scenarios, from
    level 1 to 4, and can be helpful when setting up the testing environment.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies for evaluating automatic speech recognition technology which
    is widely used for smart equipment, such as smart speakers"
