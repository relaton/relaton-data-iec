  content: "IEC TS 61496-4-3:2022 specifies requirements for the design, construction
    and testing of non-contact electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed
    specifically to detect persons or parts of persons as part of a safety-related
    system, employing vision-based protective devices (VBPDs) using stereo vision
    techniques (VBPDST) for the sensing function. Special attention is directed to
    features which ensure that an appropriate safety-related performance is achieved.
    An ESPE can include optional safety-related functions, the requirements for which
    are given in Annex A of IEC 61496-1:2020 and this document. Where this document
    does not contain all necessary provisions, IEC TS 62998-1 applies. It is also
    possible, for those aspects not considered in this document, to use provisions
    from IEC TS 62998-1 additionally. This document does not specify the dimensions
    or configurations of the detection zone and its disposition in relation to hazardous
    parts for any particular application, nor what constitutes a hazardous state of
    any machine. It is restricted to the functioning of the ESPE and how it interfaces
    with the machine. The detection principle is based on the evaluation of images
    from different viewing points (stereoscopic view) for the determination of distance
    information. This distance information is used to determine the position of an
    object(s).<br />\r\n– This document is limited to vision based ESPEs with fixed
    distances (stereo base) and fixed directions of the optical axes using a fixed
    focal length.<br />\r\n– It is limited to vision based ESPEs that do not require
    human intervention for detection.<br />\r\n– It is limited to vision based ESPEs
    that detect objects entering into or being present in a detection zone(s).<br
    />\r\n– It is limited to VBPDSTs employing radiation at wavelengths within the
    range 400 nm to 1 500 nm.<br />\r\n– This document does not address those aspects
    required for complex classification or differentiation of the object detected.<br
    />\r\n– This document does not consider the aspects of a moving ESPE installation.<br
    />\r\nAdditional requirements and tests can apply in the following cases:<br />\r\n–
    Use of multi-spectral (colour) techniques;<br />\r\n– Setups other than as shown
    in Figure 2 and Figure 3 (e.g. changing backgrounds, horizontal orientation of
    the optical axis with respect to the floor);<br />\r\n– Intended for outdoor applications.<br
    />\r\nThis document is relevant for VBPDSTs having a stated detection capability
    up to 200 mm. This document can be relevant to applications other than those for
    the protection of persons or parts of persons like arm or fingers (in the range
    14 mm to 200 mm), for example the protection of machinery or products from mechanical
    damage. In those applications, additional requirements can be necessary, for example
    when the materials that are to be recognized by the sensing function have different
    properties from those of persons. This document does not deal with EMC emission
    requirements.<br />\r\nIEC TS 61496-4-3:2022 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2015-05. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Some requirement clauses and test procedures have been adapted or removed
    because they have been consolidated in IEC 61496-1:2020 (e.g. 5.4.6.2 Light sources
    or Clause A.9)."
