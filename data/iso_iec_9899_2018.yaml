- content: "<p>1 This document specifies the form and establishes the interpretation
    of programs written in the C</p><p>programming language.1) It specifies</p><p>-
    the representation of C programs;</p><p>- the syntax and constraints of the C
    language;</p><p>- the semantic rules for interpreting C programs;</p><p>- the
    representation of input data to be processed by C programs;</p><p>- the representation
    of output data produced by C programs;</p><p>- the restrictions and limits imposed
    by a conforming implementation of C.</p><p>2 This document does not specify</p><p>-
    the mechanism by which C programs are transformed for use by a data-processing
    system;</p><p>- the mechanism by which C programs are invoked for use by a data-processing
    system;</p><p>- the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a
    C program;</p><p>- the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being
    produced by a C program;</p><p>- the size or complexity of a program and its data
    that will exceed the capacity of any specific</p><p>data-processing system or
    the capacity of a particular processor;</p><p>- all minimal requirements of a
    data-processing system that is capable of supporting a conforming</p><p>implementation.</p>"
