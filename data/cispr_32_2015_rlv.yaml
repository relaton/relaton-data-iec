abstract:
- content: "CISPR 32:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nCISPR 32:2015 applies
    to multimedia equipment (MME) as defined in 3.1.24 and having a rated r.m.s. AC
    or DC supply voltage not exceeding 600 V. This publication covers two classes
    of MME (Class A and Class B). The MME classes are specified in Clause 4. The objectives
    of this publication are:<br />\r\n1) to establish requirements which provide an
    adequate level of protection of the radio spectrum, allowing radio services to
    operate as intended in the frequency range 9 kHz to 400 GHz;<br />\r\n2) to specify
    procedures to ensure the reproducibility of measurement and the repeatability
    of results.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
