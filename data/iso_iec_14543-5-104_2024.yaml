abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14543-5-194:2024(E) specifies the remote access (RA) server-based
    application framework, device interaction model, flow process and interfaces,
    and message formats to achieve intelligent grouping, resource sharing and service
    collaboration among IGRS smart lock devices.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to smart lock devices with direct network connections or connections through an
    intermediary network to a server for security authentication. This server utilizes
    a method to minimize the possibility of unauthorized access to these smart locks,
    while maintaining seamless interoperability among users, smart lock devices and
    RA servers at home, office or other remote environments."
