abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 29149:2012 explains how to provide and use time-stamping services
    so that time-stamp tokens are effective when used to provide timeliness, data
    integrity, and non-repudiation services in conjunction with other mechanisms.
    It defines:how time-stamp requesters should use time-stamp token generation services;how
    TSAs (time-stamping authorities) should provide a service of guaranteed quality;how
    TSAs should deserve trust based on good practices;which algorithms and parameters
    should be used in TST (time-stamp token) generation and TST renewal, so that TSTs
    resist during the time period during which the TSTs can be verified as being valid;how
    time-stamp verifiers should use the time-stamp token verification services, both
    when validating individual TSTs, and when validating sequences of renewal TSTs.
