    <p>ISO/IEC 19798:2007 defines a method for testing and calculation of average yield measured in the number of standard pages for a colour toner cartridge and specific printer printing in a semi-continuous mode under a defined set of conditions. It uses the test page suite defined in ISO/IEC 24712. ISO/IEC 19798:2007 can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital input-printing path (i.e. multi-function devices that contain printer components). </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19798:2007 is only intended for the measurement of colour toner cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p>
