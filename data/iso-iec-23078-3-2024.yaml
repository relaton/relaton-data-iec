  content: <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document defines a technical
    solution for encrypting resources in digital publications (especially EPUB), effectively
    registering a device certificate to providers and securely delivering decryption
    keys to reading systems included in licenses tailored to specific devices. This
    technical solution uses the passphrase-based authentication method defined in
    ISO/IEC 23078-2 for reading systems to receive the license and access the encrypted
    resources of such digital publications.</span></p>
