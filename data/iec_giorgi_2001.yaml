abstract:
- content: In October 1901, a very successful Italian scientist and engineer Giovanni
    Giorgi showed at the congress of the Associazione Elettrotecnica Italiana (A.E.I.)
    in Rome that a coherent system of units could be achieved by adding an electric
    unit to the three mechanical units (centimetre, gram, second) of the existing
    CGS system. The event can be considered as the birth of what is now known as the
    International System of Units, or SI.
