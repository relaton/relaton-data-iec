- content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document specifies minimum
    recommendations for zero-copy data integration and includes guidance for building
    modular capabilities within a controlled data management environment which can
    be applied either as stand-alone experiences or combined into advanced solutions.</p><p>This
    document provides a blueprint for IT and other leaders who rely on organizational
    data integrity to perform their functions to support the build of new digital
    solutions with granular and universally enforced data controls.</p><p>This document
    applies to all sectors, including public and private companies, government entities,
    and not-for-profit organizations.</p><p>This document is not intended for non-data
    intensive operational roles and does not specify interfaces with other systems
    or components.</p><p>NOTE 1: This document does not define the specific people
    or groups who represent the rightful owner of given data – this is to be worked
    out by individual organizations.</p><p>NOTE 2 to entry: This document does not
    force organizations into converging on a single data ontology, rather, it is intended
    to support a diversity of data models using the same physical data.</p><p>NOTE
    3: This document does not cover data exchanges or the management of data usage,
    including potential applications involving artificial intelligence. Guidance for
    data usage can be found in the following: ISO/IEC 5207 and ISO/IEC 5212.</p>'
