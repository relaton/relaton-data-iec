abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies minimum recommendations for zero-copy data
    integration and includes guidance for building modular capabilities within a controlled
    data management environment which can be applied either as stand-alone experiences
    or combined into advanced solutions.</p><p>This document provides a blueprint
    for IT and other leaders who rely on organizational data integrity to perform
    their functions to support the build of new digital solutions with granular and
    universally enforced data controls.</p><p>This document applies to all sectors,
    including public and private companies, government entities, and not-for-profit
    organizations.</p><p>This document is not intended for non-data intensive operational
    roles and does not specify interfaces with other systems or components.</p><p>NOTE
    1: This document does not define the specific people or groups who represent the
    rightful owner of given data â€“ this is to be worked out by individual organizations.</p><p>NOTE
    2 to entry: This document does not force organizations into converging on a single
    data ontology, rather, it is intended to support a diversity of data models using
    the same physical data.</p><p>NOTE 3: This document does not cover data exchanges
    or the management of data usage, including potential applications involving artificial
    intelligence. Guidance for data usage can be found in the following: ISO/IEC 5207
    and ISO/IEC 5212.</p>"
