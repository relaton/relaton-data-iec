abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 960 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and
    Medical (ISM) band used in item management applications. It provides a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 is intended to allow for compatibility
    and to encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in
    the international marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters
    for technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating
    channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic radiated
    power (EIRP), spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate,
    bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels,
    frequency hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further
    defines the communications protocol used in the air interface.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18000-6:2010 specifies the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter,
    Interrogator-Talks-First (ITF) or tag-talks-only-after-listening (TOTAL) RFID
    system. The system comprises Interrogators, and tags, also known as labels. An
    Interrogator receives information from a tag by transmitting a continuous-wave
    (CW) RF signal to the tag; the tag responds by modulating the reflection coefficient
    of its antenna, thereby backscattering an information signal to the Interrogator.
    The system is ITF, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient
    with an information signal only after being directed to do so by an Interrogator,
    or TOTAL, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with
    an information signal upon entering an Interrogator's field after first listening
    for Interrogator modulation in order to determine if the system is ITF or not.<br
    /><br />\r\nIn detail, ISO/IEC 18000-6:2010 contains one mode with four types.
    The detailed technical differences between the four types are shown in the associated
    parameter tables.<br /><br />\r\nTypes A, B and C are ITF. Type A uses Pulse-Interval
    Encoding (PIE) in the forward link and an adaptive ALOHA collision-arbitration
    algorithm. Type B uses Manchester in the forward link and an adaptive binary-tree
    collision-arbitration algorithm. Type C uses PIE in the forward link and a random
    slotted collision-arbitration algorithm.<br /><br />\r\nType D is TOTAL based
    on Pulse Position Encoding or Miller M=2 encoded subcarrier.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18000-6:2010 specifies<br /><br />\r\nphysical interactions (the signalling layer
    of the communication link) between Interrogators and tags,<br />\r\nInterrogator
    and tag operating procedures and commands,<br />\r\nthe collision arbitration
    scheme used to identify a specific tag in a multiple-tag environment."
