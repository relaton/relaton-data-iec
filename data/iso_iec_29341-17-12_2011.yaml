abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29341-17-12:2011(E) describes the service type that enables modelling
    of the 'QosPolicyHolder' function capabilities. The functionality for the QosPolicyHolder
    Service can be implemented by any device on the network. The QosPolicyHolder Service
    is responsible for providing the traffic policy values for any given traffic stream
    as requested by an entity that manages the network traffic, typically a QoS Manager.
    The traffic policy values are determined by applying the policy rules, which are
    configured for the network, to the requested traffic information. This service
    definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.
