    <p>This document specifies the requirements for a protocol derived from HCI/HCP (see ETSI TS 102 622) enabling communication for devices regardless of data link and physical layers. This document covers the following:</p>
    <p>a)   outline of a system comprised of one or more hosts and one controller;</p>
    <p>b)   extension of connection topology between hosts and host controller (i.e. star topology and additional other topologies);</p>
    <p>c)   segregation between existing system using ETSI TS102 613 and new system compliant to this document (this document refers ETSI TS 102 613, but does not change its specification and does not use RFU).</p>
    <p>For ETSI TS 102 622, data link layer and physical layer like SWP specified in ETSI TS 102 613 is out of the scope.</p>
    <p>Albeit questioned in this document, the duplication of OSI transport layer by e.g. enforcing encapsulation of HCP into T=1 or the reverse, is out of the scope.</p>
