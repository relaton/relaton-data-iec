abstract:
- content: "IEC/PAS 62814:2012(E) introduces the concept of assuring reused components
    and their usage within new products. It provides information and criteria about
    the tests and analysis required for products containing such reused parts. The
    objective is to support the engineering requirements for functionality and tests
    of reusable software components and composite systems containing such components
    in evaluating and assuring reuse dependability. \nKeywords: reused software components,
    dependability"
