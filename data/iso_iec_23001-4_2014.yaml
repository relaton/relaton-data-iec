abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 23001-4:2014 defines the methods and general principles capable
    of describing codec configurations in the so-called reconfigurable video coding
    (RVC) framework. It primarily addresses reconfigurable video aspects and focuses
    on the description of representation for video codec configurations within the
    RVC framework.</p><p>Within the scope of the RVC framework, two languages, namely
    FNL and RVC-BSDL, are specified normatively. FNL is a language that describes
    the FND, also known as "network of FUs". RVC-BSDL is a pertinent subset of BSDL
    defined in ISO/IEC 23001-5. This RVC-BSDL also includes possibilities for further
    extensions, which are necessary to provide complete description of video bitstreams.</p>
