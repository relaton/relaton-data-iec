abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-21:2022 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristics<br />\r\n- elemental composition, and<br
    />\r\n- C/O ratio<br />\r\nfor powders of graphene-based materials by<br />\r\n-
    X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).<br />\r\nThe elemental composition (species
    and relative abundance) is derived by the elemental binding energy and integral
    peak area at corresponding portion of XPS spectrum.<br />\r\n- The elemental composition
    refers to main elements in graphene powders, typically including carbon (C), oxygen
    (O), nitrogen (N), sulfur (S), chloride (Cl) and silicon (Si).<br />\r\n- This
    document is applicable to graphene powders consisting of graphene, bilayer graphene
    (2LG), trilayer graphene (3LG), few-layer graphene (FLG), graphene nanoplate (GNP),
    reduced graphene oxide (rGO), graphene oxide (GO), and functionalized graphene
    powders.<br />\r\n- Typical application areas are the microelectronics and thermal
    management industries, e.g. batteries, integrated circuits, high-frequency electronics.
    This document can be used by manufacturers in research and development and by
    downstream users for product selection."
