abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24779-4:2017 contains a set of symbols, icons and pictograms
    to help the general public understand the concepts and procedures for using electronic
    systems that collect and/or process fingerprints. This set of symbols, icons and
    pictograms is designed to be used to</p><p>- identify the type of biometric device,</p><p>-
    provide static instructions related to a fingerprint device,</p><p>- display dynamic
    real-time information related to the fingerprint device, and</p><p>- indicate
    the status of the fingerprint device.</p><p>To provide this functionality, the
    set of symbols, icons and pictograms includes both directional symbols, icons
    and pictograms and real-time action or feedback symbols, icons and pictograms.
    The fingerprint device symbols, icons and pictograms can be categorized as</p><p>-
    finger/hand general biometric,</p><ul><li>- kind of finger, four fingers or hand
    device,</li></ul><p>- finger/hand placement,</p><ul><li>- biometric position and
    impression which needs to be presented next,</li><li>- hand orientation (switched
    hands),</li></ul><p>- finger/hand quality feedback,</p><ul><li>- press (more or
    less),</li><li>- raise/lower angle,</li></ul><p>- finger/hand positioning,</p><ul><li>-
    hand/finger orientation,</li><li>- necessary finger/hand movement (forward, backward,
    lateral),</li><li>- rotation,</li><li>- change angle, and</li><li>- rolling finger(s).</li></ul><p>Although
    the symbols, icons and pictograms are presented individually, it is intended that
    the symbols, icons and pictograms be combined to fully illustrate the fingerprinting
    interaction.</p><p>Alternative illustrations might be used; for example, in a
    customs or immigration environment, procedures constructed from the individual
    symbols, icons and pictograms could additionally be presented as</p><p>- a series
    of posters while waiting to use the biometric system,</p><p>- a series of transitional
    frames in a biometric booth,</p><p>- an animated video or series of transitional
    frames while waiting to use the biometric system, and</p><p>- instructional leaflets
    to read while waiting to use the biometric system.</p><p>This multi-part International
    standard focuses on communication with the data capture subject. Operators could
    use this International standard, but they might need additional symbols and information.</p>"
