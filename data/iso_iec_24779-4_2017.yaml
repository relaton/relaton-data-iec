abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24779-4:2017 contains a set of symbols, icons and pictograms to
    help the general public understand the concepts and procedures for using electronic
    systems that collect and/or process fingerprints. This set of symbols, icons and
    pictograms is designed to be used to<br />\r\n- identify the type of biometric
    device,<br />\r\n- provide static instructions related to a fingerprint device,<br
    />\r\n- display dynamic real-time information related to the fingerprint device,
    and<br />\r\n- indicate the status of the fingerprint device.<br />\r\nTo provide
    this functionality, the set of symbols, icons and pictograms includes both directional
    symbols, icons and pictograms and real-time action or feedback symbols, icons
    and pictograms. The fingerprint device symbols, icons and pictograms can be categorized
    as<br />\r\n- finger/hand general biometric,<br />\r\n - kind of finger, four
    fingers or hand device,<br />\r\n- finger/hand placement,<br />\r\n - biometric
    position and impression which needs to be presented next,<br />\r\n - hand orientation
    (switched hands),<br />\r\n- finger/hand quality feedback,<br />\r\n - press (more
    or less),<br />\r\n - raise/lower angle,<br />\r\n- finger/hand positioning,<br
    />\r\n - hand/finger orientation,<br />\r\n - necessary finger/hand movement (forward,
    backward, lateral),<br />\r\n - rotation,<br />\r\n - change angle, and<br />\r\n
    - rolling finger(s).<br />\r\nAlthough the symbols, icons and pictograms are presented
    individually, it is intended that the symbols, icons and pictograms be combined
    to fully illustrate the fingerprinting interaction.<br />\r\nAlternative illustrations
    might be used; for example, in a customs or immigration environment, procedures
    constructed from the individual symbols, icons and pictograms could additionally
    be presented as<br />\r\n- a series of posters while waiting to use the biometric
    system,<br />\r\n- a series of transitional frames in a biometric booth,<br />\r\n-
    an animated video or series of transitional frames while waiting to use the biometric
    system, and<br />\r\n- instructional leaflets to read while waiting to use the
    biometric system.<br />\r\nThis multi-part International standard focuses on communication
    with the data capture subject. Operators could use this International standard,
    but they might need additional symbols and information."
