  content: "ISO 20615:2018 This document specifies a method for determining the electrostatic
    charging propensity of fibre ropes by measuring the surface potential generated
    by tribocharging.<br />\r\nThis document is not intended to be used to evaluate
    the safety of ropes for use in explosive atmospheres as safety also depends on
    application conditions.<br />\r\nThe test method described in this document is
    only applicable to fibre ropes of diameter between 12 mm and 20 mm.<br />\r\nThe
    result obtained using this test method is valid only for the charging mechanism
    and parameters described in the test method. Charging can be different in end-use
    applications."
