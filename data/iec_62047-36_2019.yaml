abstract:
- content: IEC 62047-36:2019 (E) specifies test methods for evaluating the durability
    of MEMS piezoelectric thin film materials under the environmental stress of temperature
    and humidity and under electrical stress, and test conditions for appropriate
    quality assessment. Specifically, this document specifies test methods and test
    conditions for measuring the durability of a DUT under temperature and humidity
    conditions and applied voltages. It further applies to evaluations of converse
    piezoelectric properties in piezoelectric thin films formed primarily on silicon
    substrates, i.e., piezoelectric thin films used as actuators. This document does
    not cover reliability assessments, such as methods of predicting the lifetime
    of a piezoelectric thin film based on a Weibull distribution.
