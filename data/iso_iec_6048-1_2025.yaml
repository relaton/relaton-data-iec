abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies an image coding technology known as JPEG AI
    learning-based image coding (JPEG AI) comprising an image coding technology that
    facilitates the compression and processing of images for both human and machine
    vision. The scope of the JPEG AI document is the creation of a learning-based
    image coding standard offering a single-stream, compact compressed domain representation,
    targeting both human visualization, with significant compression efficiency improvement
    over image coding standards in common use at equivalent subjective quality, and
    effective performance for image processing and computer vision tasks.</p><p>The
    core coding system describes JPEG AI standard for the human vision reconstruction
    task and thus specifies the JPEG AI specifies the parsing coded stream and the
    image reconstruction process. Only the syntax format, semantics, and associated
    decoding process requirements are specified, while other matters such as pre-processing,
    the encoding process, system signalling and multiplexing, data loss recovery,
    post-processing, and video display are considered to be outside the scope of this
    document.</p><p>This document is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves
    a wide range of applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services.
    In the course of creating this document, several requirements from typical applications
    have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements have been developed, and
    these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence, this document is designed
    to facilitate image data interchange among different applications and services.</p>"
