abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-302-2:2019 defines the specific requirements of low voltage
    marine power switchgear and controlgear assemblies (MPSC-assemblies) as follows:<br
    />\r\n- stationary assemblies with enclosure for which the rated voltage does
    not exceed 1 000 V AC or 1500 V DC;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for use in
    conjunction with the power generation, distribution and conversion of electric
    energy, and for the control of electric energy consuming equipment.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to all assemblies whether they are designed, manufactured and
    verified on a one-off basis or fully standardised and manufactured in quantity.<br
    />\r\nThe manufacture and/or assembly can be carried out other than by the original
    manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to individual devices and
    self-contained components, such as motor starters, fuse switches, electronic equipment,
    which comply with the relevant product standards.<br />\r\nThis first edition
    cancels and replaces the fourth edition of IEC 60092-302 published in 1997. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    this document has been renumbered to fall in line with IEC 61439 (all parts);<br
    />\r\nb) this document has been restructured to fall in line with IEC 61439 (all
    parts);<br />\r\nc) the creepage distances have been modified;<br />\r\nd) the
    references to non type tested assemblies (NTTA) have been removed;<br />\r\ne)
    non-applicable tables have been removed;<br />\r\nf) the applicability of IEC
    61439 (all parts) annexes have been identified.<br />\r\ng) specific requirements
    that were detailed in IEC 60092-302:1997, covered under 7.6.101 have partly been
    moved to 60092-201."
