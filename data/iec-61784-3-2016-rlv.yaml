  content: "IEC 61784-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61784-3:2016 series
    explains some common principles that can be used in the transmission of safety-relevant
    messages among participants within a distributed network which use fieldbus technology
    in accordance with the requirements of IEC 61508 series for functional safety.
    These principles are based on the black channel approach. They can be used in
    various industrial applications such as process control, manufacturing automation
    and machinery. This part and the IEC 61784-3-x parts specify several functional
    safety communication profiles based on the communication profiles and protocol
    layers of the fieldbus technologies in IEC 61784-1, IEC 61784-2 and the IEC 61158
    series. These functional safety communication profiles use the black channel approach,
    as defined in IEC 61508. These functional safety communication profiles are intended
    for implementation in safety devices exclusively. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- clarifications and additional explanations
    for requirements, updated references;<br />\r\n- deletion of technical overviews
    of profiles (Clauses 6 to 13), and associated dedicated subclauses for terms,
    definitions, symbols and abbreviations;<br />\r\n- addition of profiles for Communication
    Profile Families 8, 17 and 18 (Clauses 10, 14, 15);<br />\r\n- clarifications
    of models in Annex A; Annex B changed from informative to normative;<br />\r\n-
    addition of a new informative Annex E describing models for explicit and implicit
    FSCP mechanisms;<br />\r\n- addition of a new informative Annex F introducing
    an extended model for estimation of the total residual error rate;<br />\r\n-
    updates in parts for CPF 1, CPF 2, CPF 3, CPF 8, CPF 13 (details provided in the
    parts);<br />\r\n- addition of a new part for CPF 17."
