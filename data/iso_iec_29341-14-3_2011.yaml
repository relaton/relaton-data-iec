abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-14-3:2011 is a device specification compliant with the UPnPTM Device Architecture
    version 1.0. It defines a device type referred to herein as MediaServer. The MediaServer
    specification defines a general-purpose device that can be used to instantiate
    any Consumer Electronics (CE) device that provides AV content (for example, media)
    to other UPnP devices on the home network. It is based on the UPnP AV Architecture
    Framework (described in another document). It exposes its content via the ContentDirectory
    service (refer to the ContentDirectory service specification for details). The
    MediaServer MAY also provide functionality to record content using heScheduledRecording
    service (refer to the ScheduledRecording service specification). As such, the
    MediaServer can handle any specific type of media, any data format, and transfer
    protocol."
