abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29341-14-3:2011(E) is a device specification compliant with the
    UPnPTM Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred to herein
    as MediaServer. The MediaServer specification defines a general-purpose device
    that can be used to instantiate any Consumer Electronics (CE) device that provides
    AV content (for example, media) to other UPnP devices on the home network. It
    is based on the UPnP AV Architecture Framework (described in another document).
    It exposes its content via the ContentDirectory service (refer to the ContentDirectory
    service specification for details). The MediaServer MAY also provide functionality
    to record content using heScheduledRecording service (refer to the ScheduledRecording
    service specification). As such, the MediaServer can handle any specific type
    of media, any data format, and transfer protocol.
