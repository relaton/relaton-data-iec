  content: "IEC 60335-2-34:2012+A1:2015+A2:2016(E) deals with the safety of sealed
    (hermetic and semi-hermetic type) motor-compressors, their protection and control
    systems, if any, which are intended for use in equipment for household and similar
    purposes and which conform with the standards applicable to such equipment. It
    applies to motor-compressors tested separately, under the most severe conditions
    that may be expected to occur in normal use, their rated voltage being not more
    than 250 V for single-phase motor-compressors and 480 V for other motor-compressors.
    Examples of equipment which contain motor-compressors are:<br />\r\n- refrigerators,
    food freezers and ice makers (IEC 60335-2-24);<br />\r\n- air-conditioners, electric
    heat pumps and dehumidifiers (IEC 60335-2-40);<br />\r\n- commercial dispensing
    appliances and vending machines (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n- factory-built assemblies
    for transferring heat in applications for refrigerating, air-conditioning or heating
    purposes or a combination of such purposes.<br />\r\nThis standard does not supersede
    the requirements of standards relevant to the particular appliance in which the
    motor-compressor is used. However, if the motor-compressor type used complies
    with this standard, the tests for the motor-compressor specified in the particular
    appliance standard may not need to be made in the particular appliance or assembly.
    If the motor-compressor control system is associated with the particular appliance
    control system, additional tests may be necessary on the final appliance. Keywords:
    Motor compressor, hermetic; semi-hermetic<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/44013\">
    IEC 60335-1:2010</a>. This consolidated version consists of the fifth edition
    (2012), its amendment 1 (2015) and its amendment 2 (2016). Therefore, no need
    to order amendments in addition to this publication. The contents of the corrigendum
    to Amendment 1 of June 2015 and corrigendum 2 of June 2017 have been included
    in this copy."
