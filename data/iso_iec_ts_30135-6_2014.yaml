abstract:
- content: "<p>This specification, EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier (epubcfi), defines
    a standardized method for</p><p>referencing arbitrary content within an EPUB®
    Publication through the use of fragment identifiers.</p><p>The Web has proven
    that the concept of hyperlinking is tremendously powerful, but EPUB Publications</p><p>have
    been denied much of the benefit that hyperlinking makes possible because of the
    lack of a</p><p>standardized scheme to link into them. Although proprietary schemes
    have been developed and</p><p>implemented for individual Reading Systems, without
    a commonly-understood syntax there has been no</p><p>way to achieve cross-platform
    interoperability. The functionality that can see significant benefit from</p><p>breaking
    down this barrier, however, is varied: from reading location maintenance to annotation</p><p>attachment
    to navigation, the ability to point into any Publication opens a whole new dimension
    not</p><p>previously available to developers and Authors.</p><p>This specification
    attempts to rectify this situation by defining an arbitrary structural reference
    that can</p><p>uniquely identify any location, or simple range of locations, in
    a Publication: the EPUB CFI. The following</p><p>considerations have strongly
    influenced the design and scope of this scheme:</p><p>· The mechanism used to
    reference content should be interoperable: references to a reading</p><p>position
    created by one Reading System should be usable by another.</p><p>· Document references
    to EPUB content should be enabled in the same way that existing</p><p>hyperlinks
    enable references throughout the Web.</p><p>· Each location in an EPUB file should
    be able to be identified without the need to modify the</p><p> document.</p><p>·
    All fragment identifiers that reference the same logical location should be equal
    when compared.</p><p>· Comparison operations, including tests for sorting and
    comparison, should be able to be</p><p>performed without accessing the referenced
    files.</p><p>· Simple manipulations should be possible without access to the original
    files (e.g., given a</p><p>reference deep in a file, it should be possible to
    generate a reference to the start of the file).</p><p>· Identifier resolution
    should be reasonably efficient (e.g., processing of the first chapter is not</p><p>required
    to resolve a fragment identifier that points to the last chapter).</p><p>· References
    should be able to recover their target locations through parser variations and
    document</p><p>revisions.</p><p>· Expression of simple, contiguous ranges should
    be supported.</p><p>· An extensible mechanism to accommodate future reference
    recovery heuristics should be</p><p>provided.</p>"
