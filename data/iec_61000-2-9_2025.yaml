abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-2-9: 2025 defines the high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP)
    environment that is one of the consequences of a high-altitude nuclear explosion.
    There are two cases of nuclear detonations:<br />\r\n- high-altitude nuclear explosions;<br
    />\r\n- low-altitude nuclear explosions.<br />\r\nFor civil systems, the most
    important case is the high-altitude nuclear explosion. In this case, the other
    effects of the nuclear explosion such as blast, ground shock, thermal and nuclear
    ionizing radiation are not present at the ground level. However, the electromagnetic
    pulse associated with the explosion can cause disruption of, and damage to, communications,
    electronic systems, electric power systems and other portions of the commercial
    critical infrastructures, thereby upsetting the stability of modern society. The
    object of this document is to establish a common reference for the HEMP environment
    in order to select realistic stresses to apply to victim equipment for evaluating
    their performance and in order to develop protection methods to minimize the impacts
    of the HEMP. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 1996. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) updating the document to provide new information on the variation of
    the early-time HEMP on the earth's surface and to provide new information on the
    late-time HEMP;<br />\r\nb) adding a new informative Annex A which provides details
    concerning the development of the early- and late-time standard waveforms in the
    main body, an explanation of the advantages and disadvantages for the use of the
    double exponential waveform, and an explanation of the far field region for the
    early-time HEMP.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-2-9: 2025 has the status of a basic EMC publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 107."
