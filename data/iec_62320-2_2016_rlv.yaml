    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62320-2:2016 specifies
    the operational and performance requirements, methods of testing and required
    test results for AIS AtoN Stations compatible with the performance standards adopted
    by IMO Resolution MSC.74(69), Annex 3, Universal AIS. It incorporates the technical
    characteristics of non-shipborne AIS AtoN equipment,<br />\r\nincluded in Recommendation
    ITU-R M.1371 and IALA Recommendation A-126. Where applicable, it also takes into
    account the ITU Radio Regulations. This standard takes into account other associated
    IEC International Standards and existing national standards, as applicable. This
    document is applicable for automatic identification system (AIS) installations
    on aids to navigation (AtoN). This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- additional
    cyber security measures;<br />\r\n- updated description of configuration via VDL;<br
    />\r\n- updated VDL access scheme requirements;<br />\r\n- new PI sentences and
    VDL message structures with added description for optional TAG blocks;<br />\r\n-
    added requirement for at least one standard method for configuration using Standard
    PI sentences;<br />\r\n- updated test methods and updated Annexes."
