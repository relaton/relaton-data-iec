abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-14:2023+AMD1:2025 CSV applies to capacitors and resistor-capacitor
    combinations intended to be connected to AC mains or other supply with a nominal
    voltage not exceeding 1 000 V AC (RMS), and with a nominal frequency not exceeding
    100 Hz. This document includes also additional specific conditions and requirements
    for the connection to DC supplies with a rated voltage not exceeding 1 500 V DC.
    The principal object of this part of IEC 60384 is to prescribe preferred ratings
    and characteristics and to select, from IEC 60384-1, the appropriate quality assessment
    procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance requirements
    for this type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements prescribed in detail
    specifications referring to this sectional specification are of equal or higher
    performance level; lower performance levels are not permitted. This document also
    provides a schedule of safety tests to be used by national testing stations in
    countries where approval by such stations is required. The overvoltage categories
    in combination with the AC mains voltages for the capacitors classified in this
    document are to be taken from IEC 60664-1.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- in damp heat steady state test, all capacitor types are tested both with
    and without rated voltage; the number of test pieces has been increased;<br />\r\n-
    tangent of loss angle is added In Group 0 tests, in safety tests only;<br />\r\n-
    qualification approval based on safety and performance tests has been removed
    from the main text to a normative annex;<br />\r\n- the range of rated voltages
    is given instead of exact rated voltage values;<br />\r\n- normative annex for
    description of capacitor styles and of creepage/clearance distance measurement
    has been added;<br />\r\n- the importance of mechanical failures (cracks) in component
    encapsulation as a safety feature is highlighted in handling instructions and
    requirements after all relevant tests.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum
    1 (2024-10) has been included in this copy."
