abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30141:2024 This document provides a standardized IoT Reference
    Architecture using a common vocabulary, reusable designs and industry best practices.
    It uses a top down approach, beginning with collecting the most important characteristics
    of IoT, abstracting those into a generic IoT Conceptual Model, deriving a high
    level system based reference with subsequent dissection of that model into five
    architecture views from different perspectives.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) conformance with ISO/IEC/IEEE
    42010:2022;<br />\r\nb) improved usability;<br />\r\nc) implementation pattern
    support."
