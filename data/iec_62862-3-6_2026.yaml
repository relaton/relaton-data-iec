abstract:
- content: "IEC 62862-3-6:2026 specifies laboratory test methods to assess the durability
    of silvered-glass reflectors with high technical performance to be used in concentrating
    solar technologies. The reflectors within the scope of this document are composed
    of a float-glass substrate and a reflecting silver layer on its back-side, which
    is protected by a thin copper layer and an anticorrosive paint system composed
    of a primer and a top coating, and an optional intermediate coating.<br />\r\nThis
    document defines multiple accelerated aging tests on reflector samples of size
    of 10 cm × 10 cm or larger. It defines the measurement methods to determine the
    degradation parameters used for assessment and the acceptance criteria of the
    accelerated aging tests.<br />\r\nAnnex A of this document outlines the procedure
    to apply this document to reflector types of different composition than that of
    the silvered float-glass reflectors described above.<br />\r\nAnnex B provides
    information on how to approximately correlate the measured degradation of selected
    accelerated aging tests with outdoor exposure in different environments. These
    correlations are limited to silvered float-glass reflector types with the abovementioned
    layer stack, since differing coating types are likely to introduce unforeseen
    degradation modes, which possibly will not be triggered under the proposed testing
    conditions."
