abstract:
- content: "<p>This document covers the development process for designers and developers
    of information for users of software. It describes how to establish what information
    users need, how to determine the way in which that information should be presented,
    and how to prepare the information and make it available. It is not limited to
    the design and development stage of the life cycle, but includes information on
    design throughout the life cycle, such as design strategy and maintaining a design.</p><p>This
    document provides requirements for the structure, information content, and format
    of information for users of software.</p><p>This document can be applied to developing
    the following types of information, although it does not cover all aspects of
    them:</p><p>— information for users of products other than software;</p><p>— multimedia
    systems using animation, video, and sound;</p><p>— computer-based training (CBT)
    packages and specialized course materials intended primarily for use in formal
    training programs;</p><p>— maintenance information describing the internal operation
    of systems software;</p><p>— information for users incorporated into the user
    interface itself.</p><p>This document is applicable to information architects
    and information developers, including a variety of specialists:</p><p>— information
    architects who plan the structure and format of information products;</p><p>—
    usability specialists and business analysts who identify the tasks that the intended
    users can perform with the software;</p><p>— developers and editors of the written
    content of information for users;</p><p>— graphic designers with expertise in
    electronic media;</p><p>— user interface designers and ergonomics experts working
    together to design the presentation of the information on the screen.</p><p>This
    document is also a reference for those with other roles and interests in the process
    of developing information for users:</p><p>— managers of the software development
    process or the information-development process;</p><p>— acquirers of information
    for users prepared by suppliers;</p><p>— usability testers, reviewers of information
    for users, subject-matter experts;</p><p>— developers of tools for creating information
    for users;</p><p>— human-factors experts who identify principles for making information
    for users more accessible and easily used.</p>"
