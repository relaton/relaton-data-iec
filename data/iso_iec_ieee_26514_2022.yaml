abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 26514:2022 This document covers the development process for
    designers and developers of information for users of software. It describes how
    to establish what information users need, how to determine the way in which that
    information should be presented, and how to prepare the information and make it
    available. It is not limited to the design and development stage of the life cycle,
    but includes information on design throughout the life cycle, such as design strategy
    and maintaining a design.<br />\r\nThis document provides requirements for the
    structure, information content, and format of information for users of software.<br
    />\r\nThis document can be applied to developing the following types of information,
    although it does not cover all aspects of them:<br />\r\n- information for users
    of products other than software;<br />\r\n- multimedia systems using animation,
    video, and sound;<br />\r\n- computer-based training (CBT) packages and specialized
    course materials intended primarily for use in formal training programs;<br />\r\n-
    maintenance information describing the internal operation of systems software;<br
    />\r\n- information for users incorporated into the user interface itself.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to information architects and information developers,
    including a variety of specialists:<br />\r\n- information architects who plan
    the structure and format of information products;<br />\r\n- usability specialists
    and business analysts who identify the tasks that the intended users can perform
    with the software;<br />\r\n- developers and editors of the written content of
    information for users;<br />\r\n- graphic designers with expertise in electronic
    media;<br />\r\n- user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together
    to design the presentation of the information on the screen.<br />\r\nThis document
    is also a reference for those with other roles and interests in the process of
    developing information for users:<br />\r\n- managers of the software development
    process or the information-development process;<br />\r\n- acquirers of information
    for users prepared by suppliers;<br />\r\n- usability testers, reviewers of information
    for users, subject-matter experts;<br />\r\n- developers of tools for creating
    information for users;<br />\r\n- human-factors experts who identify principles
    for making information for users more accessible and easily used."
