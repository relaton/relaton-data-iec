abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-18:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">functional
    groups</li></ul>\r\nfor functionalized graphene-based material and graphene oxide
    by<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) coupled
    with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), referred to as TGA-FTIR.</li></ul>\r\nThe
    content of functional groups is derived by changes in mass of the sample as a
    function of temperature using TGA. Materials evolved during these mass changes
    are then analysed using coupled FTIR to identify functional groups.<ul><li style=\"text-align:justify\">The
    functional groups determined according to this document will be listed as a key
    control characteristic in the blank detail specification for graphene IEC 62565-3-1
    for graphene powder.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">The method is applicable
    for functionalized graphene powder and graphene oxide that can be pyrolysed and
    gasified with elevated temperature during TGA.</li><li style=\"text-align:justify\">Typical
    application areas are quality control for graphene manufacturers, and product
    selection for downstream users.</li></ul>"
