abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-18:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic\r\n\r\n\tfunctional groups\r\n\r\nfor
    functionalized graphene-based material and graphene oxide by\r\n\r\n\r\n\tthermogravimetry
    analysis (TGA) coupled with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), referred
    to as TGA-FTIR.\r\n\r\nThe content of functional groups is derived by changes
    in mass of the sample as a function of temperature using TGA. Materials evolved
    during these mass changes are then analysed using coupled FTIR to identify functional
    groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe functional groups determined according to this document
    will be listed as a key control characteristic in the blank detail specification
    for graphene IEC 62565-3-1 for graphene powder.\r\n\tThe method is applicable
    for functionalized graphene powder and graphene oxide that can be pyrolysed and
    gasified with elevated temperature during TGA.\r\n\tTypical application areas
    are quality control for graphene manufacturers, and product selection for downstream
    users."
