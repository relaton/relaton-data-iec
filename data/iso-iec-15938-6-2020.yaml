    <p>The ISO/IEC 15938 series operates on and generates conformant bitstreams. This document provides a specific implementation that behaves in a conformant manner. </p>
    <p>NOTE 1    Other implementations that conform to the ISO/IEC 15938 series are possible, which do not necessarily use the algorithms or the programming techniques of the reference software.</p>
    <p>The software contained in this document is known as eXperimentation Model (XM) and is divided into five categories:</p>
    <p>a)    Binary format for MPEG-7 (BiM). This software converts DDL (XML) based descriptions to binary format and vice versa as explained in Clause 5.</p>
    <p>b)   DDL parser and DDL validation parser. The components of this software module are specified in Clause 6.</p>
    <p>c)   Visual descriptors. This software creates standard visual descriptions from associated (visual) media content as explained in Clause 7. </p>
    <p>NOTE 2    The techniques used for extracting descriptors are informative, and the quality and complexity of these extraction tools has not been optimized.</p>
    <p>d)   Audio descriptors. This software creates standard descriptions from associated (audio) media content as explained in Clause 8. </p>
    <p>NOTE 3    The techniques used for extracting descriptors are informative, and the quality and complexity of these extraction tools has not been optimized.</p>
    <p>e)   Multimedia description schemes. This software modules provide standard descriptions of multimedia description schemes as specified in Clause 9.</p>
