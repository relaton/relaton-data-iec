abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013 specifies syntax and semantics of the data types
    and tools common to the tools defined in the other parts of ISO/IEC 23005, such
    as basic data types which are used as basic building blocks in more than one of
    the tools in ISO/IEC 23005, colour-related basic types which are used in light
    and colourâ€‘related tools to help in specifying colour-related characteristics
    of the devices or commands, and time stamp types which can be used in device commands,
    and sensed information to specify timing related information.<br /><br />\r\nSeveral
    classification schemes which are used in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005 are
    also defined in Annex A of ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013. Other tools to be developed are
    included in ISO/IEC 23005-6:2013, if those tools are to be used with the tools
    defined in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005. Most of the tools defined in ISO/IEC
    23005-6:2013 are not intended to be used alone, but to be used as a part or as
    a supporting tool of other tools defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 23005."
