abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-5:2014+AMD1:2025 CSV applies to hand-held circular saws. This
    standard does not apply to saws designed for use with abrasive wheels. Saws designed
    for use with abrasive wheels as cut-off machines are covered by IEC 62841-2-22.
    The rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools,
    and 480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W.
    The limits for the applicability of this standard for battery tools is given in
    Annex K. This standard deals with the hazards presented by tools which are encountered
    by all persons in the normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the tools.
    Hand-held electric tools, which can be mounted on a support or working stand for
    use as fixed tools without any alteration of the tool itself, are within the scope
    of this standard and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support is considered
    to be a transportable tool and thus covered by the relevant Part 3. The attention
    of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing
    organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new
    requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is
    the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted
    for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.<br
    />\r\nKey words: Saw, Circular, Cutting,<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read
    in conjunction with IEC 62841-1:2014."
