    <p>ISO/IEC 33003:2015 sets out the requirements for process measurement frameworks for use in process assessment. The requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33003:2015 form a structure which</p>
    <p>a)    establish the requirements for process measurement frameworks in the context of process assessment,</p>
    <p>b)    establish the requirements for the validation of process measurement frameworks for use in process assessment, and</p>
    <p>c)    establish requirements that are applicable to any process measurement frameworks to develop composite measures across domains.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 33003:2015 is applicable to the development of process measurement frameworks for any process quality characteristic across all application domains.</p>
