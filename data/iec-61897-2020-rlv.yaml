  content: "IEC 61897:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61897:2020
    applies to aeolian vibration dampers intended for single conductors or earth wires
    or conductor bundles where dampers are directly attached to each subconductor.
    The purchaser may adopt part(s) of this document when specifying requirements
    for cables different from those mentioned above (e.g. optical ground wires (OPGW),
    all dielectric self-supporting optical cables (ADSS)). In some cases, test procedures
    and test values are left to agreement between the purchaser and the supplier and
    are stated in the procurement contract. Annex A lists the minimum technical details
    to be agreed between purchaser and supplier. Throughout this document, the word
    “conductor” is used when the test applies to dampers for conductors or earth wires.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1998.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Consider, in addition to Stockbridge type aeolian vibration dampers, also spiral
    aeolian vibration dampers and elastomeric aeolian vibration dampers.<br />\r\nb)
    Consider the application of dampers on high temperature conductors, specifying
    additional high temperature tests in clamp slip tests.<br />\r\nc) Simplify the
    procedure of the damper effectiveness evaluation.<br />\r\nd) Introduce test at
    low temperature on fastener components such as break away bolts and conical spring
    washers.<br />\r\ne) Include figures showing the test arrangements for the main
    mechanical tests.<br />\r\nKey words: Overhead Lines, Aeolian Vibration Dampers"
