    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-6:2024 deals with the safety of stationary electric cooking
    appliances, such as cooking ranges, hobs, and ovens, for household use, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected
    between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis
    standard also includes some requirements for ovens that are intended to be used
    on board ships.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within the scope of this
    standard are:<br />\r\n– griddles;<br />\r\n– grills;<br />\r\n– induction hobs;<br
    />\r\n– induction wok elements;<br />\r\n– pyrolytic self-cleaning ovens;<br />\r\n–
    steam ovens.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common
    hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around
    the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n– persons
    (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of
    experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without
    supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances intended for commercial
    catering;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– grills, toasters and similar portable cooking
    appliances (IEC 60335-2-9);<br />\r\n– microwave ovens (IEC 60335-2-25).<br />\r\nThis
    seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2014 and Amendment
    1:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion of notes (15.2)
    and conversion of notes to normative text (Clause 1, 3.1.9.101, 7.103, 11.7, 15.2,
    16.2, 22.109, 22.120, 22.132, 22.124, Figure 103);<br />\r\nc) application of
    test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nd) alignment of limits on the temperature
    rise of external accessible surfaces (Clause 11);<br />\r\ne) addition of requirements
    for automatic regulation systems and remote automatic regulation systems for induction
    hobs (3.7.103, 3.11.4, 3.11.5, 3.11.101, 7.12, 19.102, 22.40, 22.62, Annex AA);<br
    />\r\nf) addition of requirements for remote operation of ovens (22.51).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
