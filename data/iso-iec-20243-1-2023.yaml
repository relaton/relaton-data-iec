    <p>ISO/IEC 20243-1:2018 (O-TTPS) is a set of guidelines, requirements, and recommendations that address specific threats to the integrity of hardware and software COTS ICT products throughout the product life cycle. This release of the Standard addresses threats related to maliciously tainted and counterfeit products.</p>
    <p>The provider's product life cycle includes the work it does designing and developing products, as well as the supply chain aspects of that life cycle, collectively extending through the following phases: design, sourcing, build, fulfillment, distribution, sustainment, and disposal. While this Standard cannot fully address threats that originate wholly outside any span of control of the provider ? for example, a counterfeiter producing a fake printed circuit board assembly that has no original linkage to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) ? the practices detailed in the Standard will provide some level of mitigation. An example of such a practice would be the use of security labeling techniques in legitimate products.</p>
