abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62343-6-10:2017(E) which is a Technical Report, discusses the rationale,
    conceptual definition, and minimum list of functions for an intermediate controller
    that delivers a dynamic control signal to multiple dynamic modules. These modules
    are included in an optical-switch-based network node, according to the upper layer
    controller of software-defined optical networking.
