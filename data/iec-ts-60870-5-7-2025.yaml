  content: "IEC TS 60870-5-7:2025, which is a technical specification, describes messages
    and data formats for implementing IEC 62351-5:2023 for secure communication as
    an extension to IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this
    document is to permit the receiver of any IEC 60870-5-101/-104 Application Protocol
    Data Unit (APDU) to verify that the APDU was transmitted by an authorized user
    and that the APDU was not modified in transit.<br />\r\nThis document is also
    intended to be used, together with the definitions of IEC 62351-3:2023, in conjunction
    with the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard.<br />\r\nThe state machines, message
    sequences, and procedures for exchanging these messages are defined in IEC 62351-5:2023.
    This document describes only the message formats, selected options, critical operations,
    addressing considerations and other adaptations required to implement IEC 62351
    in the IEC 60870-5-101 and IEC 60870-5-104 protocols.<br />\r\nIn addition to
    the previous edition, this new edition of this document also addresses role-based
    access control, by utilizing the IEC 62351-8 RBAC approach and the already defined
    role to permission mapping from IEC 62351-5:2023.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document
    does not include security for IEC 60870-5-102 or IEC 60870-5-103. IEC 60870-5-102
    is in limited use only and will therefore not be addressed. Users of IEC 60870-5-103
    desiring a secure solution need to implement IEC 61850 using the security measures
    from in IEC 62351 referenced in IEC 61850.<br />\r\nManagement of keys, certificates
    or other cryptographic credentials within devices or on communication links other
    than IEC 60870-5-101/104 is out of the scope of this document and might be addressed
    by other IEC 62351 publications in the future.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) This edition has been completely
    revised with respect to the previous edition;<br />\r\nb) Alignment with updated
    versions of IEC 62351-3:2023 and IEC 62351-5:2023;<br />\r\nc) Definition of specific
    profiles for application layer and transport layer;<br />\r\nd) Introduction of
    Session Initiation Request to handle situations in which the called station reestablishes
    a connection;<br />\r\ne) Inclusion of multicast security for the unbalanced mode
    of IEC 60870-5-101 including key management;<br />\r\nf) Consideration of RBAC
    based on IEC 62351-8.<br />\r\nThis Technical Specification is to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 62351-5:2023 and IEC 60870-5-104:2016."
