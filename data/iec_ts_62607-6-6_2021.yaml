abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-6:2021(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the structural key control characteristic<br />\r\n• strain uniformity<br />\r\nfor
    single-layer graphene by<br />\r\n• Raman spectroscopy.<br />\r\nThe width of
    the 2D-peak in the Raman spectrum is analysed to calculate the strain uniformity
    parameter which is a figure of merit to quantify the influence of nano-scale strain
    variations on the electronic properties of the layer. The classification will
    help manufacturers to classify their material quality to provide an upper limit
    of the electronic performance of the characterized graphene, to decide whether
    or not the graphene material quality is potentially suitable for various applications."
