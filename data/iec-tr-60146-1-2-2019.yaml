  content: "IEC TR 60146-1-2:2019 gives guidance on variations to the specifications
    given in IEC 60146-1-1:2009 to enable the specification to be extended in a controlled
    form for special cases. Background information is also given on technical points,
    which facilitates the use of IEC 60146-1-1:2009. This technical report primarily
    covers line commutated converters and is not in itself a specification, except
    as regards certain auxiliary components, in so far as existing standards may not
    provide the necessary data. This fifth edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of
    annexes concerning the applications of converter transformers and of fuses for
    overcurrent protection;<br />\r\nb) changes of calculation methods related the
    inductive voltage regulation and changes of description on transformer losses
    to be consistent with the latest transformer standards;<br />\r\nc) addition and
    updates of references based on the latest information."
