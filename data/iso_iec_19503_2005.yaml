abstract:
- content: The main purpose of ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (XMI) is to enable easy interchange
    of metadata between application development lifecycle tools (such as modeling
    tools based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ISO/IEC 19501, and metadata
    repositories/frameworks based on the Meta Object Facility (MOF), ISO/IEC 19502)
    in distributed heterogeneous environments. ISO/IEC 19503:2005 integrates three
    key industry standards:XML, eXtensible Markup Language, a W3C standard;UML, Unified
    Modeling Language, an OMG modeling specification which is now ISO/IEC 19501;MOF,
    Meta Object Facility (ISO/IEC 19502).ISO/IEC 19503:2005 provides specifications
    fora set of XML Schema Definitions (XSD) production rules for transforming MOF-based
    metamodels into XML Schemas;a set of XML Document production rules for encoding
    and decoding MOF-based metadata;design principles for XMI-based Schemas and XML
    documents;a set of production rules for importing XML DTDs to a MOF-based metamodel.ISO/IEC
    19503:2005 enhances metadata management and metadata interoperability in distributed
    object environments in general and in distributed development environments in
    particular. While it addresses stream-based metadata interoperability in the object
    analysis and design domain, ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (in part because it is MOF based)
    is equally applicable to metadata in many other domains.
