abstract:
- content: "<p>The main purpose of ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (XMI) is to enable easy interchange
    of metadata between application development lifecycle tools (such as modeling
    tools based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML), ISO/IEC 19501, and metadata
    repositories/frameworks based on the Meta Object Facility (MOF), ISO/IEC 19502)
    in distributed heterogeneous environments. ISO/IEC 19503:2005 integrates three
    key industry standards:</p><ul><li>XML, eXtensible Markup Language, a W3C standard;</li><li>UML,
    Unified Modeling Language, an OMG modeling specification which is now ISO/IEC
    19501;</li><li>MOF, Meta Object Facility (ISO/IEC 19502).</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    19503:2005 provides specifications for</p><ul><li>a set of XML Schema Definitions
    (XSD) production rules for transforming MOF-based metamodels into XML Schemas;</li><li>a
    set of XML Document production rules for encoding and decoding MOF-based metadata;</li><li>design
    principles for XMI-based Schemas and XML documents;</li><li>a set of production
    rules for importing XML DTDs to a MOF-based metamodel.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 19503:2005
    enhances metadata management and metadata interoperability in distributed object
    environments in general and in distributed development environments in particular.
    While it addresses stream-based metadata interoperability in the object analysis
    and design domain, ISO/IEC 19503:2005 (in part because it is MOF based) is equally
    applicable to metadata in many other domains.</p>"
