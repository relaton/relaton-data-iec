  content: "IEC/PAS 63131:2017(E) defines a set of operational control functions (objects)
    and the associated logical diagram (System Control Diagram (SCD)), for use in
    the continuous control process industry – e.g. as used in Oil and Gas processes.<br
    />\r\nThe main drivers for establishing this as a standard are the advantage of
    efficient engineering, implementation, and commissioning, as well as reuse of
    the control application across different suppliers of control systems. The diagrams
    give a logical representation that is suited for data transfer.<br />\r\nThis
    PAS also includes a method of documenting sequences and their interaction with
    the control objects."
