abstract:
- content: "IEC 61097-7:2025 specifies the minimum performance requirements, technical
    characteristics and test methods with required test results for VHF radio installations
    capable of voice communication and digital selective calling as required by chapter
    IV of the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS).<br />\r\nThis
    document incorporates the applicable part of the performance standards included
    in IMO Resolution A.524(13) and MSC.511(105), the technical characteristics included
    in Recommendation ITU-R M.489-2 and Recommendation ITU-R M.493-16, and takes account
    of IMO Resolution A.694(17) which is associated with IEC 60945, and conforms with
    the ITU Radio Regulations where applicable.<br />\r\nWhen a requirement in this
    document is different from IEC 60945, the requirement in this document shall take
    precedence.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been updated
    to incorporate the provisions of the new IMO performance standards given in Resolution
    MSC.511(105) and new ITU-R recommendations given in M.493-16;<br />\r\nb) the
    provisions for digital selective calling which were previously in IEC 61097-3
    have been incorporated;<br />\r\nc) the provisions for watch keeping receivers
    which were previously in IEC 61097-8 have been incorporated;<br />\r\nd) new requirements
    have been added for a received signal strength indicator in 4.3.4 and for software
    maintenance in 4.6 in support of IMO recommendations;<br />\r\ne) new Annex B
    and Annex E have been added for bridge alert management;<br />\r\nf) new Annex
    C and Annex D have been added for digital selective calling;<br />\r\ng) a new
