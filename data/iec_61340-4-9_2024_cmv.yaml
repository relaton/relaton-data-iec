abstract:
- content: "IEC 61340-4-9:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61340-4-9:2024 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61340-4-9:2016
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 101 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61340-4-9:2024 provides test methods for measuring the electrical
    resistance of garments used for static control applications. These test methods
    can be used for evaluating outer garments that are homogenously conductive or
    homogeneously dissipative, or that utilize surface conductive or surface dissipative
    components or elements.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒIt is possible that the test methods defined
    in this document will not be able to measure materials with buried conductive
    layers.<br />\r\nThis third edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) IEC 61010-1 and IEC
    61010-2-030 added as requirements for measurement equipment;<br />\r\nb) testing
    voltage range for personnel ground path changed from \"7 V DC to 30 V DC\" to
    \"7 V DC to 100 V DC\";<br />\r\nc) cleaning requirements changed from a minimum
    of five cycles of cleaning to a minimum of three cycles of cleaning;<br />\r\nd)
    moderate humidity requirements deleted;<br />\r\ne) figures replaced with generic
    drawings."
