abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-8:2016+AMD1:2025 CSV applies to hand-held shears and nibblers
    the rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools,
    and 480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W.
    The limits for the applicability of this standard for battery tools are given
    in K.1 and L.1. This standard deals with the hazards presented by tools which
    are encountered by all persons in the normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse
    of the tools. Hand-held electric tools, which can be mounted on a support or working
    stand for use as fixed tools without any alteration of the tool itself, are within
    the scope of this standard and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support
    is considered to be a transportable tool and thus covered by the relevant Part
    3. The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers
    and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication
    of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance
    with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised
    tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date
    of publication. Keywords: Shear, Nibbler, Hand-held tool, Transportable tool<br
    /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62841-1:2014."
