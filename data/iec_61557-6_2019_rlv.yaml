abstract:
- content: "IEC 61557-6:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61557-6:2019
    specifies the requirements applicable to measuring equipment for testing the effectiveness
    of protective measures of residual current devices (RCD) installed in TT, TN and
    IT systems. It is not the purpose of this document to verify the RCD according
    to their product standards. IEC 61557-6:2019 cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) addition of requirements for testing a new type of RCD;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of requirements for type B RCDs (former Annex B);<br />\r\nc)
    addition of new Annex B on recommended tripping times;<br />\r\nd) alignment of
    the structure with that of the whole IEC 61557 series."
