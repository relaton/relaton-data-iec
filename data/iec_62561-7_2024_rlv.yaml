abstract:
- content: "IEC 62561-7:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62561-7:2024
    specifies the requirements and tests for earthing enhancing compounds producing
    low resistance of an earth termination system. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Figure A.1 has been replaced
    with a simpler one that clearly shows the high and low corrosion load limits of
    the earth enhancing compounds without the need for special knowledge;<br />\r\nb)
    pH measurement has been introduced."
