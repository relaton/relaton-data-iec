  content: "IEC/TR 62547:2009(E) is a technical report that describes two methods
    for the measurement of the sensitivity of single-mode optical fibres to high-power
    damage at bends.<br /> \n- Method 1 - Failure time characterization as a function
    of the launch power and bend conditions (bend angle and bend diameter).<br />\n-
    Method 2 - Equilibrium temperature measurement."
