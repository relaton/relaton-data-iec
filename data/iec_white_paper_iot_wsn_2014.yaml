abstract:
- content: "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are generating increasing interest from
    industry and research. This is driven by the availability of inexpensive, low-powered
    miniature components such as processors, radios and sensors which are sometimes
    integrated on a single chip.<br /><br />\r\nThe idea of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) developed in parallel to WSNs. While IoT doesnâ€™t assume a specific communication
    technology, wireless communication technologies will play a major role in the
    roll-out of the IoT. WSNs will drive many applications and many industries.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper discusses the use and evolution of WSNs in the
    wider context of the IoT. It provides a review of WSN applications, infrastructures
    technologies, applications as well as standards that apply to WSN designs.<br
    /><br />\r\nThe development of this White Paper was led by the IEC MSB (Market
    Strategy Board) which brings together CTOs of leading international companies
    in cooperation with NIST (the US National Institute of Standards and Technology).<br
    /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for free download."
