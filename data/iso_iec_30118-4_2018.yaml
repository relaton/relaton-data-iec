abstract:
- content: "The OCF Resource Type Specification specifies the Resources that have
    been defined by OCF that may be exposed by an OCF Device.<br />\r\nApplication
    profile device specifications (for example those created for Smart Home or Healthcare)
    specify device types appropriate to the profile; such specifications use Resource
    Type definitions from this document.<br />\r\nThis specification is built on top
    of the OCF Core Specification. The OCF Core Specification specifies the OCF Framework
    that enables the implementation of profiles for IoT usages and ecosystems. The
    OCF Core Framework is scalable to support simple devices (constrained device)
    and more capable devices (smart device)."
