  content: "IEC 60335-2-31:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-31:2024 edition 6.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-31:2012+AMD1:2016+AMD2:2018
    CSV edition 5.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-31:2024 deals with the safety of electric
    range hoods and other cooking fume extractors intended for installing above, beside,
    behind or under household cooking ranges, hobs and similar cooking appliances,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied
    appliances. The cooking appliance can be supplied by electricity or other fuels,
    such as gas. Appliances not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this
    standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards
    presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the
    home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including
    children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience
    and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision
    or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances incorporating electrostatic
    air filters, IEC 60335-2-65 also applies;<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national authorities responsible for buildings and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended
    for commercial purposes (IEC 60335-2-99);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be
    used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a
    corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis sixth edition
    cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2012, Amendment 1:2016 and
    Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 22.8, 22.101, 22.102);<br />\r\nc)
    update of the installation requirements for the heating test to include down-draft
    systems (11.2);<br />\r\nd) addition of accessible surface temperature limits
    (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ne) introduction of IEC TR 62854 to determine compliance
    in case of doubt (22.14);<br />\r\nf) clarification of remote operation requirements
    for range hoods and other cooking fume extraction appliances (22.40, 22.49, 22.51);<br
    />\r\ng) clarification of 30.101 with respect to grease filters and odour extraction
    filters.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
