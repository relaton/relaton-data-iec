abstract:
- content: "IEC 62899-203-2:2025 specifies a method to measure the values of effective
    charge carrier mobility in printed semiconductive layers using space charge limited
    current (SCLC) mobility technique. The method described is intended to be used
    as a benchmark test to allow reproducible measurements at a given temperature
    of the apparent charge carrier mobility for comparison with devices that use different
    materials, material formulations and fabrication processes for a planar configuration.
    This document specifies the sample and equipment requirements, and describes the
    measurement technique, the data analysis procedure and the reporting protocol.<br
    />\r\nThis document is suitable to test unipolar devices (i.e. hole-only or electron-only),
    where charge injection is efficient and where series resistance does not dominate
    the current-voltage curve. Therefore, it cannot be used for testing high-electron
    mobility devices where electron injection can be problematic, for testing highly
    doped materials where space charge limited current does not exist, or to evaluate
    mobility in applications that require lateral charge transport, such as in transistors."
