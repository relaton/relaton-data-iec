abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 9660:2023 This document specifies the volume and file structure
    of compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM) for the interchange of information between
    users of information processing systems.<br />\r\nThis document specifies:<br
    />\r\n- the attributes of the volume and the descriptors recorded on it;<br />\r\n-
    the relationship among volumes of a volume set;<br />\r\n- the placement of the
    files;<br />\r\n- the attributes of the files;<br />\r\n- record structures intended
    for use in the input or output data streams of an application program when such
    data streams are required to be organized as sets of records;<br />\r\n- three
    nested levels of medium interchange;<br />\r\n- two nested levels of implementation;<br
    />\r\n- requirements for the processes which are provided within information processing
    systems, to enable information to be interchanged between different systems, utilizing
    recorded CD-ROM as the medium of interchange; for this purpose, this document
    specifies the functions to be provided within systems which are intended to originate
    or receive CD-ROM which conform to this document."
