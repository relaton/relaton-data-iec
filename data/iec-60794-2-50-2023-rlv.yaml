  content: "IEC 60794-2-50:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-2-50:2023
    specifies requirements for simplex and duplex optical fibre cables for use in
    terminated cable assemblies or as used for termination of passive components.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2020.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    added IEC 60793-1-46 and IEC 60794-1-211 to the normative references;<br />\r\nb)
    changed the load duration for the tensile test from 5 min to 10 min;<br />\r\nc)
    clarified the distance between the clamps for torsion test to 125 times cable
    diameter, but not less than 0,3 m;<br />\r\nd) recommended the temperatures –10
    °C and +60 °C for indoor simplex and duplex cables and included the low and high
    temperatures for category C, CHD, OP and OPHD according to the operating service
    environments in IEC 61753-1 for temperature cycling and shrinkage testing;<br
    />\r\ne) updated the shrinkage test standard to IEC 60794-1-211, F11A, and changed
    the requirement to maximum 20 mm;<br />\r\nf) replaced the text for the fire performance
    with an improved description."
