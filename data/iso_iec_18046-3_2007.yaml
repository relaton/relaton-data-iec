abstract:
- content: Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology has broad applicability
    to the Automatic Identification and Data Capture (AIDC) industry in item management.
    As a wireless communication technique based on radio frequency technology, the
    applications cover multiple levels of the industrial, commercial and retail supply
    chains. These can include    freight containers,   returnable transport items
    (RTIs),   transport units,   product packaging,   product tagging.     Performance
    tests define test methods that deliver results that allow the comparison of different
    RFID systems, interrogator and tags in order to select among them for use in a
    particular application.  The performance characteristics of devices (tags and
    interrogation equipment) can vary drastically due to application factors as well
    as the particular RFID air interface (frequency, modulation, protocol, etc.) being
    supported.  Of key concern is the matching of the various performance characteristics
    to the user application.  Additionally, in an open environment users of such technology
    demand multiple sources for these devices from technology providers.  A key challenge
    is a method of evaluating the differences between various technology providers'
    products in a consistent and equitable manner.  ISO/IEC 18046-3:2007 provides
    a framework for meeting the above-noted concern and challenges. To this end, clear
    definitions of performance as related to user applications of RFID technology
    in the supply chain are provided. Based on such application-based definitions,
    test methods are defined with attention to the test parameters required for a
    consistent evaluation of RFID devices.  Of particular significance, these tests
    are defined for RFID devices having one antenna. It is common practice to have
    products with both single and multiple antennas to define an RFID transaction
    zone sufficient for the application. The defined methods can easily be extended
    from equipment with a single antenna to apply to equipment with multiple antennas,
    in order to evaluate performance under conditions more closely matching those
    of a particular application.   ISO/IEC 18046-3:2007 defines test methods for performance
    characteristics of RFID tags for item management, and specifies the general requirements
    and test requirements for tags which are applicable to the selection of the devices
    for an application. The summary of the test reports form a unified tag datasheet.
    It does not apply to testing in relation to regulatory or similar requirements.
