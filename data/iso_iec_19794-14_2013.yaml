abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19794-14:2013 specifies a data interchange format for the exchange
    of DNA data for person identification or verification technologies that utilize
    human DNA.</p><p>It will provide the ability for DNA profile data to be exchanged
    and used for comparison (subject to privacy regulations) with DNA profile data
    produced by any other system that is based on a compatible DNA profiling technique
    and where the data format conforms to ISO/IEC 19794-14:2013.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19794-14:2013
    is intended to cover current forensic DNA profiling or typing techniques that
    are based on short tandem repeats (STRs), including STRs on the Y chromosome (Y-STRs),
    as well as mitochondrial DNA.</p><p>A single DNA data record for a subject may
    require data resulting from more than one of these different DNA techniques. ISO/IEC
    19794-14:2013 enables data for multiple DNA techniques to be presented in a single
    record for a given subject.</p><p>This data format has been prepared in light
    of ongoing efforts to reduce human involvement in the processing (enrolment and
    comparison) of DNA. In anticipation of the data format requirements for automated
    DNA techniques ISO/IEC 19794-14:2013 will describe a format for both processed
    and raw (electrophoretic) DNA data. Extensible Mark-up Language (XML) encoding
    of the data is used to specify DNA data interchange. A normative XML Schema Definition
    (XSD) specification is provided in Annex B.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19794-14:2013 is not
    intended for any other purposes than exchange of DNA for biometric verification
    and identification of individuals; in particular it does not exchange medical
    and other health-related information.</p>"
