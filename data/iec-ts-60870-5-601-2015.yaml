  content: "IEC TS 60870-5-601:2015(E) describes test cases for conformance testing
    of telecontrol equipment, Substation Automation Systems (SAS) and telecontrol
    systems, including front-end functions of SCADA. The use of this part of IEC 60870
    facilitates interoperability by providing a standard method of testing protocol
    implementations, but it does not guarantee interoperability of devices. It is
    expected that using this part of IEC 60870 during testing will minimize the risk
    of non-interoperability. The goal of this part of IEC 60870 is to enable unambiguous
    and standardised evaluation of IEC 60870-5 companion standard protocol implementations.
    The guidelines and conditions for the testing environment are described in IEC
    60870-5-6. This new edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- resolving ambiguities and inconsistencies
    between IEC 0870-5-101:2003 and IEC TS 60870-5-601:2006;<br />\r\n- enhancements
    and optimisation of test cases which are needed to prove conformance with IEC
    60870-5-101:2003.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction
    with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/3743\">IEC 60870-5-101:2003</a>"
