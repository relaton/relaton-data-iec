  content: IEC PAS 61076-2-010:2020 specifies circular connectors with a push-pull
    locking mechanism of a size derived from and thus being compatible with M12 screw-locking
    connectors (free connectors with screw-locking according to IEC 61076-2-101, IEC
    61076-2-109, IEC 61076­2­111 or IEC 61076-2-113 are compatible to push-pull fixed
    interfaces according to this document) and with mating interfaces according to
    IEC 61076-2-101, IEC 61076-2-109, IEC 61076-2-111 or IEC 61076-2-113.
