abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18047-6 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (tags and interrogators) for
    item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-61, ISO/IEC 18000-62,
    ISO/IEC 18000-63 and ISO/IEC 18000-64, but does not apply to the testing of conformity
    with regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The test methods require only that
    the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented, are
    verified. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further,
    application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general
    case.</p><p>The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC 18047-6
    are the following:</p><p>- type-specific conformance parameters including nominal
    values and tolerances;</p><p>- parameters that apply directly affecting system
    functionality and inter-operability.</p><p>Parameters that are already included
    in regulatory test requirements are not included in ISO/IEC 18047-6.</p><p>Unless
    otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 18047-6 are intended to be applied exclusively
    to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-61, ISO/IEC 18000-62,
    ISO/IEC 18000-63 and ISO/IEC 18000-64.</p>"
