abstract:
- content: Contains general information and definitions on the test method to evaluate
    the immunity of integrated circuits (ICs) against fast conducted synchronous transient
    disturbances.The objective is to describe general conditions to obtain a quantitative
    measure of immunity of ICs establishing a uniform testing environment. Critical
    parameters that are expected to influence the test results are described. Deviations
    from this specification should be explicitly noted in the individual test report.
    This synchronous transient immunity measurement method uses short impulses with
    fast rise times of different amplitude, duration and polarity in a conductive
    mode to the IC. In this method, the applied impulse has to be synchronized with
    the activity of the IC to make sure that controlled and reproducible conditions
    can be assured
