abstract:
- content: "IEC 62623:2012 covers personal computing products. It applies to desktop
    and notebook computers as defined in 4.1 that are marketed as final products and
    that are hereafter referred to as the equipment under test (EUT) or product. This
    standard specifies:<br />\r\n- a test procedure to enable the measurement of the
    power and/or energy consumption in each of the EUT's power modes;<br />\r\n- formulas
    for calculating the typical energy consumption (TEC) for a given period (normally
    annual);<br />\r\n- a majority profile that should be used with this standard
    which enables conversion of average power into energy within the TEC formulas;<br
    />\r\n- a system of categorisation enabling like for like comparisons of energy
    consumption between EUTs and a pre-defined format for the presentation of results.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not set any pass/fail criteria for the EUTs. Users of
    the test results should define such criteria. Keywords: Power consumption, Desktop
    computer, Notebook computer"
