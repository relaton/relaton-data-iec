    <p>ISO/IEC 28360:2015 specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of Analyte from ICT &amp; CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC). </p>
    <p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p>
    <p>This International Standard includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PC's. Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables (e.g. paper).</p>
    <p>Examples of EUT that do not use consumables are: </p>
    <p>·         Monitors and TV sets (CRT, Plasma, LCD, Rear projector, Beamer).</p>
    <p>·         Video (VCR, DVD Player/Recorder, Camcorder).</p>
    <p>·         SAT Receiver (Set-Top Box).</p>
    <p>·         Audio units (CD Player/Recorder, Home theatre Systems, Audio Home Systems, Micro-/Mini, Midi Systems, Amplifier, Receiver).</p>
    <p>·         Portable Audio (CD Player, MP 3 Player, Radio recorder, Clock radio etc).</p>
    <p>·         Computer (desktop, tower, server), portable computers (Notebooks).</p>
    <p>Emission rates from EUT using consumables may also be determined according to additional requirements identified by "RAL-UZ 171 Option". </p>
    <p>Calculations use the generalised model and approximations thereof as developed in Annex C. </p>
    <p>The emission rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same class.</p>
    <p>Predictions of "real indoor" <i>concentrations</i> from the determined <i>emission</i> <i>rates</i> are outside the scope of this International Standard.</p>
