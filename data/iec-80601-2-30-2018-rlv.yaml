  content: "IEC 80601-2-30:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 80601-2-30:2018
    applies to the basic safety and essential performance of automated sphygmomanometers,
    hereafter referred to as ME equipment, which by means of an inflatable cuff, are
    used for non continuous indirect estimation of the blood pressure without arterial
    puncture. This document specifies requirements for the basic safety and essential
    performance for this ME equipment and its accessories, including the requirements
    for the accuracy of a determination. This document covers automatic electrically-powered
    ME equipment used for the intermittent, indirect estimation of the blood pressure
    without arterial puncture, including blood pressure monitors for the home healthcare
    environment. Requirements for indirect estimation of the blood pressure without
    arterial puncture ME equipment with an electrically-powered pressure transducer
    and/or displays used in conjunction with a stethoscope or other manual methods
    for determining blood pressure (non-automated sphygmomanometers) are specified
    in document ISO 81060-1. If a clause or subclause is specifically intended to
    be applicable to ME equipment only, or to ME systems only, the title and content
    of that clause or subclause will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or
    subclause applies both to ME equipment and to ME systems, as relevant. Hazards
    inherent in the intended physiological function of ME equipment or ME systems
    within the scope of this document are not covered by specific requirements in
    this document except in 201.11 and 201.105.3.3, as well as 7.2.13 and 8.4.1 of
    IEC 60601-1:2005. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2009 and Amendment 1:2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC
    60601-1-8:2006/AMD1:2012 , and with IEC 60601-1-2:2014 and IEC 60601-1-11:2015;<br
    />\r\nb) referencing IEC 60601-1-10:2007 and IEC 60601-1-12;<br />\r\nc) changing
    an operator-accessible cuff-sphygmomanometer connector from not compatible with
    the ISO 594 series to compatible with the ISO 80369 series;<br />\r\nd) added
    additional requirements for public self-use sphygmomanometers;<br />\r\ne) added
    a list of primary operating functions."
