abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62396-4:2008(E) is intended to provide guidance on atmospheric radiation
    effects on high voltage (nominally above 200 V) avionics electronics used in aircraft
    operating at altitudes up to 60 000 ft (18,3 km). To be used in conjunction with
    IEC/TS 62396-1. Defines the effects of that environment on high voltage electronics
    and provides design considerations for the accommodation of those effects within
    avionics systems. Is intended to help aerospace equipment manufacturers and designers
    to standardise their approach to single event effects on high voltage avionics
    by providing guidance, leading to a standard methodology.
