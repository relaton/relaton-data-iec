  content: "IEC 60747-5-4:2022 specifies the terminology, the essential ratings and
    characteristics as well as the measuring methods of semiconductor lasers.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- References for the terms and definitions related
    to the lighting area, IEC 60050-845, are revised based on IEC 60050-845:2020;<br
    />\r\n- Emission angle is changed to radiation angle in 3.3.2;<br />\r\n- Definitions
    of rise time and fall time in 3.4.1 are revised based on the publication IEC 60050-521:2002;<br
    />\r\n- Spectral linewidth is added to Table 1 in Clause 4;<br />\r\n- Conditions
    for carrier-to-noise ratio of Table 1 in Clause 4 is amended.<br />\r\n- Error
    in the equation for carrier-to-noise ratio in 5.2.2 is corrected;<br />\r\n- Precaution
    against the equipment used for carrier-to-noise ratio measurement is added in
    5.2.2;<br />\r\n- Explanation for the measurement method of the small signal cut-off
    frequency in 5.3.2 of the first edition is deleted because it has been defined
    in the latest version of ISO 11554;<br />\r\n- Reference document for the lifetime
    in 5.4 is amended;<br />\r\n- Precaution against the measuring arrangement used
    for the half-intensity width and 1/e2-intensity is added in 5.5.3;<br />\r\n-
    Reference tables in Annex A, Annex B and Annex C are revised by following the
    latest version of ISO publications."
