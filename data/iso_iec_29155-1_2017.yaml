abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29155-1:2017 identifies a framework for information technology
    (IT) project performance benchmarking (e.g. development or maintenance productivity)
    and related aspects (e.g. data collection and software classification).</p><p>The
    framework consists of activities and components that are necessary to successfully
    identify, define, select, apply, and improve benchmarking for IT project performance.
    It also provides definitions for IT project performance benchmarking terms, which
    are also applicable to other parts of the ISO/IEC 29155 series.</p><p>The target
    audience of this document are stakeholders of IT project performance benchmarking.</p><p>NOTE
    The following are examples of how this document can be used:</p><p>- by a benchmarking
    service provider who wants to align their benchmarking process to be consistent
    with this document;</p><p>- by a benchmarking user (or third-party agents) for
    evaluating the performance of an IT project;</p><p>- by an organization internally
    to answer specific information needs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29155-1:2017 does not cover
    how to organize benchmarking. It is out of the scope of this document to prescribe
    the name, format, or explicit content of the documentation to be produced from
    the benchmarking process.</p>"
