abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29155-1:2017 identifies a framework for information technology
    (IT) project performance benchmarking (e.g. development or maintenance productivity)
    and related aspects (e.g. data collection and software classification).<br />\r\nThe
    framework consists of activities and components that are necessary to successfully
    identify, define, select, apply, and improve benchmarking for IT project performance.
    It also provides definitions for IT project performance benchmarking terms, which
    are also applicable to other parts of the ISO/IEC 29155 series.<br />\r\nThe target
    audience of this document are stakeholders of IT project performance benchmarking.<br
    />\r\nNOTE The following are examples of how this document can be used:<br />\r\n-
    by a benchmarking service provider who wants to align their benchmarking process
    to be consistent with this document;<br />\r\n- by a benchmarking user (or third-party
    agents) for evaluating the performance of an IT project;<br />\r\n- by an organization
    internally to answer specific information needs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29155-1:2017
    does not cover how to organize benchmarking. It is out of the scope of this document
    to prescribe the name, format, or explicit content of the documentation to be
    produced from the benchmarking process."
