abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60601-4-1:2017(E) is intended to help a manufacturer through the
    key decisions and steps to be taken to perform a detailed risk management and
    usability engineering processes for medical electrical equipment or a medical
    electrical system, hereafter referred to as MEE or MES, employing a degree of
    autonomy (DOA).<br />\r\nThis document provides a definition of DOA of MEE or
    MES and a medical robot, and also provides guidance on:<br />\r\n- methodologies
    to perform the risk management process and usability engineering for an MEE or
    MES with a DOA;<br />\r\n- considerations of basic safety and essential performance
    for an MEE and MES with a DOA; and<br />\r\n- identifying the use of DOA, and
    similar concepts in existing ISO/IEC standards dealing with MEE or MES with the
    goal to facilitate alignment of standards by consistent use of the concept of
    DOA; and<br />\r\n- distinguishing between medical robots, and other MEE and MES.<br
    />\r\nUnless specified otherwise, this document considers MEE and MES together.<br
    />\r\nThe manufacturer of an MEE or MES with a DOA is expected to design and manufacture
    an MEE or MES that fulfils its intended use and does not have unacceptable risk
    throughout its life-cycle.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance to help the
    manufacturer in complying with the requirements of IEC 60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012
    for MEE and MES with DOA. The document is also intended as guidance for future
    standard writers.<br />\r\nThere are no prerequisites to this document."
