  content: "IEC 62271-212:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62271-212;2022
    specifies the service conditions, rated characteristics, general structural requirements
    and test methods of the assemblies of the main electrical functional units of
    a high-voltage transformer substation, duly interconnected, for AC voltages up
    to and including 52 kV on the high-voltage side and service frequency 50 Hz or
    60 Hz. The CEADS is cable‑connected to the high-voltage network for indoor and
    outdoor applications of restricted access. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- clause numbering aligned with IEC 62271-1:2017,<br
    />\r\n- rewording of title and scope of the document,<br />\r\n- implement changes
    on internal arc definition and testing following the evolution of prefabricated
    substation concept according to IEC 62271-202,<br />\r\n- general review of main
    test procedures such as temperature rise or dielectric test on interconnections,
    considering control equipment, communication, smart grid devices and integration
    of components,<br />\r\n- general review of installation, operation, safety and
    maintenance requirements."
