abstract:
- content: Aims at evaluating the moisture resistance of nonhermetic packaged solid
    state devices. Employs severe conditions of pressure, humidity and temperature
    that accelerate the penetration of moisture through the external protective material
    or along the interface between the external protective material and the metallic
    conductors that pass through it.
