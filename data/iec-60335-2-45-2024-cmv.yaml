  content: "IEC 60335-2-45:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-45:2024 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-45:2002+AMD1:2008+AMD2:2011
    CSV edition 3.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-45:2024 deals with the safety of portable
    electric heating tools and similar appliances, their rated voltage being not more
    than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use, but which
    nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended
    to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. Appliances that can also be used when mounted on a
    support are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances
    that are within the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n– branding tools;<br />\r\n–
    burning-in pens;<br />\r\n– conduit-soldering tools;<br />\r\n– dehorning tools;<br
    />\r\n– desoldering irons;<br />\r\n– firelighters;<br />\r\n– glue guns;<br />\r\n–
    heat guns;<br />\r\n– household film-welding appliances;<br />\r\n– paint strippers;<br
    />\r\n– plastic-cutting tools;<br />\r\n– soldering guns;<br />\r\n– soldering
    irons;<br />\r\n– stripping pliers;<br />\r\n– thermoplastic conduit-welding tools.<br
    />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances which are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not in general take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including
    children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience
    and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision
    or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n–
    in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– hand-held
    motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745 series, IEC 62841 series);<br />\r\n–
    transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 61029 series, IEC 62841 series);<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n–
    tools using high-frequency heating other than induction soldering irons;<br />\r\n–
    arc-welding equipment.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2011. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion or conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 15.101, 22.105, 25.7);<br />\r\nc) introduction
    of external accessible surfaces temperature limits, including addition of functional
    surface and hot surface requirements (3.6.101, 7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.14, 7.15, 11.3,
    11.8);<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
