abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000 defines the operation of radio frequency identification
    (RFID) air interfaces for item identification and management.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18000 has been designed to encompass a full range of data capture and carrier
    functionality. Both read and write operations are enabled, and the interfaces
    can efficiently support both simple and complex data transactions.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    approach facilitates user implementation by providing consistency between differing
    types of RFID data transactions. Equally it provides architecture to guide future
    RFID development whilst maintaining the backward compatibility necessary to sustain
    market confidence.<br /><br />\r\nRecent developments in the design and management
    of distributed databases holding item level information have focused attention
    on 'identification data element' operation of RFID systems. In this application,
    the RFID tag carries only sufficient data to permit reference to attribute information
    held elsewhere. Typically this data does not change during the validity of the
    'licence' and is of relatively low bit count.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 24710:2005
    has been prepared to assist users intending to implement ISO/IEC 18000 RFID air
    interface standards, with particular focus on so-called elementary tags, i.e.
    tags possessing limited memory - typically but not exclusively 256 bits or less
    - and lacking write capability (but not excluding WORM devices).<br /><br />\r\nThe
    annexes to ISO/IEC TR 24710:2005 describe the implementation of ISO/IEC 18000-2,
    -3, -4, -6 and -7 in such an application.<br /><br />\r\nUsers are strongly advised
    to refer to ISO/IEC 15961 and ISO/IEC 15962 for a full exposition of the management
    issues relating to data strings used for identification data element purposes.<br
    /><br />\r\nBodies external to ISO also specify identification data element length
    and structure for particular applications.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 24710:2005
    defines for each of ISO/IEC 18000-2, -3, -4, -6 and -7, and, where relevant, for
    each Mode within each part, a transaction that achieves an elementary tag 'identification
    data element' for item identification and management.<br /><br />\r\nThe transaction
    uses the existing air interface protocols defined in the corresponding parts of
    ISO/IEC 18000 or a subset thereof."
