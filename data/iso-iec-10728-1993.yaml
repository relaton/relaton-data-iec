  content: "<p>The services interface specified gives any program full access to all
    IRDS services. Defines the semantics of this interface, and also specifies the
    language bindings for ISO Pascal (ISO 7185). Language bindings for other ISO standard
    programming languages are provided as separate standards. Makes no assumptions
    about an implementation environment, and assumes no specific run-time or compile
    time interfaces. Details of the IRDS series of standards are to be found in ISO/IEC
    10027.</p>"
