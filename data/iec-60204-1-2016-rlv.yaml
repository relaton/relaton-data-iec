  content: "IEC 60204-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60204-1:2016 applies
    to electrical, electronic and programmable electronic equipment and systems to
    machines not portable by hand while working, including a group of machines working
    together in a co-ordinated manner. The equipment covered by this part of IEC 60204
    commences at the point of connection of the supply to the electrical equipment
    of the machine. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published
    in 2005. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    added requirements to address applications involving power drive systems (PDS);<br
    />\r\n- revised electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements;<br />\r\n- clarified
    overcurrent protection requirements;<br />\r\n- requirements for determination
    of the short circuit current rating of the electrical equipment;<br />\r\n- revised
    protective bonding requirements and terminology;<br />\r\n- reorganization and
    revision to Clause 9, including requirements pertaining to safe torque off of
    PDS, emergency stop, and control circuit protection;<br />\r\n- revised symbols
    for actuators of control devices;<br />\r\n- revised technical documentation requirements;<br
    />\r\n- general updating to current special national conditions, normative standards,
    and bibliographical references."
