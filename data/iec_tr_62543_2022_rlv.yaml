abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62543:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 62543:2022
    gives general guidance on the subject of voltage sourced converters (VSC) used
    for transmission of power by high voltage direct current (HVDC). It describes
    converters that are not only voltage sourced (containing a capacitive energy storage
    medium and where the polarity of DC voltage remains fixed) but also self-commutated,
    using semiconductor devices which can both be turned on and turned off by control
    action. The scope includes 2‑level and 3-level converters with pulse-width modulation
    (PWM), along with multi-level converters, modular multi-level converters and cascaded
    two-level converters, but excludes 2‑level and 3-level converters operated without
    PWM, in square-wave output mode. HVDC power transmission using voltage sourced
    converters is known as \"VSC transmission\". The various types of circuit that
    can be used for VSC transmission are described in this document, along with their
    principal operational characteristics and typical applications. The overall aim
    is to provide a guide for purchasers to assist with the task of specifying a VSC
    transmission scheme. Line-commutated and current-sourced converters are specifically
    excluded from this document. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- in Clause 3, some redundant
    definitions which were identical to those listed in IEC 62747 have been deleted;<br
    />\r\n- in 4.3.4, description and diagrams have been added for the cases of a
    bipole with dedicated metallic return and a rigid bipole;<br />\r\n- in 4.4, mention
    is made of the bi-mode insulated gate transistor (BiGT) and injection enhanced
    gate transistor (IEGT) as possible alternatives to the IGBT;<br />\r\n- in 5.6,
    the reference to common-mode blocking reactors has been deleted since these are
    very rarely used nowadays."
