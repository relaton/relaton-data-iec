abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 specifies the object identifier (OID) resolution system
    (ORS), including the overall architecture and a DNS-based resolution mechanism.It
    specifies the means for inserting any application-defined information associated
    with an OID node into the domain name system (DNS) and the means of retrieval
    of that information using the ORS.It does not restrict the number of applications
    it can support.It specifies the required operation of an ORS client, including
    the mapping of an OID-IRI (internationalized resource identifier) value by the
    ORS client into a DNS name to produce a DNS query for the specified application
    information and the processing of any returned information. The ORS has no role
    in the allocation or registration of OID nodes.The required behaviour of an ORS
    client is specified, but the interfaces to it are specified only in terms of the
    semantics of the interaction. A bit-level application program interface is platform-
    and software-dependent, and is not in the scope of ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011. It does
    not include a tutorial or complete specification on the management of DNS zone
    files; it specifies (only) the DNS resource records that need to be inserted in
    the zone files in order to support ORS access to the information associated with
    an OID node.ISO/IEC 29168-1:2011 specifies required DNS zone file resource records,
    and prohibits the use of other resource records of a similar form but with different
    semantics (in DNS zone files in the.oid res.org domain). It does not otherwise
    restrict the general use of DNS zone files.
