    <p>For aspects of quality specific to the finger image modality, ISO/IEC TR 29794-4:2010:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>specifies terms and definitions that are useful in the specification, use, and test of finger image quality metrics;</li>
    <li>defines the interpretation of finger image quality scores;</li>
    <li>identifies or defines finger image corpora for the purpose of serving as information for algorithm developers and users;</li>
    <li>develops statistical methodologies specific to finger image corpora for characterizing quality metrics to facilitate interpretation of scores and their relation to matching performance.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Performance assessment of quality algorithms and standardization of quality algorithms are outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 29794-4:2010.</p>
