  content: IEC/TS 60870-5-7:2013(E) describes messages and data formats for implementing
    IEC/TS 62351-5 for secure authentication as an extension to IEC 60870-5-101 and
    IEC 60870-5-104. The purpose of this base standard is to permit the receiver of
    any IEC 60870-5-101/104 Application Protocol Data Unit (APDU) to verify that the
    APDU was transmitted by an authorized user and that the APDU was not modified
    in transit. It provides methods to authenticate not only the device which originated
    the APDU but also the individual human user if that capability is supported by
    the rest of the telecontrol system. This specification is also intended to be
    used, together with the definitions of IEC/TS 62351-3, in conjunction with the
    IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard.
