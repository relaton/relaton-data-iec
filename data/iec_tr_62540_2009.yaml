abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62540:2009(E) applies to all stationary lead-acid cells and monobloc
    batteries for float charge applications (i.e. permanently connected to a load
    and to a d.c. power supply), in a static location (i.e. not generally intended
    to be moved from place to place) and incorporated into stationary equipment or
    installed in battery rooms for use in telecom, uninterruptible power supply (UPS),
    utility switching, emergency power or similar applications. These batteries are
    covered by IEC 60896-11, IEC 60896-21 and IEC 60896-22.
