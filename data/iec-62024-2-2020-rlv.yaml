  content: "IEC 62024-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62024-2:2020 specifies
    the measuring methods of the rated direct current limits for small inductors.
    Standardized measuring methods for the determination of ratings enable users to
    accurately compare the current ratings given in various manufacturers’ data books.
    This document is applicable to leaded and surface mount inductors with dimensions
    according to IEC 62025-1 and generally with rated current less than 22 A, although
    inductors with rated current greater than 22 A are available that fall within
    the dimension restrictions of this document (no larger than a 12 mm x 12 mm footprint
    approximately). These inductors are typically used in DC-to-DC converters built
    on PCBs, for electric and telecommunication equipment, and small size switching
    power supply units. The measuring methods are defined by the saturation and temperature
    rise limitations induced solely by direct current. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    addition of Table 2 and Figure 2 b).</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
