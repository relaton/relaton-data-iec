  content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14543-4-301:2020 specifies an application-layer protocol necessary
    for ensuring interoperability among the products of various manufacturers regarding
    communications between home air conditioners and controllers, using a protocol
    called network enhanced communications device (NECD) as specified in ISO&#x2F;IEC
    14543-4-3. This protocol is based on user datagram protocol (UDP) using IPv4 or
    IPv6 (TCP is optional).
