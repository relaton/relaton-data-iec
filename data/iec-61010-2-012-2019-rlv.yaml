  content: "IEC 61010-2-012:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61010-2-012:2019
    specifies safety requirements for electrical equipment and its accessories within
    the categories a) through c), wherever it is intended to be used, whenever that
    equipment incorporates one or more of the following characteristics:<br />\r\n–
    A refrigerating system that is acted on or impacted by an integral heating function
    such that the combined heating and refrigerating system generates additional and/or
    more severe hazards than those for the two systems if treated separately.<br />\r\n–
    The materials being treated in the intended application introduce significant
    heat into the refrigerating system, so that the refrigerating system in the application
    yields additional and/or more severe hazards than those for the refrigerating
    system if operated at the maximum rated ambient temperature alone.<br />\r\n–
    An irradiation function for the materials being treated presenting additional
    hazards.<br />\r\n– A function to expose the materials being treated to excessive
    humidity, carbon dioxide, salt mist, or other substances which can result in additional
    hazards.<br />\r\n– A function of mechanical movement presenting additional hazards.<br
    />\r\n– Provision for an operator to walk in to the operating area to load or
    unload the materials being treated.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety
    publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with changes introduced
    by Amendment 1 of IEC 61010-1:2010;<br />\r\nb) changes related to the use of
    small capitals for defined terms only;<br />\r\nc) clarifications for cooling
    tests in 4.4.2.10;<br />\r\nd) requirements for overtemperature protection in
    10.101, including deletion of the second part of the sentence in item b), and
    the deletion of item c);<br />\r\ne) changes pertaining to the accurate employment
    of terms \"temperature\", \"operating temperature\", \"working temperature\",
    \"application temperature\", \"room temperature\" and \"ambient temperature\"
    in 3.5.104, 3.5.105, 4.3.1, 4.3.2, 5.4.2, 8.2.1, 8.2.2, 11.7.2.101.2, 11.7.2.101.3,
    13.2.102, 14.102, 15.101, 15.102, 15.103, Introduction and many other locations.
    For the purpose of clarification, the definition of 3.5.114, controlled temperature,
    is added.</p>"
