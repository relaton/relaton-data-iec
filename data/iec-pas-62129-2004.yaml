  content: Provides procedures for calibrating an optical spectrum analyzer designed
    to measure the power distribution of an optical spectrum; this analyzer is equiped
    with an input port for use with a fibre-optic connector. This document applies
    to optical spectrum analyzers developed for use in fibre-optic communications
    and is limited to equipment that can directly measure the optical spectrum output
    from an optical fibre, where the optical fibre is connected to an input port installed
    in the optical spectrum analyzer through a fibre-optic connector.
