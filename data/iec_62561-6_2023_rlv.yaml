abstract:
- content: "IEC 62561-6:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62561-6:2023
    specifies the requirements and tests for devices intended to count the number
    of lightning strikes based on the current flowing in a conductor. This conductor
    can be part of a lightning protection system (LPS) or connected to an SPD installation
    or other conductors, which are not intended to conduct a significant portion of
    lightning currents. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) a new classification according to the internal circuit of
    LSCs has been added;<br />\r\nb) the tests flowchart in Annex C has been updated
    to reflect this new classification;<br />\r\nc) the applicability of previous
    tests has been added (Annex D)."
