abstract:
- content: "CISPR 15:2018+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to the emission (radiated and conducted)
    of radiofrequency disturbances from:<br />\r\n- lighting equipment (3.3.16);<br
    />\r\n- the lighting part of multi-function equipment where this lighting part
    is a primary function;<br />\r\n- UV and IR radiation equipment for residential
    and non-industrial applications;<br />\r\n- advertising signs;<br />\r\n- decorative
    lighting;<br />\r\n- emergency signs.<br />\r\nExcluded from the scope of this
    document are:<br />\r\n- components or modules intended to be built into lighting
    equipment and which are not user-replaceable;<br />\r\n- lighting equipment operating
    in the ISM frequency bands (as defined in Resolution 63 (1979) of the ITU Radio
    Regulation);<br />\r\n- lighting equipment for aircraft and airfield facilities
    (runways, service facilities, platforms);<br />\r\n- video signs;<br />\r\n- installations;<br
    />\r\n- equipment for which the electromagnetic compatibility requirements in
    the radio-frequency range are explicitly formulated in other CISPR standards,
    even if they incorporate a built-in lighting function.<br />\r\nThe frequency
    range covered is 9 kHz to 400 GHz. No measurements need to be performed at frequencies
    where no limits are specified in this document.<br />\r\nMulti-function equipment
    which is subjected simultaneously to different clauses of this document and/or
    other standards need to meet the provisions of each clause/standard with the relevant
    functions in operation.<br />\r\nFor equipment outside the scope of this document
    and which includes lighting as a secondary function, there is no need to separately
    assess the lighting function against this document, provided that the lighting
    function was operative during the assessment in accordance with the applicable
    standard. The radiated emission requirements in this document are not intended
    to be applicable to the intentional transmissions from a radio transmitter as
    defined by the ITU, nor to any spurious emissions related to these intentional
    transmissions.<br />\r\nWithin the remainder of this document, wherever the term
    \"lighting equipment\" or \"EUT\" is used, it is meant to be the electrical lighting
    and similar equipment falling in the scope of this document as specified in this
    clause. This ninth edition cancels and replaces the eighth edition published in
    2013 and its Amendment 1:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) full editorial revision and restructuring;<br
    />\r\nb) the restriction to mains and battery operation is deleted in the scope;<br
    />\r\nc) radiated disturbance limits in the frequency range 300 MHz to 1 GHz have
    been introduced;<br />\r\nd) the load terminals limits and the CDNE (alternative
    to radiated emissions) limits have changed;<br />\r\ne) deletion of the insertion-loss
    requirements and the associated Annex A;<br />\r\nf) introduction of three basic
    ports: wired network ports, local wired ports and the enclosure port;<br />\r\ng)
    introduction of a more technology-independent approach;<br />\r\nh) replacement
    of Annex B (CDNE) by appropriate references to CISPR 16-series of standards;<br
    />\r\ni) modified requirements for the metal holes of the conical housing;<br
    />\r\nj) new conducted disturbance measurement method for GU10 self-ballasted
    lamp;<br />\r\nk) addition of current probe measurement method and limits for
    various types of ports (in addition to voltage limits and measurement methods);<br
    />\r\nl) introduction of the term ‘module’ (instead of independent auxiliary)
    and requirements for measurement of modules using a host (reference) system;<br
    />\r\nm) modified specifications for stabilization times of EUTs;<br />\r\nn)
    for large EUT (> 1,6 m), addition of the magnetic field measurement method using
    a 60 cm loop antenna at 3 m distance (method from CISPR 14-1) as an alternative
    to the 3 m and 4 m LAS.<br />\r\nKeywords: emission (radiated and conducted) of
    radiofrequency disturbance<br />\r\nThe contents of the Interpretation Sheet 1
    of November 2019 have been included in this copy."
