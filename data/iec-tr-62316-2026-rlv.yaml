  content: "IEC TR 62316:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 62316:2026
    which is a Technical report, provides guidance on the interpretation of backscattering
    traces, as obtained by traditional optical time domain reflectometers (OTDRs)
    for single-mode fibres. This document does not cover Polarization OTDRs. Also,
    backscattered power effects are discussed in case of unidirectional trace. Full
    description of the test measurement procedure can be found in Annex C of IEC 60793‑1‑40:2024.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2017.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) update of the fibre types;<br />\r\nb) addition of information as regards
    attenuation uniformity."
