abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165-372:2011(E) is intended to document interoperability
    behaviour for Fabric elements (i.e., E_Port, F_Port, FL_Port). It includes a wide
    range of issues such as link initialization, error detection, error recovery,
    fabric operation, management capabilities, and zoning. It serves as an implementation
    guide, whose primary objective is to maximize the likelihood of interoperability
    between conforming implementations. It specifies common methodologies for both
    Arbitrated Loop and Switched environments. The goal of this technical report is
    to facilitate interoperability between devices whether they are connected in a
    loop or Fabric topology.
