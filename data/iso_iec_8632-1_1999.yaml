abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    8632-1:1999 provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval of picture
    description information. The file format consists of an ordered set of elements
    that may be used to describe pictures in a way that is compatible between systems
    of different architectures, compatible with devices of differing capabilities
    and design, and meaningful to application constituencies. This picture description
    includes the capability for describing static images.<br />\r\nThe elements specified
    provide for the representation of a wide range of pictures on a wide range of
    graphical devices. The elements are organized into groups that delimit major structures
    (metafiles, pictures, and application structures), that specify the representations
    used within the metafile, that control the display of the picture, that perform
    basic drawing actions, that control the attributes of the basic drawing actions,
    that allow application-specific structuring to be overlaid on the graphical content,
    and that provide access to non-standard device capabilities.<br />\r\nThe metafile
    is defined in such a way that, in addition to sequential access to the whole metafile,
    random access to individual pictures and individual context-independent application
    structures is well-defined. Applications which require random access to pictures
    and/or context-independent application structures within pictures may, within
    the metafile, define directories to these pictures and/or context-independent
    application structures. The metafile may then be opened and randomly accessed
    without interpreting the entire metafile.<br />\r\nIn addition to a functional
    specification, two standard encodings of the metafile syntax are specified. These
    encodings address the needs of applications that require small metafile size plus
    minimum effort to generate and interpret, and maximum flexibility for a human
    reader or editor of the metafile.<br />\r\nThis part of ISO/IEC 8632 describes
    the format using an abstract syntax. The remaining parts of ISO 8632 specify standardized
    encodings that conform to this syntax: ISO/IEC 8632-3 specifies a binary encoding;
    ISO/IEC 8632-4 specifies a clear text encoding."
