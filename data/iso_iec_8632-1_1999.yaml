abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 8632 provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval
    of picture description information. The file</p><p>format consists of an ordered
    set of elements that may be used to describe pictures in a way that is compatible</p><p>between
    systems of different architectures, compatible with devices of differing capabilities
    and design, and</p><p>meaningful to application constituencies. This picture description
    includes the capability for describing static</p><p>images.</p><p>The elements
    specified provide for the representation of a wide range of pictures on a wide
    range of graphical</p><p>devices. The elements are organized into groups that
    delimit major structures (metafiles, pictures, and application</p><p>structures),
    that specify the representations used within the metafile, that control the display
    of the picture, that</p><p>perform basic drawing actions, that control the attributes
    of the basic drawing actions, that allow application-specific</p><p>structuring
    to be overlaid on the graphical content, and that provide access to non-standard
    device capabilities.</p><p>The metafile is defined in such a way that, in addition
    to sequential access to the whole metafile, random access to</p><p>individual
    pictures and individual context-independent application structures is well-defined.
    Applications which</p><p>require random access to pictures and/or context-independent
    application structures within pictures may, within the</p><p>metafile, define
    directories to these pictures and/or context-independent application structures.
    The metafile may</p><p>then be opened and randomly accessed without interpreting
    the entire metafile.</p><p>In addition to a functional specification, two standard
    encodings of the metafile syntax are specified. These</p><p>encodings address
    the needs of applications that require small metafile size plus minimum effort
    to generate and</p><p>interpret, and maximum flexibility for a human reader or
    editor of the metafile.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 8632 describes the format using
    an abstract syntax. The remaining parts of ISO 8632 specify</p><p>standardized
    encodings that conform to this syntax: ISO/IEC 8632-3 specifies a binary encoding;
    ISO/IEC 8632-4</p><p>specifies a clear text encoding.</p>"
