abstract:
- content: 'This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 11518 defines the control for HIPPI physical
    layer switches. HIPPI by itself is an efficient simplex high-performance point-to-point
    interface. The physical switch control allows the interconnection of multiple
    HIPPI based equipments with HIPPI physical layer switches. Characteristics of
    this HIPPI physical switch control protocol include: - support for both source
    routing and destination addresses; - I-Fields and CCIs can span multiple physical
    layer switches within a fabric; - when a Destination end-point receives a packet,
    it can easily manipulate the I-Field received to return a reply packet to the
    Source; - support for physical layer switches with differing numbers of ports,
    all within the same fabric; - specified reserved addresses to aid address self-discovery,
    switch management, and switch control. The purpose of this part of ISO&#x2F;IEC
    11518 is to facilitate the development and use of the HIPPI in computer systems
    by providing common physical switch control. It provides switch control structures
    for physical layer switches interconnecting computers, high-performance display
    systems, and high-performance, intelligent block-transfer peripherals. This part
    of ISO&#x2F;IEC 11518 also applies to point-to-point HIPPI topologies.'
