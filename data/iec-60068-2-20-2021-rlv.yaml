  content: "IEC 60068-2-20:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60068-2-20:2021 outlines
    Tests Ta and Tb, applicable to devices with leads and leads themselves. Soldering
    tests for surface mounting devices (SMD) are described in IEC 60068‑2‑58. This
    document provides procedures for determining the solderability and resistance
    to soldering heat of devices in applications using solder alloys, which are eutectic
    or near eutectic tin lead (Pb), or lead-free alloys. The procedures in this document
    include the solder bath method and soldering iron method. The objective of this
    document is to ensure that component lead or termination solderability meets the
    applicable solder joint requirements of IEC 61191-3 and IEC 61191-4. In addition,
    test methods are provided to ensure that the component body can be resistant to
    the heat load to which it is exposed during soldering. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- update of and clarification of pre-conditioning (former \"aging\") and
    its relation to natural aging.</p>"
