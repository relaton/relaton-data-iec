abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 23005-4:2011 provides syntax and semantics of description schemes
    and descriptors used to characterize a virtual world object related metadata to
    provide the interoperability between virtual worlds and/or control a virtual world
    object in a virtual world by real world devices, which are various types of user
    interaction devices, including sensors.  ISO/IEC 23005-4:2011 includes an XML
    Schema, called Virtual World Object Characteristics XSD, for describing an object
    by considering three main requirements:    it should be possible to easily create
    importers/exporters from various VE implementations;   it should be easy to control
    an object within a VE; and   it should be possible to modify a proprietary template
    (specific to the virtual world) of the object by using data contained in Virtual
    World Object Characteristics file.     The schema of ISO/IEC 23005-4:2011 deals
    only with metadata and does not include representations of geometry, sound, scent,
    animation or texture. To represent the latter, references to media resources are
    used.'
