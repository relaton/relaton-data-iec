  content: "IEC 61291-2:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61292-2:2023
    provides a performance specification template applicable to optical amplifiers
    (OAs) used in single channel applications. Multichannel applications are covered
    in IEC 61291-4. The objective of this template is to provide a framework for the
    preparation of performance standards and/or product specifications defining the
    performance of OA devices used in single channel applications. In addition to
    the requirements specified in this template, a performance standard or product
    specification could include other parameters, such as ratings, operating conditions,
    tests, and pass/fail criteria. For a particular application, product specification
    writers could add specification parameters and/or groups of specification parameters
    to this template, without removing the parameters specified in this document.
    This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2016.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    the test methods for gain ripple in Table 2, Table 4 and Table 6 refer now to
    the IEC 61290‑1 series;<br />\r\n- the SOA definition (3.1.3) refers now to IEC
    61931."
