abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62474-1:2022 is a guidance document to help organizations properly
    implement IEC 62474. These organizations can be the ones creating tools for material
    data exchange and those who submit and receive material declarations.<br />\r\nThis
    document supports consistent implementation of IEC 62474, including how the procedures,
    content, and form relating to material declarations for products can be further
    specified. It also illustrates how to apply IEC 62474 to non-electrotechnical
    industries.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n• illustrates the flexibility and
    functionality of the IEC 62474 standard including examples,<br />\r\n• illustrates
    how to achieve conformity with IEC 62474, including guidance on preparing a declaration
    for compliance and a composition declaration, including mandatory and optional
    declaration requirements,<br />\r\n• illustrates how IEC 62474 can be applied
    to non-electrotechnical industries by preparing material declarations using an
    alternate declarable substance list (DSL),<br />\r\n• supports organizations that
    create software to exchange substance and material data to implement IEC 62474
    in their tools, and<br />\r\n• supports users that submit and receive material
    declarations.<br />\r\nFollowing the IEC 62474 standard scope, process chemicals,
    emissions during product use and product packaging material are not in the scope
    of this document.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62474-1:2022 cancels and replaces IEC TR 62474-1:2015.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to IEC TR 62474-1:2015:<br />\r\na) IEC TR 62474-1:2015 was revised and converted
    to a Technical Specification in accordance with the requirements of the ISO/IEC
    Directives;<br />\r\nb) the introduction and scope have been updated to better
    align with the requirements of IEC 62474:2018;<br />\r\nc) by defining an authority,
    list identity and list version, the standard data exchange format can be used
    for lists other than the IEC 62474 database;<br />\r\nd) two types of material
    declarations, declaration for compliance and composition declaration, and their
    requirements are defined;<br />\r\ne) the material classes and exemption list
    capabilities have been improved;<br />\r\nf) guidance is provided on how to use
    data fields in the declaration of compliance and composition declaration to collect
    the information required for the European Chemical Agency (ECHA) Substances of
    Concern In articles, as such or in complex objects (Products) (SCIP) database;<br
    />\r\ng) six examples of material declaration are given to show how IEC 62474
    meets various industry needs."
