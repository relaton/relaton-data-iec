    <p>ISO/IEC 30107-3:2017 establishes:</p>
    <p>-      principles and methods for performance assessment of presentation attack detection mechanisms;</p>
    <p>-      reporting of testing results from evaluations of presentation attack detection mechanisms;</p>
    <p>-      a classification of known attack types (in an informative annex).</p>
    <p>Outside the scope are:</p>
    <p>-      standardization of specific PAD mechanisms;</p>
    <p>-      detailed information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing techniques), algorithms, or sensors;</p>
    <p>-      overall system-level security or vulnerability assessment.</p>
    <p>The attacks considered in this document take place at the sensor during presentation. Any other attacks are considered outside the scope of this document.</p>
