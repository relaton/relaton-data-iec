    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29170-1:2017 recommends best practices for coding system evaluation of images and image sequences. ISO/IEC TR 29170-1:2017 defines a common vocabulary of terms for coding system evaluation and divides evaluation methods into three broad categories:</p>
    <p>a)    subjective assessment;</p>
    <p>b)    objective assessment;</p>
    <p>c)    computational assessment.</p>
    <p>In addition to these broad assessment categories, this document discusses special care that is given for coding unusual imagery, e.g. high dynamic range or high colour depth.</p>
    <p>A fourth assessment category, hardware complexity, is often important for real-time or computationally complex applications; however, it is outside the scope of this document.</p>
