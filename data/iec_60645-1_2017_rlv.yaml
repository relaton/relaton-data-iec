abstract:
- content: "IEC 60645-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60645-1:2017
    specifies general requirements for audiometers designed for use in determining
    hearing threshold levels, relative to standard reference threshold levels established
    by means of psychoacoustic test methods, and those designed to perform psychoacoustic
    tests using speech material.<br />\r\nThe object of this standard is to ensure:<br
    />\r\na) that tests of hearing in the frequency range 125 Hz to 16 kHz on a given
    human ear, performed with different pure-tone audiometers which comply with this
    standard, give substantially the same results;<br />\r\nb) that the results obtained
    represent a valid comparison between the hearing of the ear tested and the reference
    threshold of hearing;<br />\r\nc) that a means of presenting speech material to
    a subject in a standardized manner is provided. This will ensure that tests of
    hearing using a specific speech signal and a specific manner of signal presentation,
    when performed with different audiometers which comply with this standard, give
    substantially the same results;<br />\r\nd) that audiometers are classified according
    to the range of test signals they present, according to the mode of operation
    or according to their presumed primary application.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition
    cancels and replaces the third edition, published in 2012, and the first edition
    IEC 60645-2, published in 1993. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition now includes the requirements for both pure-tone (prior edition
    of IEC 60645-1) and speech audiometers (prior edition of IEC 60645-2) into a single
    document. The technical requirements in this edition remain similar to the intent
    of the prior two documents, but now eliminate technical and editorial contradictions
    caused by two separate standards with different review cycles applying to an audiometer."
