    <p>Within the context of the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM®), ISO/IEC TR 29163-4:2009 describes how SCORM® conformant content can be sequenced to the learner through a set of learner or system-initiated navigation events. The branching and flow of that content can be described by a predefined set of activities.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29163-4:2009 covers the essential Learning Management System (LMS) responsibilities for sequencing content objects (Sharable Content Objects [SCOs] or Assets) during run-time and allowing SCOs to indicate navigation requests. In addition, guidance is offered for providing navigation controls to learners. General subjects discussed include the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sequencing Concepts and Terminology (e.g., Learning Activities, Activity Trees, Clusters);</li>
    <li>Sequencing Definition Model (i.e., detailed descriptions and requirements of the sequencing information that can be applied to learning activities);</li>
    <li>Sequencing Behavior Model (i.e., detailed descriptions of LMS behaviors to prescribed sequencing information and learner's experience with learning content);</li>
    <li>Navigation Controls and Requirements;</li>
    <li>Navigation Data Model.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Communication between content and LMSs facilitates use of SCORM® Sequencing and Navigation to present content to learners based on learner choices and performance at run-time. This communication also enables LMSs to track learner completion and progress while content is presented to the learner. ISO/IEC TR 29163-4:2009 describes in detail how sequencing behaviors are applied to track learner progress.</p>
