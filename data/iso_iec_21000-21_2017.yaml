abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21000-21:2017 specifies an ontology for representing contracts
    in the Multimedia Framework formed for the transaction of MPEG-21 Digital Items
    or services related to the MPEG-21 Framework.<br />\r\nMedia Contract Ontology
    (MCO) aims to digitally express agreements made in environments using ISO/IEC
    21000. These agreements are contracts for transactions of content packed as Digital
    Items, as well as for services provided around this content by means of a sematic
    representation.<br />\r\nThe range of contracts under scope are as follows:<br
    />\r\n- contracts about transactions on rights for the exploitation of content
    as MPEG-21 Digital Items;<br />\r\n- contracts about the provision of MPEG-21-based
    services, like delivery, identification, encryption, search and others.<br />\r\nHowever,
    MCO can also be used as electronic format for contracts on the trade of media
    rights beyond the MPEG framework."
