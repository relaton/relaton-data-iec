abstract:
- content: IEC 63180:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV provides a methodology and test procedures
    to be able to declare and verify the detection area for motion detectors using
    passive infrared technology in electronic control devices and appliance switches,
    whether stand-alone (direct control of one or more applications) or as part of
    home and building electronic systems or building automation control systems (HBES/BACS)
    or similar.
