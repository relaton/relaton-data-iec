abstract:
- content: "IEC 62933-5-2:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62933-5-2:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62933-5-2:2020
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 120 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62933-5-2:2025 primarily describes safety aspects for people and,
    where appropriate, safety matters related to the surroundings and living beings
    for grid-connected energy storage systems where an electrochemical storage subsystem
    is used. This document is applicable to the entire life cycle of BESS (from design
    to end of service life management). This document provides further safety provisions
    that arise due to the use of an electrochemical storage subsystem (e.g. battery
    system) in EES systems that are beyond the general safety considerations described
    in IEC 62933-5-1. This document specifies the safety requirements of an \"electrochemical\"
    energy storage system as a \"system\" to reduce the risk of harm or damage caused
    by the hazards of an electrochemical energy storage system due to interactions
    between the subsystems as presently understood."
