  content: 'IEC TS 62257-8-1:2018(E) proposes simple, cheap, comparative tests in
    order to discriminate easily, in a panel of automotive flooded lead-acid batteries,
    the most acceptable model for PV individual electrification systems. It could
    be particularly useful for project implementers to test in laboratories of developing
    countries, the capability of locally made car or truck batteries to be used for
    their project. The tests provided in this document allow assessment of the batteries''
    performances according to the general specification of the project (see IEC TS
    62257-2) and batteries associated with their battery management system (BMS) in
    a short time and with common technical means. They can be performed locally, as
    close as possible to the operating conditions of the real site. The document provides
    also regulations and installation conditions to be complied with in order to ensure
    the life and proper operation of the installations as well as the safety of people
    living in proximity to the installation. This new edition includes the following
    significant technical change with respect to the previous edition: increase of
    the applicable voltage levels and removal of the 100 kW power limit.'
