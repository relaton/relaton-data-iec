abstract:
- content: specifies items to be measured by objective methods, methods of measurement
    together with measuring conditions, processing of the measured data and presentation
    of acquired information for objective assessment of end-to-end quality of audio-video
    communication systems over digital networks. The measurements are supposed to
    be conducted in a double-ended and a full reference. The systems are assumed to
    have electrical interface channels at the input and at the output of audio-video
    signals for objective assessment.
