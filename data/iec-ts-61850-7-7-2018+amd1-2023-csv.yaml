  content: "IEC TS 61850-7-7:2018+AMD1:2023 specifies a way to model the code components
    of IEC 61850 data model (e.g., the tables describing logical nodes, common data
    classes, structured data attributes, and enumerations) in an XML format that can
    be imported and interpreted by tools. The purpose of this document is limited
    to the publication of the XML format which should support the data model part
    of any IEC 61850 related standard.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-05)
    has been included in this copy."
