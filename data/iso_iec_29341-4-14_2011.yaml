abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-4-14:2011(E) The ScheduledRecording service is a UPnP service
    that allows control points to schedule the recording of content. Generally, this
    content is broadcast content, but this specification does not limit itself to
    broadcast content. This service type enables the following functions:<br/> \n-
    Create a recordSchedule.<br/> \n- Browse a list of recordSchedule instances stored
    by the ScheduledRecording service.<br/> \n- Delete a recordSchedule.<br/> \n-
    Browse a list of recordTask instances, stored by the ScheduledRecording service.
    The ScheduledRecording service may create zero or more recordTask instances for
    each recordSchedule. A recordTask represents a discrete recording operation of
    a recordSchedule.<br/> - Enable or disable individual recordTask instances.<br/>
    \n- Enable or disable a recordSchedule.<br/> \n- Receive notifications indicating
    change of recordSchedule or recordTask list.<br/> \nThis device specification
    is compliant with the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture version 1.0.
    It defines a device type referred to herein as ScheduledRecording. This International
    Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-14, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes
    a technical revision."
