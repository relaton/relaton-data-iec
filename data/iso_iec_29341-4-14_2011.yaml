    29341-4-14:2011 The ScheduledRecording service is a UPnP service that allows control
    points to schedule the recording of content. Generally, this content is broadcast
    content, but this specification does not limit itself to broadcast content. This
    service type enables the following functions: - Create a recordSchedule. - Browse
    a list of recordSchedule instances stored by the ScheduledRecording service. -
    Delete a recordSchedule. - Browse a list of recordTask instances, stored by the
    ScheduledRecording service. The ScheduledRecording service may create zero or
    more recordTask instances for each recordSchedule. A recordTask represents a discrete
    recording operation of a recordSchedule. - Enable or disable individual recordTask
    instances. - Enable or disable a recordSchedule. - Receive notifications indicating
    change of recordSchedule or recordTask list. This device specification is compliant
    with the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a
    device type referred to herein as ScheduledRecording. This International Standard
    replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-14, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes
    a technical revision."
