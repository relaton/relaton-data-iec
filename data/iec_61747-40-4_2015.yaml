abstract:
- content: IEC 61747-40-4:2015(E) is a mechanical performance testing procedure for
    cover glass used in electronic flat panel displays in mobile devices. This standard
    is focused on the measurement of as-received surface fracture load via biaxial
    flexure generated by ring-on-ring.
