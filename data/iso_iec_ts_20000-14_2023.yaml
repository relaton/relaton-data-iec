abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides guidance for organizations
    that are establishing or improving a service management system (SMS) by incorporating
    a service integrator. The incorporation of a service integrator is aimed at addressing
    an environment that includes services sourced from multiple service providers.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document specifically focuses on Service Integration
    and Management (SIAM) in the context of an SMS.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The
    intended users of this document include:</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->organizations that need
    to manage multiple service providers within a new or existing SMS according to
    SIAM; and</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->consultants
    and advisors that support an organization during SMS implementation or improvement,
    where a SIAM approach is being adopted.</p><p class="Note">NOTE 1 This document
    is applicable for organizations implementing SIAM in conjunction with SMS. It
    does not limit organizations or individuals from implementing any other management
    and governance model for managing multivendor environments along with SMS.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document is not applicable to organizations that have
    only one service provider.</p><p class="Note">NOTE 2 In SIAM, the term "supplier"
    is not used. Internal and external suppliers are both referred to as “service
    providers”. See 4.2 for further comparison of terminology.</p>'
