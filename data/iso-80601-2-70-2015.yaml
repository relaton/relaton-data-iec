  content: ISO 80601-2-70:2015 is applicable to the basic safety and essential performance
    of sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment, hereafter referred to as me equipment,
    intended to alleviate the symptoms of patients who suffer from obstructive sleep
    apnoea by delivering a therapeutic breathing pressure to the respiratory tract
    of the patient. Sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment is intended for use in
    the home healthcare environment by lay operators as well as in professional healthcare
    institutions. It excludes sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment intended for
    use with neonates. ISO 80601-2-70:2015 is applicable to me equipment or an me
    system intended for those patients who are not dependent on mechanical ventilation.
    ISO 80601-2-70:2015 is not applicable to me equipment or an me system intended
    for those patients who are dependent on mechanical ventilation such as patients
    with central sleep apnoea. ISO 80601-2-70:2015 is also applicable to those accessories
    intended by their manufacturer to be connected to sleep apnoea breathing therapy
    equipment, where the characteristics of those accessories can affect the basic
    safety or essential performance of the sleep apnoea breathing therapy equipment.
