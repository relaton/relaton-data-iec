abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63217:2021 provides a test procedure for evaluating the performance
    of Over Voltage Ride-Through (OVRT) functions in inverters used in utility-interconnected
    photovoltaic (PV) systems.<br />\r\nThis document is most applicable to large
    systems where PV inverters are connected to utility high voltage (HV) distribution
    systems. However, the applicable procedures may also be used for low voltage (LV)
    installations in locations where evolving OVRT requirements include such installations,
    e.g. single-phase or 3-phase systems. This document is for testing of PV inverters,
    though it contains information that may also be useful for testing of a complete
    PV power plant consisting of multiple inverters connected at a single point to
    the utility grid. It further provides a basis for utility-interconnected PV inverters
    numerical simulation and model validation."
