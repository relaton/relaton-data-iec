  content: "IEC 62841-3-4:2016+AMD1:2019+AMD2:2024 CSV applies to transportable bench
    grinders that can be equipped with one or two accessories as follows:<br />\r\n-
    type 1 grinding wheels in accordance with ISO 603-4:1999 with a diameter not exceeding
    310 mm and a thickness not exceeding 55 mm;<br />\r\n- wire brushes with a diameter
    not exceeding 310 mm and a thickness not exceeding 55 mm;<br />\r\n- polishing
    wheels with a diameter not exceeding 310 mm and with a peripheral speed of any
    accessory between 10 m/s and 50 m/s. The attention of National Committees is drawn
    to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need a
    transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication
    in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip
    themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the
    committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally
    not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.<br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/26423\">IEC
    62841-1:2014</a>. The contents of the corrigendum of December 2016 have been included
    in this copy. The contents of the corrigendum 1 (2024-07) have been included in
    this copy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: Bench Grinder, Hand-held tool, Transportable
