abstract:
- content: IEC SRD 62913-1:2019 describes a common approach for IEC technical committees
    to define generic smart grid requirements for further standardization work. It
    uses as input the Use Case methodology defined as part of the IEC 62559 series,
    and provides a more detailed methodology for describing Use Cases and extracting
    requirements from these Use Cases. This is necessary to achieve a consistent and
    homogeneous description of generic requirements for the different areas which
    make up the smart grid environment.
