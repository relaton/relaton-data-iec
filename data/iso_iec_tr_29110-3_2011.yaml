abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 defines the process assessment guidelines and
    conformance requirements needed to meet the purpose of defined VSE Profiles. It
    is applicable to all VSE Profiles and is compatible with ISO/IEC 15504-2.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe possible uses of ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 are as follows.<br />\r\n\tAssessment
    to evaluate the process capabilities. This is when an organization wants an assessment
    execution in order to obtain a process profile of the implemented processes.<br
    />\r\n\tProvider's capability assessment. This is when a customer asks for a third
    party to conduct an assessment in order to obtain a process profile of the implemented
    process by the software development and maintenance provider. The customer chooses
    the processes to be assessed depending on the services to be contracted.<br /><br
    /><br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nThe target audience of ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 is
    primarily those who perform process assessments for VSEs. ISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011
    also contains information that can be useful to developers of assessment methods
    and assessment tools.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-3:2011 is addressed to people
    who have a direct relation with the assessment process based on the VSE Profiles,
    e.g. the assessor and the sponsor of the assessment, who need guidance on ensuring
    that the requirements for performing an assessment have been met."
