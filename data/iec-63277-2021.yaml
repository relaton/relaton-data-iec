  content: "IEC 63277:2021(E) specifies the performance test methods for binary power
    generation systems.<br />\r\nIt defines the normalized test conditions and estimates
    the power generation efficiency of binary power generation systems. It specifies
    the binary power generation systems having heating medium of non-pressurized hot
    water, with a maximum temperature less than 100 °C created by renewable energy
    or wasted heat in the industrial field and cold water as cooling medium. It is
    applied to binary power generation systems with electric power generation capacity
    of less than 100 kW. This document specifies performance testing, the standard
    conditions and the test methods for determining the electric power output and
    power generation efficiency of binary power generation systems. It includes heating
    conditions (temperature, flow rate) and cooling conditions (temperature, flow
    rate)."
