  content: "IEC 63096:2020 provides a catalogue of highly recommended and optional
    security controls graded (see Clause 5 to Clause 20) in line with the security
    degrees defined by IEC 62645. These are intended for nuclear I&C programmable
    digital systems and architecture including related activities (I&C platform development,
    project engineering, operation and maintenance).<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    to be used for designing I&C systems for new NPPs, and modernizing and modifying
    I&C systems for existing NPPs throughout the I&C programmable digital systems
    lifecycle. It may also be applicable to other types of nuclear facilities.<br
    />\r\nThis document addresses the whole scope of nuclear I&C programmable digital
    systems, both safety and non-safety classified. The scope of this document also
    includes sensors, actuators and electrical systems that belong to the I&C control
    loop. It is also applicable to those parts of electrical systems covered by IEC
    63046, which rely on digital programmable technology. For better readability the
    terms “nuclear I&C programmable digital systems”, “I&C system” or “I&C platform”
    used in this document implicitly include electrical systems if the electrical
    system includes a programmable digital systems."
