  content: "IEC TS 60871-2:2014+AMD1:2022 which is a technical specification, applies
    to capacitors according to IEC 60871-1 and gives the requirements for ageing tests
    of these capacitors. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 1999. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition: The overvoltage cycling test has been moved to IEC 60871-1:2014.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nKeywords: ageing tests of capacitors"
