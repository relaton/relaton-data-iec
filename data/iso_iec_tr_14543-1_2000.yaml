abstract:
- content: 'Various electrically controlled devices are used in homes and similar
    environments for many different applications. Examples of such applications are:
    lighting, heating, food preparation, washing, energy management, water control,
    fire alarms, blinds control, different forms of security control and entertainment
    (audio and video). An overview of such applications is given in the Catalogue
    of Applications of the HES (see Informative reference). When several such devices
    are able to interwork via a common internal network (in this document called a
    home network), the resulting total system is called a home control system. When
    a home control system follows all the specifications in the ISO/IEC HES Standards,
    it is called a Home Electronic System (HES).'
