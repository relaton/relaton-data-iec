    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-1:2017 describes an architecture that allows UPnP Telephony devices, services and control points defined in the propoded DCP to be deployed in the home network environment and to enable management of incoming and outgoing telephony calls, messaging, presence information and phone features configuration through UPnP means from devices within the home. </p>
    <p>In order to accommodate the above mentioned goals, the Telephony Architecture defines several UPnP devices and services that can be embedded to the devices defined for telephony. The architecture model describes interaction among the telephony devices, services and control points. The architecture also describes various deployment scenarios. </p>
    <p>The architecture does not describe any interfaces to "service" gateways that will enable non-UPnP entities to interact with the UPnP devices, services and control points physically attached to the home network.</p>
