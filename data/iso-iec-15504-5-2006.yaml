    <p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2006 describes an exemplar Process Assessment Model (PAM), conformant with the ISO/IEC 15504-2 requirements for PAMs. It provides guidance, by way of example, on the nature and structure of PAMs, and on the variety and function of different indicators of process performance and capability. It also provides guidance, through example, on the requirements for conformance of PAMs, and on the approaches for demonstration of conformance.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15504 provides a framework for the assessment of process capability. This framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring, controlling and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution and support of products and services. It is also intended for use by assessors in the performance of process assessment, and by organizations involved in the development of process reference models, process assessment models or process assessment processes.</p>
