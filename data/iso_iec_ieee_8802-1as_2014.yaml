abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-1AS:2014 defines a protocol and procedures for the transport
    of timing over bridged and virtual bridged local area networks. It includes the
    transport of synchronized time, the selection of the timing source (i.e. best
    master), and the indication of the occurrence and magnitude of timing impairments
    (i.e. phase and frequency discontinuities).
