abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18032:2005 specifies methods for generating and testing prime
    numbers. Prime numbers are used in various cryptographic algorithms, mainly in
    asymmetric encryption algorithms and digital signature algorithms.</p><p>Firstly,
    ISO/IEC 18032:2005 specifies methods for testing whether a given number is prime.
    The testing methods included in ISO/IEC 18032:2005 can be divided into two groups:</p><ul><li>Probabilistic
    primality tests, which have a small error probability. All probabilistic tests
    described here may declare a composite to be a prime. One test described here
    may declare a prime to be composite.</li><li>Deterministic methods, which are
    guaranteed to give the right verdict. These methods use so-called primality certificates.</li></ul><p>Secondly,
    ISO/IEC 18032:2005 specifies methods to generate prime numbers. Again, both probabilistic
    and deterministic methods are presented.</p>"
