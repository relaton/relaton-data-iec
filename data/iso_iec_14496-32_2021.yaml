abstract:
- content: "This document describes the reference software and conformance suite for
    the file format documents in MPEG-4 and MPEG-H. Since these documents share a
    lot of technology, their reference software and conformance program are being
    handled together. These documents are: ISO/IEC 14496-12, ISO/IEC 14496-14, ISO/IEC
    14496-15, ISO/IEC 14496-30 and ISO/IEC 23008-12.<br />\r\nThe purpose of the conformance
    suite is to cover the set of valid features that can be exercised in the file
    format. Media conformance is not covered, though of course in order to exercise
    the file format features, media will be stored."
