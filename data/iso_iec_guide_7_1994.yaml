abstract:
- content: The aim of this Guide is to assist technical committees in drafting standards
    in such a way that they are suitable for certification purposes. It must be borne
    in mind that such standards could also be used for other purposes such as in contractual
    documents between buyer and seller and the like. For certification purposes a
    number of aspects with which standards should normally comply, require emphasis.
    These relate to the specific inclusion or exclusion of items in the standard.
    The standard should be prepared in such a manner that easy reference to or use
    of it can be made. For this, specific requirements are given.
