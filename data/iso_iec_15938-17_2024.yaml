abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15938-17:2024 This document specifies Neural Network Coding (NNC)
    as a compressed representation of the parameters/weights of a trained neural network
    and a decoding process for the compressed representation, complementing the description
    of the network topology in existing (exchange) formats for neural networks. It
    establishes a toolbox of compression methods, specifying (where applicable) the
    resulting elements of the compressed bitstream. Most of these tools can be applied
    to the compression of entire neural networks, and some of them can also be applied
    to the compression of differential updates of neural networks with respect to
    a base network. Such differential updates are for example useful when models are
    redistributed after fine-tuning or transfer learning, or when providing versions
    of a neural network with different compression ratios.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not specify a complete protocol for the transmission of neural networks,
    but focuses on compression of network parameters. Only the syntax format, semantics,
    associated decoding process requirements, parameter sparsification, parameter
    transformation methods, parameter quantization, entropy coding method and integration/signalling
    within existing exchange formats are specified, while other matters such as pre-processing,
    system signalling and multiplexing, data loss recovery and post-processing are
    considered to be outside the scope of this document. Additionally, the internal
    processing steps performed within a decoder are also considered to be outside
    the scope of this document; only the externally observable output behaviour is
    required to conform to the specifications of this document."
