abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15051:2003 specifies supplementary service Recall (SS-RE),
    which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>SS-RE
    is a supplementary service which provides for the redirection of a call transferred
    by the served user back to the served user if the call is unanswered. SS-RE is
    only applicable after transfer by join, not after transfer by rerouteing.</p><p>Service
    specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 15051:2003 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of SS-RE. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the supplementary service
    as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the
    functional entities involved in the supplementary service and the information
    flows between them.</p>"
