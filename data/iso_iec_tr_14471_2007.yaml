abstract:
- content: Since CASE (computer aided software engineering) adoption is a subject
    of the broader technology transition problem, ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 addresses
    the adoption practices appropriate for a wide range of computing organizations.
    ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 neither dictates nor advocates particular development standards,
    software processes, design methods, methodologies, techniques, programming languages,
    or life-cycle paradigms.ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 will:identify critical success factors
    (CSF);propose a set of adoption processes;guide successful adoption in consideration
    of organizational and cultural environment.The following groups are targeted as
    potential audiences:CASE users;information systems managers;chief information
    officers (CIO);CASE suppliers;software engineering consultants;those involved
    in the acquisition of CASE tools and technology.Therefore ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007
    addresses aspects of CASE tools adoption. It is best used in conjunction with
    ISO/IEC 14102 for CASE tool evaluation and selection. It is complementary to related
    ISO/IEC documents which deal with the general aspects of these topics.The purpose
    of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 is to provide a recommended practice for CASE adoption.
    It provides guidance in establishing processes and activities that are to be applied
    for the successful adoption of CASE technology. The use of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007
    will help to maximize the return and minimize the risk of investing in CASE technology.
    However, ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 does not establish compliance criteria.
