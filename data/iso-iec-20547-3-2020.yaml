    <p>This document specifies the big data reference architecture (BDRA). The reference architecture includes concepts and architectural views.</p>
    <p>The reference architecture specified in this document defines two architectural viewpoints:</p>
    <p>—     a user view defining roles/sub-roles, their relationships, and types of activities within a big data ecosystem;</p>
    <p>—     a functional view defining the architectural layers and the classes of functional components within those layers that implement the activities of the roles/sub-roles within the user view.</p>
    <p>The BDRA is intended to:</p>
    <p>—     provide a common language for the various stakeholders;</p>
    <p>—     encourage adherence to common standards, specifications, and patterns;</p>
    <p>—     provide consistency of implementation of technology to solve similar problem sets;</p>
    <p>—     facilitate the understanding of the operational intricacies in big data;</p>
    <p>—     illustrate and understand the various big data components, processes, and systems, in the context of an overall big data conceptual model;</p>
    <p>—     provide a technical reference for government departments, agencies and other consumers to understand, discuss, categorize and compare big data solutions; and</p>
    <p>—     facilitate the analysis of candidate standards for interoperability, portability, reusability, and extendibility.</p>
