abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62048:2014(E) is a guideline that gives formulae to estimate the
    reliability of fibre under a constant service stress based on a power law for
    crack growth. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision. The main changes with respect to
    the previous edition are listed below:<br />\r\n- correction to the unit of failure
    rates in Table 1;<br />\r\n- correction to the FIT equation for instantaneous
    failure rate [19] in addition to all call-outs and derivations;<br />\r\n- insertion
    of a new note about fibre length dependency of failure rates;<br />\r\n- addition
    of informative Annex A and relevant reference;<br />\r\n- editorial corrections
    of inconsistencies. Keywords: reliability of fibre, service stress, power law
    for crack growth"
