  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-26:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine the mechanical key control characteristics
    (KCCs)<br />\r\n• Young's modulus (or elastic modulus),<br />\r\n• residual strain,<br
    />\r\n• residual stress, and<br />\r\n• fracture stress<br />\r\nof 2D materials
    and nanoscale films using the<br />\r\n• bulge test.<br />\r\nThe bulge test is
    a reliable method where a pressure differential is applied to a freestanding film,
    and the resulting deformation is measured to derive the mechanical properties.<br
    />\r\n• This method is applicable to a wide range of freestanding 2D materials,
    such as graphene, and nanometre-thick films with thicknesses typically ranging
    from 1 nm to several hundred nanometres.<br />\r\n• This document ensures the
    characterization of mechanical properties essential for assessing the structural
    integrity and performance of materials in applications such as composite additives,
    flexible electronics, and energy harvesting devices."
