abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-46:2013+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    round copper winding wire of class 240 with a sole coating of aromatic polyimide
    resin. The range of nominal conductor diameters covered by this standard is:<br
    />\r\n- grade 1: 0,020 mm up to and including 2,000 mm;<br />\r\n- grade 2: 0,020
    mm up to and including 5,000 mm. The nominal conductor diameters are specified
    in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- deletion of the \"in some countries\" statement
    in the scope;<br />\r\n- new subclause containing general notes on winding wire,
    formerly a part of the scope;<br />\r\n- new subclause containing requirements
    for appearance;<br />\r\n- revision to the notes in Clause 19, Dielectric dissipation
    factor;<br />\r\n- new Clause 23, Pin-hole test. Keywords: requirements of enamelled
    round copper winding wire, class 240, sole coating of aromatic polyimide resin<br
    /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60317-0-1:2013."
