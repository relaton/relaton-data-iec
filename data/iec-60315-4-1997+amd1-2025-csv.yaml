  content: IEC 60315-4:1997+AMD1:2025 CSV Applies to radio receives and tuners for
    the reception of frequency- modulated sound-broadcasting emissions with rated
    maximum system deviations of ±75 kHz and ±50 kHz in ITU Band 8. Deals mainly with
    methods of measurement using radiofrequency signals applied to the antenna terminals
    of the receiver.
