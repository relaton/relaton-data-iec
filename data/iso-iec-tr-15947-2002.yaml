  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 15947:2002 defines a framework for detection of intrusions
    into IT systems. It establishes common definitions for intrusion detection terms
    and concepts. It describes the methodologies, concepts and relationships among
    them, addresses possible orderings of intrusion detection tasks and related activities,
    and attempts to relate these tasks and processes to an organization's or enterprise's
    procedures to demonstrate the practical integration of intrusion detection within
    an organization or enterprise security policy.</p>"
