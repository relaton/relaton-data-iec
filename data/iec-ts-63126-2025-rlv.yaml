  content: "IEC TS 63126:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TS 63126:2025
    defines additional testing requirements for photovoltaic (PV) modules deployed
    under conditions leading to higher module temperature which are beyond the scope
    of IEC 61215-1 and IEC 61730‑1 and the relevant component standards, IEC 62788‑1‑7,
    IEC 62788‑2‑1, IEC 62790 and IEC 62852. The testing conditions specified in IEC
    61215-2 and IEC 61730-2 (and the relevant component standards IEC 62788‑1‑7, IEC
    62788‑2‑1, IEC 62790 and IEC 62852) assumed that these standards are applicable
    for module deployment where the 98th percentile temperature (T98), that is the
    temperature that a module would be expected to exceed for 175,2 h per year, is
    less than 70 °C. This document defines two temperature regimes, temperature Level
    1 and temperature Level 2, which were designed considering deployment in environments
    with mounting configurations such that the T98 is less than or equal to 80 °C
    for temperature Level 1, and less than or equal to 90 °C for temperature Level
    2. This document provides recommended additional testing conditions within the
    IEC 61215 series, IEC 61730 series, IEC 62788‑1‑7, IEC 62788‑2‑1, IEC 62790 and
    IEC 62852 for module operation in temperature Levels 1 and 2. Successfully passing
    a higher Level for a test, sequence of tests, or complete testing for a higher
    Level is an implied passing of the relevant lower‑Level testing. For example,
    passing 200 thermal cycles for Level 2 is considered passing Level 0 and Level
    1 for 200 thermal cycles."
