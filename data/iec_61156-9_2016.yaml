abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-9:2016(E) describes cables primarily intended for the fixed
    part of channels as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and in ISO/IEC TR 11801-9901 which
    is planned to be included in the next edition of ISO/IEC 11801-1. It covers overall
    screened cables with screened (X/FTP) or unscreened (X/UTP) pairs, where X stands
    for F, S or SF, as well as pair-screened cables without overall screen (U/FTP).
    The transmission characteristics of these cables are specified up to a frequency
    of 2 000 MHz and at a temperature of 20 Â°C. Two categories of cables are recognised:<br
    />\r\n- Category 8.1 for use in Class I according to ISO/IEC TR 11801-9901;<br
    />\r\n- Category 8.2 for use in Class II according to ISO/IEC TR 11801-9901."
