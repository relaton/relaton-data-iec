    Is applicable to a.c. series capacitor by-pass switches designed for outdoor installation and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on systems having voltages above 1 000 V.
    It is only applicable to by-pass switches for use in three-phase systems.
    This specification is also applicable to the operating devices of by-pass switches and to their auxiliary equipment.
    This specification does not cover vacuum by-pass switches.
