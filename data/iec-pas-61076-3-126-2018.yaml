  content: "IEC/PAS 61076-3-126:2018(E) covers rectangular IP65/IP67 connectors with
    5 poles for electric power supply up to 16 A. These connectors consist of fixed
    and free connectors, either rewirable or non- rewirable (for both portions). It
    uses the general function principles of the push-pull connector housing system
    described in IEC 61076-3-117 with IP65/IP67 degree of protection according to
    IEC 60529 for harsh applications.<br />\r\nMale connectors have 5 square 1 mm
    electric contacts, with 16 A rated current. Connectors according this document
    are without breaking capacity COC according to IEC 61984, therefore they are not
    intended to be engaged or disengaged in normal use when live or under load, if
    not otherwise specified by the manufacturer."
