  content: "Advanced technologies can be used to promote wellness and prevent illness.
    For example, smart technologies, such as AI and robots, can support eHealth services.
    Smart homes and facilities can support ambient assisted living while new efficiencies
    can be leveraged using technology to decrease healthcare costs and increase their
    availability. This is the vision for digital healthcare in 2030 in which people
    will benefit from longer and healthier lives with the support of technology used
    throughout their lifetime.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGiven the current trends underway,
    it has become increasingly important for the IEC to address healthcare digitalization
    in its future standardization activities. This Societal and technology trend report,
    Digital healthcare, provides a high-level perspective of how the IEC can contribute
    to enabling healthcare in the future. It focuses technologies that are essential
    for achieving digital healthcare in 2030 and identifies current standardization
    work as well as potential gaps where further work will be necessary.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology trend report was developed by the Digital
    Healthcare Sub-Working Group (DH-SWG) of the Societal and Technology Trend Working
    Group (STTWG) in the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available
    for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/digital-healthcare\">free download</a>."
