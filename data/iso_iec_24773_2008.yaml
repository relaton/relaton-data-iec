abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24773:2008 establishes a framework for comparison of schemes for
    certifying software engineering professionals. A certification scheme is a set
    of certification requirements for software engineering professionals. ISO/IEC
    24773:2008 specifies the items that a scheme is required to contain and indicates
    what should be defined for each item.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 24773:2008 will facilitate
    the portability of software engineering professional certifications between different
    countries or organizations. At present, different countries and organizations
    have adopted different approaches on the topic that are implemented by means of
    regulations and bylaws. The intention of ISO/IEC 24773:2008 is to be open to these
    individual approaches by providing a framework for expressing them in a common
    scheme that can lead to understanding."
