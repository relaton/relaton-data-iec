abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013:2015(E) is applicable to three-phase a.c. high-voltage
    generator circuit-breakers, hereafter called generator circuit-breaker, designed
    for indoor or outdoor installation and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and
    60 Hz on systems having voltages above 1 kV and up to 38 kV. It is applicable
    to generator circuit-breakers that are installed between the generator and the
    transformer terminals. Requirements relative to generator circuit-breakers intended
    for use with generators and transformers rated 10 MVA or more are covered specifically.
    Generator circuits rated less than 10 MVA and pumped storage installations are
    considered special applications, and their requirements are not completely covered
    by this standard. This standard is also applicable to the operating mechanisms
    of generator circuit-breakers and to their auxiliary equipment. This standard
    has been prepared by a joint working group comprised of members both from IEC
    17A/WG 52 representing subcommittee 17A: High-voltage switchgear and controlgear,
    of IEC technical committee 17: Switchgear and controlgear, in cooperation with
    IEEE WG P62271-37-013 representing the Switchgear Committee of the Power and Energy
    Society of the IEEE, under the IEC/IEEE Dual Logo Agreement.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of June 2017 have been included in this copy."
