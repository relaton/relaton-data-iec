abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63417:2025 provides guidance and a plan to develop smart energy
    ontologies and other domain-based ontologies within smart energy to achieve semantic
    interoperability through various standards, generic and specific ontologies projects.
    This includes but is not limited to the following.<br />\r\n• Assessment of a
    selection of existing ontologies for the purpose of smart energy applications:<br
    />\r\n– identification of developed ontologies within the energy sectors;<br />\r\n–
    limitations, best practices, and lessons learned;<br />\r\n– use and reuse of
    existing ontologies in the smart energy domain;<br />\r\n– cross-domain semantic
    interoperability support and link to other ontologies.<br />\r\n• Guidance and
    plan for smart energy ontologies development and usage including:<br />\r\n– key
    principles to map or transform existing reference models to the IEC ontology framework;<br
    />\r\n– definition of governance best practices for ontologies applied to process
    the smart energy domain;<br />\r\n– guidance for developing or extending a smart
    energy ontology.<br />\r\nDomain-based ontologies have been developed for semantic
    interoperability in a specific domain but the interaction of semantically equivalent
    objects in different ontologies has not been defined. This document helps users
    and ontology developers to define the complete relationship in different domains
    and different ontologies for the purpose of smart energy applications."
