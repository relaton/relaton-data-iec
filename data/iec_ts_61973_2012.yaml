abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 61973:2012(E) applies to the specification and evaluation of outdoor
    audible noise from high voltage direct current (HVDC) substations. It is intended
    to be primarily for the use of the utilities and consultants who are responsible
    for issuing technical specifications for new HVDC projects with and evaluating
    designs proposed by prospective contractors. It is primarily intended for HVDC
    projects with line-commutated converters. Part of this technical specification
    can also be used for the same purpose for HVDC projects using voltage sourced
    converters, and for flexible a.c. transmission systems (FACTS) devices such as
    static Var compensators (SVCs) and static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs).
