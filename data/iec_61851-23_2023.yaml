abstract:
- content: "IEC 61851-23:2023 applies to the EV supply equipment to provide energy
    transfer between the supply network and electric vehicles (EVs), with a rated
    maximum voltage at side A of up to 1 000 V AC or up to 1 500 V DC and a rated
    maximum voltage at side B up to 1 500 V DC.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the
    EV supply equipment of system A, system B and system C as defined in Annex AA,
    Annex BB and Annex CC. Other systems are under consideration.<br />\r\nThis document
    provides the requirements for bidirectional power transfer (BPT) EV supply equipment
    for system A, with a rated maximum voltage at side A up to 1 000 V AC or 1 500
    V DC. The requirements for reverse power transfer (RPT) and BPT for system B and
    system C are under consideration and are not specified in this document.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the structure has been rearranged according to IEC 61851-1:2017;<br />\r\nb) electrical
    safety requirements in Clause 8 and Clause 12 have been revised based on the requirements
    in IEC 62477-1 and inspired by the hazard based safety approach of IEC 62368-1;<br
    />\r\nc) test methods for checking conformity to the stated requirements have
    been mostly added; general provisions for compliance tests have been specified
    in Clause 102;<br />\r\nd) specific requirements and/or information for the following
    functions have been added: energy transfer with thermal management system (101.2),
    bi-directional power transfer control (Annex DD), multi- side B separated EV supply
    equipment (Annex FF), and communication and energy transfer process (Annex GG);<br
    />\r\ne) Annex AA (system A), Annex BB (system B) and Annex CC (system C) have
    been updated including additions in conjunction with b) and c). This document
    has been limited to be applicable to system A, system B and system C;<br />\r\nf)
    the former Annex DD and Annex EE have been deleted. A new Annex EE, with the requirements
    for the artificial test load, has been added.<br />\r\ng) a new informative annex
    for the touch current and the touch impulse current (Annex HH) has been added"
