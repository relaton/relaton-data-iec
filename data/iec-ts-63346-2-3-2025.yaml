  content: "IEC TS 63346-2-3:2025 specifies common rules and requirements for the
    design of low voltage (LV) AC auxiliary power systems (APSs) intended to be installed
    in substations, mainly covering the configuration of AC power sources, system
    wiring, protection, electric equipment selection and physical layout.<br />\r\nFor
    the purpose of interpreting this document, an AC APS in this document is considered
    as follows:<br />\r\n- with a nominal voltage up to and including 1 kV AC;<br
    />\r\n- providing LV AC power to substation AC loads.<br />\r\nThough it is discussed
    where necessary, AC loads as well as high voltage (HV) part is beyond the scope
    of this document.<br />\r\nSubstations in this document refer to those which are
    part of an electrical system and contain equipment that either receives and distributes
    electrical energy or transforms voltages to the levels required by the loads they
    supply, or both."
