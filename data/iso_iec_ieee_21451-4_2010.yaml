abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-4:2010 defines the protocol and interface that allows
    analog transducers to communicate digital information with an ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451
    object. It also defines the format of the Transducer Electronic Data Sheet (TEDS),
    which is based on the ISO/IEC/IEEE 21451-2 TEDS. It does not specify the transducer
    design, signal conditioning, or the specific use of the TEDS.
