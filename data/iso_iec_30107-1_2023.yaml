abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30107-1:2023 This document establishes terms and definitions that
    are useful in the specification, characterization and evaluation of presentation
    attack detection (PAD) methods.<br />\r\nThis document does not provide the following:<br
    />\r\n- standardization of specific PAD detection methods;<br />\r\n- detailed
    information about countermeasures (i.e. anti-spoofing mechanisms), algorithms
    or sensors;<br />\r\n- overall system-level security or vulnerability assessment.<br
    />\r\nThe attacks to be considered in this document are those that take place
    at the capture device during the presentation and collection of the biometric
    characteristics. Any other attacks are considered outside the scope of this document."
