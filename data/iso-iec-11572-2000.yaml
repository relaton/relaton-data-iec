    <p>This International Standard defines the signalling procedures and protocol for the purpose of circuit-switched Call Control at</p>
    <p>the Q-reference point between Private Integrated Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated</p>
    <p>Services Network (PISN).</p>
    <p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is based upon that described in ITU-T Recommendation Q.931, including the provisions for</p>
    <p>symmetrical operation described in annex D of that recommendation.</p>
    <p>Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International</p>
    <p>Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and</p>
    <p>stage 2 specifications in ECMA-142, ECMA-148 and ISO/IEC 11584.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable to PINXs which interconnect to form a PISN.</p>
    <p>Annex ZC is an integral part of this International Standard.</p>
