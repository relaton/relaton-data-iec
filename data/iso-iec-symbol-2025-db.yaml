  content: Contains graphical symbols used to identify equipment or a part of equipment,
    indicate functional states, designate connections, provide information on packaging
    or provide instruction for the operation of the equipment. A graphical symbol
    is a visually perceptible figure used to transmit information independently of
    language. Each graphical symbol is identified by a reference number and contains
    a title (in English and French), a graphical representation in GIF and vectorized
    PDF format, and some additional data as applicable. Various search and navigation
    facilities allow for easy retrieval of graphical symbols.
