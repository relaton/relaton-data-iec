  content: IEC TR 62971:2015(E) provides guidance and recommendations regarding the
    availability and use of radiation sources that are needed when testing and evaluating
    instruments used for the detection of illicit trafficking of radioactive material.
    Guidance includes the use of surrogate or replacement radioactive materials that
    could be more easily obtained. The object of this Technical Report is to provide
    guidance to instrument manufacturers, users, and testing organisations as to the
    selection and possible use of radiation sources, source surrogates and source
    simulation tools when testing and evaluating an instrument's ability to detect
    and identify illicit trafficking of radioactive material.
