  content: "IEC 63119-1:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 63119-1:2025
    establishes a basis for the other parts of IEC 63119, specifying the terms and
    definitions, general description of the system model, classification, information
    exchange and security mechanisms for roaming between EV charging service providers
    (CSPs), charging station operators (CSOs) and clearing house platforms through
    roaming endpoints. It provides an overview and describes the general requirements
    of the EV roaming service system. The IEC 63119 series is applicable to high-level
    communication involved in information exchange/interaction between different CSPs,
    as well as between a CSP and a CSO with or without a clearing house platform through
    the roaming endpoint. The IEC 63119 series does not specify the information exchange,
    either between the charging station (CS) and the charging station operator (CSO),
    or between the EV and the CS. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2019.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the scope
    is expanded to include differentiation between home and visited service provider
    roles and adds an explicit definition of roaming entity;<br />\r\nb) adds definitions
    for \"home charging service provider (home-CSP)\", \"visited charging station
    operator (visited-CSO)\", and \"charging detail record (CDR)\", and expands related
    terms such as \"service\" and \"roaming entity\";<br />\r\nc) introduces abbreviation
    variants for \"home-CSP\" and \"visited-CSO\" in the terminology, aligning with
    North American and European conventions;<br />\r\nd) updates the communication
    protocol stack by adopting a newer TLS version (upgraded from 1.2 to 1.3);<br
    />\r\ne) system architecture and communication interfaces include detailed interactions
    between home-CSP and visited-CSO;<br />\r\nf) adds a definition for \"service\"
    to cover a broader range of applications such as parking and reservation management;<br
    />\r\ng) adds a distinction between \"charging detail record (CDR)\" and \"service
    detail record (SDR)\" and clarifies their relationship in the terminology;<br
    />\r\nh) enhances the description of user credential transfer methods in communication
    interfaces with greater diversity;<br />\r\ni) enhances the description of the
    mixed mode in the classification of roaming service models, emphasizing improved
    user experience through faster response times."
