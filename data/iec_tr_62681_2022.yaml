abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62681:2022 provides general guidance on the electromagnetic environment
    issues of HVDC overhead transmission lines. It concerns the major parameters adopted
    to describe the electromagnetic properties of an HVDC overhead transmission line,
    including electric fields, ion current, magnetic fields, radio interference, and
    audible noise generated as a consequence of such effects. If the evaluation method
    and/or criteria of electromagnetic properties are not yet regulated, engineers
    in different countries can refer to this document to:<br />\r\n- support/guide
    the electromagnetic design of HVDC overhead transmission lines,<br />\r\n- limit
    the influence on the environment within acceptable ranges, and<br />\r\n- optimize
    engineering costs."
