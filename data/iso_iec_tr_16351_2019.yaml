    16350:2015, including:<br />\r\na) an internal or external application management
    organization that has demonstrated or intends to demonstrate conformity to the
    requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015 and is seeking guidance on the use
    of ASL to establish and improve an AMS and the processes;<br />\r\nb) an application
    management organization that already uses ASL and is seeking guidance on how ASL
    can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 16350:2015;<br />\r\nc) an assessor or auditor who wishes to understand
    the use of ASL as support to achieve the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 16350:2015.<br
    />\r\nThe correlations provided in this document relate to the 2nd version of
    ASL速 (ASL2).<br />\r\nClause 4 describes how ASL速 can support the demonstration
