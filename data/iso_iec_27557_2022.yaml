abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidelines for organizational privacy risk management,
    extended from ISO 31000:2018.</p><p>This document provides guidance to organizations
    for integrating risks related to the processing of personally identifiable information
    (PII) as part of an organizational privacy risk management programme. It distinguishes
    between the impact that processing PII can have on an individual with consequences
    for organizations (e.g. reputational damage). It also provides guidance for incorporating
    the following into the overall organizational risk assessment:</p><p>— organizational
    consequences of adverse privacy impacts on individuals; and</p><p>— organizational
    consequences of privacy events that damage the organization (e.g. by harming its
    reputation) without causing any adverse privacy impacts to individuals.</p><p>This
    document assists in the implementation of a risk-based privacy program which can
    be integrated in the overall risk management of the organization.</p><p>This document
    is applicable to all types and sizes of organizations processing PII or developing
    products and services that can be used to process PII, including public and private
    companies, government entities, and non-profit organizations.</p>"
