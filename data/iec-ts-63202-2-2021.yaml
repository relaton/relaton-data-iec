  content: IEC TS 63202-2:2021 specifies methods to detect and examine defects on
    bare crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar cells by means of electroluminescence (EL)
    imaging with the cell being placed in forward bias. It firstly provides guidelines
    for methods to capture electroluminescence images of non-encapsulated c-Si solar
    cells. In addition, it provides a list of defects which can be detected by EL
    imaging and provides information on the different possible methods to detect and
    differentiate such defects.
