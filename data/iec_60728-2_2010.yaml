abstract:
- content: "IEC 60728-2:2010(E) applies to the radiation characteristics and immunity
    to electromagnetic disturbance of EM active equipment (active and passive equipment)
    for the reception, processing and distribution of television, sound and interactive
    multimedia signals as dealt with in the IEC 60728 series. It specifies requirements
    for maximum allowed radiation, minimum immunity and minimum screening effectiveness
    and describes test methods for conformance testing. It cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2002, of which it constitutes a technical revision
    and includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- updated scope, added some new terms and definitions;<br />\r\n-
    added methods of measurement and performance requirements for telecom signal ports
    of multimedia network equipment;<br />\r\n- updated methods of measurement for
    immunity and emissions;<br />\r\n- applicability of EMC performance requirements
    and methods of measurement to different types of equipment."
