- content: "This document describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language (Clause
    2) that enable operations on source code. These extensions include new syntactic
    forms and modifications to existing language semantics, as well as changes and
    additions to the existing library facilities.<br />\r\nInstructions to modify
    or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly
    to existing text from ISO/IEC 14882:2020 use underlining to represent added text
    and strikethrough to represent deleted text."
