abstract:
- content: "This document:<br />\r\n- specifies a group of structured and inter-related
    concepts pertaining to traceability as a legal or regulatory requirement in the
    Open-edi context, in addition to concepts that appear in other parts of ISO/IEC
    15944 series these concepts having the characteristics of cultural adaptability
    through the use of multilingual terms and definitions;<br />\r\n- provides additional
    specifications for Open-edi scenarios and scenario components from the perspective
    of traceability as required by internal or external constraints in business transactions;<br
    />\r\n- provides a more detailed specification for business transactions regarding
    aspects of traceability, including refined models of Person, Data and Process
    in support of the ability for Open-edi to incorporate elements or characteristics
    of traceability in its information bundles (including their semantic components)
    and business processes;<br />\r\n- realizes specifications and descriptions from
    the traceability requirements as rules and guidelines, to provide recommendations
    or guidance on Open-edi practices; and,<br />\r\n- provides revised primitive
    Open-edi scenario templates for traceability, integrating the modifications to
    the template from other existing parts of ISO/IEC 15944 series.<br />\r\nThis
    document can be used by Open-edi implementers (including business modellers and
    system designers) and Open-edi standard developers in specifying Open-edi scenarios,
    developing Open-edi related standards, and implementing Open-edi rules and guidelines
    for Open-edi activities.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify the FSV aspects
    of traceability, internal behaviour requirements of an organization, or traceability
    as a metrological concept. Detailed exclusions to the scope of this document are
    provided in Annex H."
