abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the requirements for a protocol derived from HCI/HCP
    (see ETSI TS 102 622) enabling communication for devices regardless of data link
    and physical layers. This document covers the following:<br />\r\na) outline of
    a system comprised of one or more hosts and one controller;<br />\r\nb) extension
    of connection topology between hosts and host controller (i.e. star topology and
    additional other topologies);<br />\r\nc) segregation between existing system
    using ETSI TS102 613 and new system compliant to this document (this document
    refers ETSI TS 102 613, but does not change its specification and does not use
    RFU).<br />\r\nFor ETSI TS 102 622, data link layer and physical layer like SWP
    specified in ETSI TS 102 613 is out of the scope.<br />\r\nAlbeit questioned in
    this document, the duplication of OSI transport layer by e.g. enforcing encapsulation
    of HCP into T=1 or the reverse, is out of the scope."
