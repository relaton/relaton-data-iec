abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC/TS 20013:2015 details a reference framework of e-Portfolio implementation
    that can be used to inform and support development of ITLET systems that meet
    the requirements of learners, instructors, e-learning service providers and others
    in contexts such as K-12 education, higher education, training and development.
    The reference framework identifies content and functional components that support
    e-Portfolio systems and interoperability issues that need to be addressed in data
    exchange between these components and interoperability issues that need to be
    addressed in data exchange between the two component types (content and functional)
    and among the various categories. ISO/IEC/TS 20013:2015: provides an e-Portfolio
    reference framework; provides descriptions of e-Portfolios in terms of components,
    categories, and elements; provides descriptions of e-Portfolios in terms of component
    types (content or functional), categories, elements, and items; identifies commonalities
    of current implementations of e-Portfolios; and represents the needs of stakeholders
    (e.g. learners, instructors, etc.). The scope of ISO/IECTS 20013:2015 does not
    include: in-depth technical review of issues related to adaptability to culture,
    language, and human functions; security techniques related to the protection of
    privacy information; authentication of the identity of an IT or ITLET system user;
    how e-Portfolios might integrate with ITLET systems; and specific requirements
    of e-Portfolios or e-Portfolio systems to meet jurisdictional domain requirements.
    ISO/IEC/TS 20013:2015 currently does not address: aspects of accessibility; the
    elements required of learner and instructor; best practices of e-portfolio use
    cases in the fields on K-12 education, higher education and training; guides to
    support the use of e-Portfolios in learning, education, and training environments;
    and detailed technical information regarding specific types of e-portfolios (e.g.
    learning, teaching, assessment, presentation, personal development, career, course,
    program, institutional, or other). It is anticipated that some or all of these
    requirements may be addressed in future editions of ISO/IEC/TS 20013, or in companion
    International Standards or Technical Reports.'
