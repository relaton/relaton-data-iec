abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18013-1:2018 This document establishes guidelines for the design
    format and data content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) in regard to
    both visual human-readable features and ISO machine-readable technologies. It
    creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL
    without impeding individual national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities
    in taking care of their specific needs.<br />\r\nThe design approach of the IDL
    ISO ID-1 size card is to establish a secure domestic driving permit (DDP) for
    both human verification and machine readability and accompanying booklet with
    sleeve insert pocket for international use instead of the international driving
    permit (IDP) paper document (see Annex G).<br />\r\nThe basic document design
    premises include:<br />\r\n— A minimum common mandatory data element set.<br />\r\n—
    A common layout for ease of recognition.<br />\r\n— Minimum security requirements
    for both human and machine verification.<br />\r\n— Interoperability of the machine-readable
    content.<br />\r\nAt the discretion of national/community/regional motor vehicle
    authorities it allows for:<br />\r\n— Inclusion of supplementary optional data
    elements to meet the needs of specific national/community/regional requirements
    apart from the minimum common mandatory data element set.<br />\r\n— Additional
    document physical security elements at the option of national/community/regional
    authorities, and facilitates international procurements.<br />\r\n— Incorporation
    of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC17 machine-readable technologies including integrated circuit
    with contacts and contactless integrated circuit technology, and ISO/IEC JTC1/SC31
    1-dimensional / 2-dimensional bar codes, at the option of national/community/regional
    authorities.<br />\r\n— Incorporation of current and future technologies (including
    biometrics, cryptography, data compression) at the option of national/community/regional
    authorities.<br />\r\nA major benefit of these design premises is that a single
    card may serve a dual purpose of both a national/community/regional licence as
    well as an internationally recognized licence. Therefore, one card, in most cases,
    can replace the need for two documents. Alternatively, those countries that choose
    to maintain their individual domestic design or not to use Latin characters on
    their domestic driving licence for example can issue a second card with or without
    ISO machine-readable technologies. This second card can serve as DDP to be used
    with the accompanying booklet with sleeve insert pocket for international use
    instead of the current IDP paper document.<br />\r\nThis new IDL design yields
    a document that:<br />\r\n— Is more secure from counterfeiting and alteration
    than the previous DDP and IDP documents.<br />\r\n— Allows authorities to verify
    the authenticity of the document.<br />\r\n— Integrates the personal data into
    a secure ID-1 size medium.<br />\r\n— Allows a more reliable identification of
    the licence holder.<br />\r\n— Allows for machine-readable technologies.<br />\r\n—
    Facilitates information exchange and mutual recognition among motor vehicle authorities.<br
    />\r\n— Allows the IDL to serve simultaneously as a DDP and IDP when accompanied
    by the booklet.<br />\r\nIssuing authorities may introduce other functions to
    an IDL provided that it does not interfere with the driving licence function and
    the requirements in this document are not compromised."
