abstract:
- content: "IEC 62899-501-1:2019(E) specifies failure modes and mechanical stress
    test methods for the determination of reliability characteristics of bendable
    or flexible printed primary cells and secondary cells and batteries as defined
    in IEC 60050-482:2004, 482-01-01, IEC 60050‑482:2004, 482-01-02, IEC 60050-482:2004,
    482-01-03, IEC 60050-482:2004, 482‑01-04 and IEC 60050-482:2004, 482-01-05, respectively.<br
    />\r\nImportant parameters and specifications for primary cells are mentioned
    in IEC 60086-1 and IEC 60086-2. IEC 61960-3, as well as IEC 61951-1 and IEC 61951-2
    define performance tests, designations, markings, dimensions and other requirements
    for secondary single cells and batteries. IEC 62133-1 and IEC 62133-2 address
    general safety requirements of secondary cells and batteries."
