abstract:
- content: "IEC 62453-309:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nCommunication Profile
    Family 9 (commonly known as HART® ) defines communication profiles based on IEC
    61158 5 20 and IEC 61158 6 20. The basic profile CP 9/1 is defined in IEC 61784
    1. IEC 62453-309:2022 (EN) provides information for integrating the HART® technology
    into the FDT standard (IEC 62453-2). This part of the IEC 62453 specifies communication
    and other services. This document neither contains the FDT specification nor modifies
    it."
