abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 61174-1:2021 specifies requirements, methods of testing and required
    test results for route plan exchange format (RTZ).<br />\r\nThis PAS has been
    developed to improve interoperability between equipment implementing route plan
    exchange format by addressing issues uncovered in the original RTZ specification
    (Annex S of IEC 61174:2015), and in recognition of the fact that some manufacturers
    have identified a pressing business need to implement an improved and expanded
    version of the RTZ format.<br />\r\nIt is intended to complement the original
    RTZ specification. This PAS provides a revised version 1.2 of the RTZ schema but
    retains the original version 1.0 of the schema unchanged. The intention is that
    compliance with this PAS can be achieved without compromising compliance with
    IEC 61174:2015."
