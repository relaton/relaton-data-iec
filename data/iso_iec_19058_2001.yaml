abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the functional protocol for the
    support of supplementary services and additional basic call</p><p>capabilities
    at the Q-reference point. The Q-reference point exists between Private Integrated
    services Network eXchanges</p><p>(PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated
    Services Network (PISN) and is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. The</p><p>generic functional
    protocol is part of the B-QSIG signalling system.</p><p>The procedures specified
    in this International Standard can be used in association with a bearer connection
    (bearer-related) or</p><p>outside the context of any bearer connection (bearer-independent).The
    application of this International Standard to individual</p><p>additional basic
    call capabilities and supplementary services is outside the scope of this International
    Standard and should be</p><p>defined in those standards or proprietary specifications
    that specify the individual capabilities.</p><p>All conformance to this International
    Standard is based on the external behaviour at the interface at the Q-reference
    point, i.e.</p><p>on the generation of the correct message structure and in the
    proper sequence as specified in this International Standard.</p><p>The generic
    functional protocol is based on ATM Forum specification AF-CS-0102.000, which
    itself is based on the DSS2</p><p>generic functional protocol specified in ITU-T
    Rec. Q.2932.1 but extended to allow non-local information exchange as well as</p><p>local
    information exchange.</p><p>This International Standard is applicable to PINXs
    supporting additional basic call capabilities and/or supplementary services</p><p>requiring
    the functional protocol for signalling at the Q-reference point.</p>"
