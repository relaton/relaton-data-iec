abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the functional protocol for the support of supplementary
    services and additional basic call capabilities at the Q-reference point. The
    Q-reference point exists between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges
    (PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN)
    and is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. The generic functional protocol is part of
    the B-QSIG signalling system.<br />\r\nThe procedures specified in this International
    Standard can be used in association with a bearer connection (bearer-related)
    or outside the context of any bearer connection (bearer-independent).The application
    of this International Standard to individual additional basic call capabilities
    and supplementary services is outside the scope of this International Standard
    and should be defined in those standards or proprietary specifications that specify
    the individual capabilities.<br />\r\nAll conformance to this International Standard
    is based on the external behaviour at the interface at the Q-reference point,
    i.e. on the generation of the correct message structure and in the proper sequence
    as specified in this International Standard.<br />\r\nThe generic functional protocol
    is based on ATM Forum specification AF-CS-0102.000, which itself is based on the
    DSS2 generic functional protocol specified in ITU-T Rec. Q.2932.1 but extended
    to allow non-local information exchange as well as local information exchange.<br
    />\r\nThis International Standard is applicable to PINXs supporting additional
    basic call capabilities and/or supplementary services requiring the functional
    protocol for signalling at the Q-reference point."
