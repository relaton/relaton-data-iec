abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the functional protocol for the support of supplementary services and additional
    basic call</p><p>capabilities at the Q-reference point. The Q-reference point
    exists between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges</p><p>(PINX) connected
    together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN) and is defined in
    ISO/IEC 11579-1. The</p><p>generic functional protocol is part of the B-QSIG signalling
    system.</p><p>The procedures specified in this International Standard can be used
    in association with a bearer connection (bearer-related) or</p><p>outside the
    context of any bearer connection (bearer-independent).The application of this
    International Standard to individual</p><p>additional basic call capabilities
    and supplementary services is outside the scope of this International Standard
    and should be</p><p>defined in those standards or proprietary specifications that
    specify the individual capabilities.</p><p>All conformance to this International
    Standard is based on the external behaviour at the interface at the Q-reference
    point, i.e.</p><p>on the generation of the correct message structure and in the
    proper sequence as specified in this International Standard.</p><p>The generic
    functional protocol is based on ATM Forum specification AF-CS-0102.000, which
    itself is based on the DSS2</p><p>generic functional protocol specified in ITU-T
    Rec. Q.2932.1 but extended to allow non-local information exchange as well as</p><p>local
    information exchange.</p><p>This International Standard is applicable to PINXs
    supporting additional basic call capabilities and/or supplementary services</p><p>requiring
    the functional protocol for signalling at the Q-reference point.</p>
