abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016 specifies services provided in the Microsoft
    Windows platform to enable assistive technologies (AT) to interact with other
    software. One goal of this part of ISO/IEC 13066 is to define a set of application
    programming interfaces (APIs) for allowing software applications to enable accessible
    technologies on the Microsoft Windows platform. Another goal of this part of ISO/IEC
    13066 is to facilitate extensibility and interoperability by enabling implementations
    by multiple vendors on multiple platforms.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016 is applicable
    to the broad range of ergonomics and how ergonomics apply to human interaction
    with software systems.</p>"
