    Specifies an interface system between single or multiple controllers, and control circuit devices or switching elements. The interface system uses two twisted conductor pairs within one cable - one of these pairs provides a communication medium and the other pair provides power to the devices. It also establishes requirements for the interchangeability of components with such interfaces.
    This standard specifies the physical and operating characteristics of the Seriplex controller-device interface.
