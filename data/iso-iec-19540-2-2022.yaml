    <p>This document is a normative supplement to the UAF DMM document (c4i/19-06-16).</p>
    <p>This document specifies a UAF profile to enable practitioners to express architectural model elements and organize them in a set of domains, model kinds, and view specification (specified in the UAF DMM) that support the specific needs of end users in defense and commercial industry.</p>
    <p>UAFP 1.1 defines a set of stereotypes and model elements and relationships to satisfy the requirements of the UPDM 3.0 RFP and the UAF DMM. The profile specification documents the language architecture in terms of UML profiling mechanism.</p>
    <p>A number of UAFP stereotypes inherit from SysML stereotypes where reuse of SysML semantics is necessary. The reusable portions of the SysML specification are not included directly in the specification but are made explicit through the stereotype inheritance.</p>
