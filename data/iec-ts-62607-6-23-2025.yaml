  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-23:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized method to determine the key control characteristic (KCC):<br />\r\n•
    carrier mobility and sheet resistance<br />\r\nfor graphene thin films by:<br
    />\r\n• Hall measurement.<br />\r\nThe carrier mobility is derived by the product
    of the Hall coefficient and the electric conductivity and the sheet resistance
    is derived by the product of the longitudinal resistance and the aspect ratio
    of a Hall device.<br />\r\n• The method is applicable for graphene thin film Hall
    devices with length and width greater than 100 micrometers.<br />\r\nThe document
    is developed to complete the fabrication and measurement of devices using cost-effective
    processes and equipment. Due to the high cost and low cost-performance ratio of
    photolithography processes and equipment, this document does not utilize photolithography
    processes and equipment."
