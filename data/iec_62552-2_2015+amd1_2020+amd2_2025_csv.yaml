abstract:
- content: "IEC 62552-2:2015+AMD1:2020+AMD2:2025 CSV specifies the essential characteristics
    of household refrigerating appliances cooled by internal natural convection or
    forced air circulation, and specifies test methods for checking the characteristics.
    This part of IEC 62552 describes the methods for the determination of performance
    requirements. Although there is some commonality in the set-ups for different
    tests (and so it may be an advantage to apply them all to one sample), these are
    separate tests to evaluate specific characteristics of the sample being tested.
    This part of IEC 62552 does not specify a procedure to generalise the results
    from sample test results to a prediction of the characteristics of the whole population
    from which that sample was selected. IEC 62552-1, IEC 62552-2 and IEC 62552-3
    cancel and replace the first edition of IEC 62552 published in 2007. IEC 62552-1,
    IEC 62552-2 and IEC 62552-3 together constitute a technical revision and include
    the following significant technical changes with respect to IEC 62552:2007:<br
    />\r\n- A cooling capacity test has been added in Part 2 (this part).<br />\r\n-
    A pull-down test has been added in Part 2 (this part).<br />\r\n- Performance
    tests have been added for wine storage appliances in Part 2 (this part)."
