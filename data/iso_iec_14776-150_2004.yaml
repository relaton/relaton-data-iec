abstract:
- content: The SCSI family of standards provides for many different transport protocols.
    The SCSI transfer protocol standards define the rules for exchanging information
    between SCSI devices using interconnects. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776 defines
    the rules for exchanging information between SCSI devices using the Serial Attached
    SCSI (SAS) interconnect, which is compatible with the Serial ATA (SATA) physical
    interconnect. It also specifies three transport protocols, one to transport SCSI
    commands, another to transport Serial ATA commands to multiple SATA devices, and
    a third one to support interface management.
