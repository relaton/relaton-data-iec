    <p>This document specifies a transfer structure, syntax, and coding of messages and data formats when using high-capacity ADC media between trading partners (specifically between suppliers and recipients) and, where applicable, in support of carrier applications, such as bills of lading, and carrier sortation and tracking.</p>
    <p>The data encoded according to this document include:</p>
    <p>—          data which can be used in the shipping, receiving and inventory of transport units;</p>
    <p>—          data which can be contained within supporting documentation, in paper or electronic form, related to unit loads or transport packages;</p>
    <p>—          data which can be used in the sortation and tracking of transport units.</p>
    <p>This document describes the ISO/IEC 646 characters used for automatic data capture; it is not the controlling specification for data structures (e.g. CII) referenced in this International Standard.</p>
    <p>This document does not supersede or replace any applicable safety or other marking or labelling requirements. It is intended to be applied in addition to any other mandated labelling requirements.</p>
