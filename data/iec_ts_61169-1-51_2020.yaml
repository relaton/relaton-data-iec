abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61169-1-51:2020 relates to radio frequency connectors for RF transmission
    lines for use in telecommunications, electronics and similar equipment. It provides
    the technical report for the uncertainty specifications for return loss measurements,
    which apply to individual connector types, by vector network analysers (VNAs).
    It is intended to establish concepts and procedures considering:<br />\r\n– testing
    and measuring procedures concerning frequency domain electrical properties;<br
    />\r\n– uncertainty specifications of VNAs measurements for return loss of RF
    connectors.<br />\r\nThe test methods and procedures of this document are intended
    for acceptance and type approval testing."
