abstract:
- content: "IEC 62930:2017(E) applies to single-core cross-linked insulated power
    cables with cross-linked sheath. These cables are for use at the direct current
    (DC) side of photovoltaic systems, with a rated DC voltage up to and including
    1,5 kV between conductors and between conductor and earth. This document includes
    halogen free low smoke cables and cables that can contain halogens.<br />\r\nThe
    cables are suitable to be used with Class II equipment as defined in IEC 61140.<br
    />\r\nThe cables are designed to operate at a normal continuous maximum conductor
    temperature of 90 °C. The permissible period of use at a maximum conductor temperature
    of 120 °C is limited to 20 000 h."
