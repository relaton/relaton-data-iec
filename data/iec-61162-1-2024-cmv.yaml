  content: "IEC 61162-1:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61162-1:2024 edition 6.0 and the previous IEC 61162-1:2016
    edition 5.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 80 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61162-1:2024 contains the requirements for data communication
    between maritime electronic instruments, navigation and radiocommunication equipment
    when interconnected via an appropriate system. This document is intended to support
    one-way serial data transmission from a single talker to one or more listeners.
    These data are in printable ASCII form and can include information such as position,
    speed, depth, frequency allocation, etc. Typical messages can be from about 11
    to a maximum of 79 characters in length and generally require transmission no
    more rapidly than one message per second. The electrical definitions in this document
    are not intended to accommodate high-bandwidth applications such as radar or video
    imagery, or intensive database or file transfer applications. Since there is no
    provision for guaranteed delivery of messages and only limited error checking
    capability, it is important this document is used with caution in all safety applications.
    For applications where a faster transmission rate is necessary, IEC 61162-2 applies.
    For applications to shore based equipment of the automatic identification system
    (AIS) the IEC 62320 series applies."
