abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015 provides a standard notation called Abstract Syntax
    Notation One (ASN.1) that is used for the definition of data types, values, and
    constraints on data types.</p><p>ISO/IEC 8824-1:2015:</p><p>- defines a number
    of simple types, with their tags, and specifies a notation for referencing these
    types and for specifying values of these types;</p><p>- defines mechanisms for
    constructing new types from more basic types, and specifies a notation for defining
    such types and assigning them tags, and for specifying values of these types;</p><p>-
    defines character sets (by reference to other Recommendations and/or International
    Standards) for use within ASN.1.</p><p>The ASN.1 notation can be applied whenever
    it is necessary to define the abstract syntax of information.</p><p>The ASN.1
    notation is referenced by other standards which define encoding rules for the
    ASN.1 types.</p>"
