abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 12862:2011 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm and an 80 mm dual layer DVD recordable disk to enable the interchange
    of such disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and recorded
    signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format
    of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing for information
    interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD recordable
    disk for dual layer (DVD-R for DL).</p><p>ISO/IEC 12862:2011 specifies the following:</p><ul><li>120
    mm and 80 mm nominal diameter disks that can be either single- or double-sided;</li><li>the
    conditions for conformance;</li><li>the environments in which the disk is to be
    operated and stored;</li><li>the mechanical and physical characteristics of the
    disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;</li><li>the
    format of the pre-recorded information on an unrecorded disk, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding
    method used;</li><li>the format of the data and the recorded information on the
    disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error
    correcting codes and the coding method used;</li><li>the characteristics of the
    signals from pre-recorded and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data processing
    systems to read the pre-recorded information and to write to the disks;</li><li>the
    characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing
    systems to read the data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 12862:2011 provides
    for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard for volume
    and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing
    systems.</p>"
