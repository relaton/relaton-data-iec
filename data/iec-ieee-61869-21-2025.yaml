  content: "IEC/IEEE 61869-21:2025 provides the requirements, the methods and the
    guidelines to be applied on the evaluation of uncertainty in testing the accuracy
    of instrument transformers (IT) with an analogue or a digital secondary signal
    for measuring, protection and control purposes, with rated frequencies from 15
    Hz to 400 Hz.<br />\r\nThis document covers the uncertainty evaluation in testing
    the accuracy of IT (including on-site testing of accuracy) independently of the
    technology used (either inductive or non-inductive).<br />\r\nThis document reports
    on how to take into account the sources of uncertainty in the setups for accuracy
    and how to combine their effects in order to evaluate the uncertainty in the test
    results."
