abstract:
- content: "ISO 15118-4:2018 specifies conformance tests in the form of an Abstract
    Test Suite (ATS) for a System Under Test (SUT) implementing an EVCC or SECC according
    to ISO 15118-2. These conformance tests specify the testing of capabilities and
    behaviors of an SUT as well as checking what is observed against the conformance
    requirements specified in ISO 15118-2 and against what the supplier states the
    SUT implementation's capabilities are.<br />\r\nThe capability tests within the
    ATS check that the observable capabilities of the SUT are in accordance with the
    static conformance requirements defined in ISO 15118-2. The behavior tests of
    the ATS examine an implementation as thoroughly as is practical over the full
    range of dynamic conformance requirements defined in ISO 15118-2 and within the
    capabilities of the SUT (see NOTE).<br />\r\nA test architecture is described
    in correspondence to the ATS. The conformance test cases in this document are
    described leveraging this test architecture and are specified in TTCN-3 Core Language
    for ISO/OSI Network Layer (Layer 3) and above. The conformance test cases for
    the Data Link Layer (Layer 2) and Physical Layer (Layer 1) are described in ISO
    15118-5. Test cases with overlapping scopes are explicitly detailed.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not include specific tests of other standards referenced within
    ISO 15118-2, e.g. IETF RFCs. Furthermore, the conformance tests specified in this
    document do not include the assessment of performance nor robustness or reliability
    of an implementation. They cannot provide judgments on the physical realization
    of abstract service primitives, how a system is implemented, how it provides any
    requested service, nor the environment of the protocol implementation. Furthermore,
    the test cases defined in this document only consider the communication protocol
    defined ISO 15118-2. Power flow between the EVSE and the EV is not considered.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 Practical limitations make it impossible to define an exhaustive
    test suite, and economic considerations can restrict testing even further. Hence,
    the purpose of this document is to increase the probability that different implementations
    are able to interwork. This is achieved by verifying them by means of a protocol
    test suite, thereby increasing the confidence that each implementation conforms
    to the protocol specification. However, the specified protocol test suite cannot
    guarantee conformance to the specification since it detects errors rather than
    their absence. Thus conformance to a test suite alone cannot guarantee interworking.
    What it does do is give confidence that an implementation has the required capabilities
    and that its behavior conforms consistently in representative instances of communication.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 This document has some interdependencies to the conformance tests
    defined in ISO 15118-5 which result from ISO/OSI cross layer dependencies in the
    underlying protocol specification (e.g. for sleep mode)"
