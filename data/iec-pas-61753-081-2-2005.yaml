  content: Contains the minimum initial test and measurement requirements and severities
    which a fibre optic middle-scale 1 x N (16 = N = 64) DWDM (Dense Wavelength Division
    Multiplexing) device shall satisfy in order to be categorized as meeting the IEC
    standard category C-controlled environments. The requirements cover devices with
    single-mode non-connectorized pigtails and no circuit-board. There is also a distinction
    between small-scale (N < 16) and large-scale (N > 64) 1   N DWDM devices for the
    purpose of standards.
