  content: 'IEC/TR 62343-6-11: 2019 which is a Technical Report, proposes a software
    and hardware interface for the optical multicast switch (MCS). This switch can
    be controlled by resident firmware within the interface that is intended to enable
    a user or host to retrieve the switch status and/or adjust relevant switch settings.
    The MCS is defined in IEC 62343-3-4. The technical information regarding MCS and
    its applications in dense wavelength division multiplexing (DWDM) systems is described
    in IEC TR 62343-6-4. The objective of this document is a proposal for a software
    and hardware interface standard of MCS.'
