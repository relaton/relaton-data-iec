abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 21000-20:2016 specifies a language for representing contracts in
    the Multimedia Framework formed for the transaction of MPEG-21 Digital Items or
    services related to the MPEG-21 Framework.<p>Contract Expression Language (CEL)
    aims at digitally representing the agreements made in environments using ISO/IEC
    21000. These agreements are contracts for transactions of content packed as Digital
    Items, as well as services provided around this content.</p><p>The range of contracts
    under scope are as follows:</p><p>- contracts about transactions on rights for
    the exploitation of content as MPEG-21 Digital Items;</p><p>- contracts about
    the provision of MPEG-21-based services, i.e. delivery, identification, encryption,
    search and others.</p><p>The aspects represented by CEL contracts include the
    following:</p><p>- the textual clauses, in natural language as they are in the
    narrative contract, duly structured;</p><p>- the operative clauses, as computer
    language expressions.</p>
