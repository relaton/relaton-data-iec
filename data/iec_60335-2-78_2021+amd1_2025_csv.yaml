abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-78:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of outdoor barbecues
    for household and similar use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V.<br
    />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless can
    be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by
    laymen in shops, restaurants, hotels, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used on board ships, additional requirements may be necessary;<br />\r\n- in
    many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- barbecues for
    indoor use (IEC 60335-2-9);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to burn charcoal or
    similar combustible fuels;<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:
    2008 and Amendment 2:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text is aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 15.101, 22.102);<br
    />\r\nc) requirements for communal use barbecues have been added (Clause 3, 7.1,
    22.103, 22.104);<br />\r\nd) exclusion of battery-operated appliances (Clause
    1);<br />\r\ne) clarification of the need for an RCD is added (7.12).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
