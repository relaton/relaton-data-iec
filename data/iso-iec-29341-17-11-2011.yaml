  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-17-11:2011(E) describes the service-type that enables modelling
    of 'Quality of Service Manager' function capabilities. This service provides a
    mechanism for a Control Point to:<br/>    \n- Be agnostic of the QoS capabilities
    and associated details about the various QoS Devices on the network at the expense
    of potential network inefficiency.<br/>                                         \n-
    Abstract the tasks of setting up, modifying and revoking the QoS associated with
    every traffic stream.<br/>                         \n- QosManager:3 defines new
    capabilities to set up Parameterized QoS. Control Points may now request reservations
    for specific resources for the exclusive use of individual streams. Successful
    resource reservation ensures that streams will always have the bandwidth and other
    resources to transport time critical data.<br/>             \n- QosManager:3 defines
    a method for Control Points to request preemption of existing reservations on
    the UPnP-QoS network if necessary to admit a new stream.<br/>                              \n-
    QosManager:3 supports a mechanism for providing a list of blocking streams to
    a Control Point so that it can handle preemption on its own, if desired. This
    service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0."
