abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63262:2019(E) provides guidelines for applying unified power flow
    controllers (UPFC) in power systems. It includes letter symbols, terms and definitions,
    principles and configurations, design rules, performance requirements for key
    equipment control and protection, insulation co-ordination, system performance
    and tests. This technical report applies to the UPFC based on modular multi-level
    converter (MMC) technology, as well as UPFC based on three-level converter technology.
