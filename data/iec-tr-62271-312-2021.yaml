  content: "IEC TR 62271-312:2021(E) refers to high-voltage / low-voltage prefabricated
    substations (hereinafter prefabricated substations) as specified in IEC 62271-202:2014.<br
    />\r\nThis document, among other options as agreed between manufacturer and user,
    can be used for the transferability of type tests performed on one or more prefabricated
    substations with a defined set of ratings and arrangement of components to another
    prefabricated substation with a different set of ratings or different arrangement
    of components. It supports the selection of appropriate representative test objects
    for that purpose in order to optimize the type testing procedure for a consistent
    conformity assessment.<br />\r\nThis document utilises a combination of sound
    technical and physical principles, manufacturer and user experience and mutually
    agreed upon methods of calculation to establish pragmatic guidance for the transferability
    of type test results, covering various design and rating aspects."
