abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides requirements and recommendations
    for developing education and training systems using virtual, augmented and mixed
    reality (VR/AR/MR) technology. It specifies how to organize the information and
    data necessary for the development of VR/AR/MR integrated systems for education
    and training. It includes procedures for the development of VR/AR/MR integrated
    systems.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document includes several topics for consideration
    when developing VR/AR/MR based education and training systems, as follows. First,
    it defines concepts of VR/AR/MR based education and training. Second, it defines
    an information modelling architecture for the systems. Third, standards based
    functional components for the systems are specified. Fourth, framework components
    for implementing the systems are specified. And, finally, use cases for the systems
    based on the information modelling architecture are included.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Device
    hardware technology for education and training systems is excluded from this document.</p>
