  content: "IEC 60034-9:2021 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60034-9:2021 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60034-9:2003+AMD1:2007
    CSV edition 4.1. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 2 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-9:2021
    specifies test methods for the determination of sound power level of rotating
    electrical machines and specifies maximum A-weighted sound power levels for factory
    acceptance testing of network-supplied, rotating electrical machines in accordance
    with lEC 60034-1, having methods of cooling according to lEC 60034-6 and degrees
    of protection according to lEC 60034-5, and having the following characteristics:<br
    />\r\n- standard design, either AC or DC, without additional special electrical,
    mechanical, or acoustical modifications intended to reduce the sound power level<br
    />\r\n- rated output from 1 kW (or kVA) up to and including 5 500 kW (or kVA)<br
    />\r\n- rated speed not greater than 3 750 min–1<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition, published in 2003 and its amendment
    1, published in 2007. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) In Table 2 and Table
    3 cooling methods IC01, IC11, IC21 and IC31, IC71, IC81 are now covered.<br />\r\nb)
    This edition adds Table 3 for 60 Hz machines, whereas Table 2, which covers only
    50 Hz machines, has no change in levels.<br />\r\nc) In Table 3, grade A is added
    to harmonize the highest levels seen in IEC and NEMA, whereas grade B was added
    to harmonize the lowest, more restrictive levels seen in IEC and NEMA.<br />\r\nd)
    The clause “Determination of noise increments caused by converter supply” has
    been shifted to Annex B and renamed “Information on typical noise increments caused
    by converter supply”."
