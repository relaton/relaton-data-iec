  content: "IEC 60095-1:2018 is applicable to lead-acid batteries with a nominal voltage
    of 12 V, used primarily as a power source for the starting of internal combustion
    engines, lighting, and for auxiliary equipment of internal combustion engine vehicles.
    These batteries are commonly called \"starter batteries\".<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to batteries for the following purposes:<br />\r\n• batteries for
    passenger cars;<br />\r\n• batteries for commercial and industrial vehicles.<br
    />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018 is not applicable to batteries for other purposes, such
    as the starting of railcar internal combustion engines or for motorcycles and
    other power sport vehicles. IEC 60095-1:2018 defines many general properties of
    lead-acid batteries. Single sections can be referenced in other parts of the IEC
    60095 series even if the application is excluded in the scope of this document.
    This document specifies the:<br />\r\n• general requirements;<br />\r\n• essential
    functional characteristics, relevant test methods and results required,<br />\r\nfor
    several classes of starter batteries:<br />\r\n• according to the general type
    of application;<br />\r\n• according to the type of product.<br />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018
    cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in 2006. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) charge acceptance test;<br
    />\r\nb) cranking performance test;<br />\r\nc) charge retention test; and<br
    />\r\nd) endurance test added."
