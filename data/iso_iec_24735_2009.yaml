abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24735:2009 provides a method for measuring digital copying productivity
    of digital copying devices and multifunctional devices with various copying modes.<br
    /><br />\r\nIt is applicable to digital copying devices and multifunctional devices
    equipped with automatic document feeder and collating function.<br /><br />\r\nIt
    is intended to be used for black and white (B&W) as well as colour digital copying
    devices and multifunctional devices of any underlying marking technology.<br /><br
    />\r\nIt allows comparison of the throughput copying rates for a machine operated
    in various available operating modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, 2-up,
    etc) and various available digital image processing configurations.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    24735:2009 includes test files, test setup procedure, test procedure, and the
    reporting requirements for the digital copying productivity measurements."
