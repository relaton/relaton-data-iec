  content: "IEC 60335-2-6:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-6:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-6:2024 deals with the safety
    of stationary electric cooking appliances, such as cooking ranges, hobs, and ovens,
    for household use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    appliances connected between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nThis standard also includes some requirements for ovens that are intended
    to be used on board ships.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within the
    scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n– griddles;<br />\r\n– grills;<br />\r\n–
    induction hobs;<br />\r\n– induction wok elements;<br />\r\n– pyrolytic self-cleaning
    ovens;<br />\r\n– steam ovens.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances intended
    for commercial catering;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– grills, toasters and similar portable
    cooking appliances (IEC 60335-2-9);<br />\r\n– microwave ovens (IEC 60335-2-25).<br
    />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in
    2014 and Amendment 1:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion
    of notes (15.2) and conversion of notes to normative text (Clause 1, 3.1.9.101,
    7.103, 11.7, 15.2, 16.2, 22.109, 22.120, 22.132, 22.124, Figure 103);<br />\r\nc)
    application of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nd) alignment of limits on
    the temperature rise of external accessible surfaces (Clause 11);<br />\r\ne)
    addition of requirements for automatic regulation systems and remote automatic
    regulation systems for induction hobs (3.7.103, 3.11.4, 3.11.5, 3.11.101, 7.12,
    19.102, 22.40, 22.62, Annex AA);<br />\r\nf) addition of requirements for remote
    operation of ovens (22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
