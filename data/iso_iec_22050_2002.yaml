abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    22050:2002 specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of magnetic tape
    cartridges, using magnetic tape 12,65 mm wide so as to provide physical interchange
    of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, the recording method and the recorded format, thereby allowing data interchange
    between drives by means of such cartridges.<br />\r\nThe linearly recorded format,
    called Ultrium-1, has 384 tracks. It uses a timing based servo for improved track
    following. The format supports variable length Logical Records, high speed search,
    and the use of a registered algorithm for data compression.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 22050:2002
    specifies four types of cartridges depending on the length of tape contained in
    the case. These four types are referred to as Type A, Type B, Type C and Type
    D; their nominal uncompressed capacity is 100 Gbytes, 50 Gbytes, 30 Gbytes and
    10 Gbytes, respectively.<br />\r\nTogether with a standard for volume and file
    structure this document provides for full data interchange between data processing
    systems."
