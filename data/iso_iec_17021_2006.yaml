abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 17021:2006 contains principles and requirements for the competence,
    consistency and impartiality of the audit and certification of management systems
    of all types (e.g. quality management systems or environmental management systems)
    and for bodies providing these activities. Certification bodies operating to this
    International Standard need not offer all types of management system certification.   Certification
    of management systems is a third-party conformity assessment activity. Bodies
    performing this activity are therefore third-party conformity assessment bodies.
