  content: "IEC TS 61966-13:2023 defines an objective colour difference metric and
    a measurement method for observer metamerism caused by displays with different
    spectral power distributions. This document also specifies the measuring equipment,
    conditions and methods that are necessary to obtain the metric. This document
    applies to light-emitting or backlit transmitting colour displays measured under
    dark-room conditions.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-03) has
    been included in this copy."
