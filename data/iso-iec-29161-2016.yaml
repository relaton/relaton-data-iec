  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29161:2016 establishes a unique identification scheme for the
    Internet of Things (IoT), based on existing and evolving data structures. This
    International Standard specifies the common rules applicable for unique identification
    that are required to ensure full compatibility across different identities. The
    unique identification is a universal construct for any physical object, virtual
    object, or person. It is used in IoT information systems that need to track or
    otherwise refer to entities. It is intended for use with any IoT media.</p>"
