abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-8:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-8:2022 edition 7.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-8:2012+AMD1:2015+AMD2:2018
    CSV edition 6.2. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-8:2022 deals
    with the safety of electric shavers, hair clippers, epilators, appliances used
    for manicure and pedicure and similar appliances intended for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V, including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use, but which nevertheless possibly pose a
    source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen
    in shops and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. Examples of such
    appliances are animal shearers.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by national health authorities, national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– massage appliances (IEC 60335-2-32);<br />\r\n–
    beauty care appliances incorporating lasers and intense light sources (IEC 60335-2-113);<br
    />\r\n– skin beauty care appliances (IEC 60335-2-115);<br />\r\n– appliances for
    medical purposes (IEC 60601).<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces
    the sixth edition published in 2012, Amendment 1:2015 and Amendment 2:2018. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 3.1.9, 19.10, 20.1, 22.103);<br />\r\nc) clarification of holding
    the appliance with negligible effect on normal operation (3.1.9);<br />\r\nd)
    addition of requirements for detachable power supply parts (6.2, 21.102, 21.103,
    24.2);<br />\r\ne) allowance to waive instructions relating to hot blades on animal
    shearers and commercial animal clippers based on temperatures measured in Clause
    11 (7.12);<br />\r\nf) clarification and consolidation of requirements in 22.26
    and 22.36;<br />\r\ng) clarification of applicability of 30.2.2 and 30.2.3;<br
    />\r\nh) clarification of requirements for interconnection cords for class III
    constructions.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest
    edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in
    that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established
    on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
