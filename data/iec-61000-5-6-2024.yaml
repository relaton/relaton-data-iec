  content: "IEC 61000-5-6:2024 covers guidelines for the mitigation of external electromagnetic
    influences impinging upon a facility or installation, aimed at ensuring electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) among electrical and electronic apparatus or systems. These
    influences include lightning, RF transmitters, power-line and telecom transients,
    high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) and other high-power electromagnetic
    transients such as those from intentional electromagnetic interference (IEMI).
    This document is intended for use by installers, manufacturers and users of sensitive
    electrical or electronic installations or systems. It applies primarily to new
    installations but, where economically feasible, it can be applied to extensions
    or modifications to existing facilities. While the technical principles are applicable
    to individual equipment or apparatus, such application is not included in the
    scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition of IEC TR 61000-5-6 published in 2002. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) updating the whole document to include
    other HPEM environments including IEMI;<br />\r\nb) adding a new Annex A which
    provides details on the concept of EM resilience and includes information on HPEM
    detectors, recovery and restoration."
