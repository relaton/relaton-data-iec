abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the Additional Network Features (ANF) Private User Mobility Incoming Call (PUMI)</p><p>and
    Private User Mobility Outgoing Call (PUMO), which are applicable to various basic
    services supported by Private</p><p>Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic
    services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>ANF-PUMI is an additional network
    feature that directs incoming calls to a PUM user within a PISN regardless of
    the PUM</p><p>user's geographical location within the PISN, provided the PUM user's
    location is known.</p><p>ANF-PUMO is an additional network feature that permits
    the PISN to process call requests from a PUM user at the home</p><p>location,
    if required.</p><p>Additional network feature specifications are produced in three
    stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387.</p><p>This International
    Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO.
    The stage 1</p><p>specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies the general feature
    principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clauses 8 and</p><p>9)
    identifies the Functional Entities involved in the additional network features
    and the information flows between them.</p>
