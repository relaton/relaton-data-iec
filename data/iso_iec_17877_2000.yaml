abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the Additional Network Features (ANF) Private
    User Mobility Incoming Call (PUMI) and Private User Mobility Outgoing Call (PUMO),
    which are applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nANF-PUMI
    is an additional network feature that directs incoming calls to a PUM user within
    a PISN regardless of the PUM user's geographical location within the PISN, provided
    the PUM user's location is known.<br />\r\nANF-PUMO is an additional network feature
    that permits the PISN to process call requests from a PUM user at the home location,
    if required.<br />\r\nAdditional network feature specifications are produced in
    three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387.<br />\r\nThis
    International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-PUMI
    and ANF-PUMO. The stage 1 specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies the general
    feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clauses 8 and
    9) identifies the Functional Entities involved in the additional network features
    and the information flows between them."
