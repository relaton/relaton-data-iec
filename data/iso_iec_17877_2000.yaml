abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Additional Network Features
    (ANF) Private User Mobility Incoming Call (PUMI)</p><p>and Private User Mobility
    Outgoing Call (PUMO), which are applicable to various basic services supported
    by Private</p><p>Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified
    in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>ANF-PUMI is an additional network feature that directs
    incoming calls to a PUM user within a PISN regardless of the PUM</p><p>user's
    geographical location within the PISN, provided the PUM user's location is known.</p><p>ANF-PUMO
    is an additional network feature that permits the PISN to process call requests
    from a PUM user at the home</p><p>location, if required.</p><p>Additional network
    feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387.</p><p>This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage
    2 specifications of ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO. The stage 1</p><p>specification (clauses
    6 and 7) specifies the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage
    2 specification (clauses 8 and</p><p>9) identifies the Functional Entities involved
    in the additional network features and the information flows between them.</p>"
