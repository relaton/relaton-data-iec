    <p>This International Standard defines a Multimedia Content Description Interface, specifying a series of interfaces</p>
    <p>from system to application level to allow disparate systems to interchange information about multimedia content. It</p>
    <p>describes the architecture for systems, a language for extensions and specific applications, description tools in the</p>
    <p>audio and visual domains, as well as tools that are not specific to audio-visual domains.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 15938 specifies system level functionalities for the communication of multimedia content</p>
    <p>descriptions. ISO/IEC 15938-1 provides a specification which will:</p>
    <p> enable development of ISO/IEC 15938 receiving sub-systems, called ISO/IEC 15938 Terminal, or Terminal in</p>
    <p>short, to receive and assemble possibly partitioned and compressed multimedia content descriptions</p>
    <p> provide rules for the preparation of multimedia content descriptions consisting of the tools specified in Parts 3,</p>
    <p>4 and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938 for efficient transport and storage.</p>
    <p>The decoding process within the ISO/IEC 15938 Terminal is normative. The rules mentioned provide guidance for</p>
    <p>the preparation and encoding of multimedia content descriptions without leading to a unique encoded</p>
    <p>representation of such descriptions.</p>
    <p>This part of the MPEG-7 Standard is intended to be implemented in conjunction with other parts of the standard. In</p>
    <p>particular, MPEG-7 Part 1: Systems assumes some knowledge of Part 2: Description Definition Language (DDL) in</p>
    <p>its normative syntactic definitions of Descriptors and Description Schemes, as well as in the processing of schema</p>
    <p>and descriptions. The methods for obtaining the descriptions to which the encoding techniques in this part refer are</p>
    <p>defined in Parts 3, 4, and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938.</p>
    <p>MPEG-7 is an extensible standard. The standard method of extending the standard beyond the Description</p>
    <p>Schemes provided in the standard is to define new ones in the DDL, and to make those DSs as accessible as the</p>
    <p>instantiated descriptions. Further details are available in Part 2.</p>
