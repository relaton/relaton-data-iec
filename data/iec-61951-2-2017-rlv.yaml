    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61951-2:2017
    specifies marking, designation, dimensions, tests and requirements for secondary
    sealed nickel-metal hydride small prismatic, cylindrical and button cells and
    batteries, suitable for use in any orientation, for portable applications.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of battery type;<br />\r\n- addition
    of ‘F’ (high recovery type) designation for cells and batteries;<br />\r\n- addition
    of ‘I’ (low self-discharge type) designation for cells;<br />\r\n- revision of
    Figure 3 (6.1.3.1);<br />\r\n- addition of “optional pip” note to positive contact;<br
    />\r\n- changed leader line position from pip to flats of positive contact (B
