abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63025:2021(E) specifies two test methods for methanol and ethanol
    determination in insulating liquids.<br />\r\nMethanol (MeOH) and ethanol (EtOH)
    are two light alcohols generated during the degradation process of cellulosic
    materials. They are soluble in insulating liquids so they can be regarded as ageing
    tracers whose concentrations in oil reflect the degradation of insulating cellulosic
    materials in liquid-impregnated transformers."
