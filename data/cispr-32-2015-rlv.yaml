  content: "CISPR 32:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCISPR 32:2015
    applies to multimedia equipment (MME) as defined in 3.1.24 and having a rated
    r.m.s. AC or DC supply voltage not exceeding 600 V. This publication covers two
    classes of MME (Class A and Class B). The MME classes are specified in Clause
    4. The objectives of this publication are:<br />\r\n1) to establish requirements
    which provide an adequate level of protection of the radio spectrum, allowing
    radio services to operate as intended in the frequency range 9 kHz to 400 GHz;<br
    />\r\n2) to specify procedures to ensure the reproducibility of measurement and
    the repeatability of results.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
