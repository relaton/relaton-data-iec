  content: "IEC 62341-6-1:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62341-6-1:2025 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 62341-6-1:2022
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 110 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.\r\n<p>IEC
    62341-6-1:2025 specifies the standard measurement conditions and measuring methods
    for determining the optical and electro-optical parameters of organic light emitting
    diode (OLED) displays. Except for the power consumption method, all methods are
    intended for unbounded input signals measured in the flat regions of the display
    in a dark room. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2022. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- The standard average picture level (APL) RGBCMY test pattern
    is modified, and the variable signal loading RGBCMY test pattern is added.<br
    />\r\n- Chromaticity gamut area and colour gamut volume are modified.</p>"
