abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 62958:2015(E) specifies a test method for measuring the reduction
    of microbial contamination in clothes washing machines and of the possible cross
    contamination to uncontaminated load. This PAS applies to clothes washing machines
    for household use, with or without heating devices utilising cold and/or hot water
    supply. It also covers washing machines which specify the use of no detergent
    for normal use. This PAS applies also to washing machines for communal use in
    blocks of flats or in launderettes. This PAS does not deal with professional washing
    machines nor with commercial laundry operations associated with food service,
    hospital linens or other non-residential applications. It also does not address
    the needs of persons with specific health conditions requiring special sanitization
    and/or disinfection techniques. This PAS does not specify safety requirements
    and does not deal with performance of washing machines measured under IEC 60456
    nor with effects on fabrics.
