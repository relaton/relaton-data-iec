abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-16:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62841-2-16:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62841-1:2014.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62841-2-16:2024 is to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 62841-1:2014. This document supplements or modifies the corresponding
    clauses in IEC 62841-1, so as to convert it into the IEC Standard: Particular
    requirements for hand-held fastener driving tools. Where a particular subclause
    of IEC 62841-1 is not mentioned in this document, that subclause applies as far
    as reasonable. Where this document states \"addition\", \"modification\" or \"replacement\",
    the relevant text in IEC 62841-1 is to be adapted accordingly.<br />\r\nIEC 62841-1:2014,
    Clause 1 is applicable, except as follows:<br />\r\nAddition: This document applies
    to hand-held fastener driving tools<br />\r\n- intended for driving fasteners
    into or through concrete, fabric, fiberboard, metal, plastic, wood, wood products,
    cartons, and other materials; and<br />\r\n- whose energy to drive the fastener
    is derived directly or indirectly from an electric motor or magnetic drive.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to pneumatically driven tools where the compressed
    gas comes from an external source, such as a compressor or a tank.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to tools powered by combustible gases, even if electrically
    ignited.<br />\r\nNOTE 101â€ƒTools powered by compressed air or combustible gases
    are covered by ISO 11148-13:2017."
