  content: "IEC TR 60904-14:2020 provides guidelines for measurements of the maximum
    power (Pmax) output of single-junction photovoltaic (PV) modules and for reporting
    at standard test conditions (STC) in industrial production line settings. As it
    is desirable to have consistent measurement practices across the industry, this
    document describes the following features of such measurements:<br />\r\n- Essential
    elements, in order to provide common understanding;<br />\r\n- Common issues or
    complications;<br />\r\n- Sources of error and uncertainty, including recommendations
    to minimize them."
