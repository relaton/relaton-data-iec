  content: "IEC 62841-4-8:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62841-4-8:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62841-1:2014.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62841-4-8:2025 specifies safety requirements
    and their verification for the design and construction of hand fed, shredders/chippers
    with an integral electric motor, with or without vacuum assisted collection, which
    are designed to reduce organic material to smaller pieces and are used in a stationary
    position by an operator standing on the ground. This document applies to shredders/chippers
    with feed intake openings or feed safety openings that in total will fit into
    a square of 250 mm x 250 mm.<br />\r\nNOTE 101 The requirements for the measurement
    of the square of 250 mm x 250 mm are specified in 19.101.1.<br />\r\nIn this document,
    shredders/chippers are referred to collectively as machine(s).<br />\r\nThis document
    does not cover requirements for<br />\r\n- machines powered by combustion engines;
    or<br />\r\n- machines driven by an external power source; or<br />\r\n- machines
    with powered discharge intended to broadcast material or load vehicles; or<br
    />\r\n- machines with mechanically powered feed intake or attachments; or<br />\r\n-
    wood chippers for forestry, agriculture, horticulture and landscaping.<br />\r\nThis
    document is to be used in conjunction with IEC 62841‑1:2014.<br />\r\nThis document
    supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 62841-1, so as to convert
    it into the IEC Standard: Particular requirements for shredders/chippers."
