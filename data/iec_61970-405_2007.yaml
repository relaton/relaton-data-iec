abstract:
- content: Specifies a generalized interface for efficient exchange of messages. Takes
    into account the latencies caused by a Local Area Network (LAN) providing efficient
    data exchange also over Local Area Networks. The Generic Eventing and Subscription
    API is expected to provide one of the primary means for accomplishing application
    integration.<br /><br />This publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid.
