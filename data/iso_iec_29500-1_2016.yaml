abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29500-1:2016 defines a set of XML vocabularies for representing
    word-processing documents, spreadsheets and presentations. On the one hand, the
    goal of ISO/IEC 29500 is to be capable of faithfully representing the pre-existing
    corpus of word-processing documents, spreadsheets and presentations that had been
    produced by the Microsoft Office applications (from Microsoft Office 97 to Microsoft
    Office 2008, inclusive) at the date of the creation of ISO/IEC 29500. It also
    specifies requirements for Office Open XML consumers and producers. On the other
    hand, the goal is to facilitate extensibility and interoperability by enabling
    implementations by multiple vendors and on multiple platforms.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29500-1:2016
    specifies concepts for documents and applications of both strict and transitional
    conformance.</p>"
