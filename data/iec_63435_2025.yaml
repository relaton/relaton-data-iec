abstract:
- content: "IEC 63435:2025 specifies the characteristics of operator support systems
    (OSS) used by the control room staff, maintenance engineers and emergency response
    staff, establishes general principles for OSS lifecycle and requirements for OSS
    design following the human factors engineering (HFE) programme. This document
    also gives the human factors guidelines and the verification and validation (V&V)
    requirements for OSS design.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to new nuclear
    facilities whose conceptual design is initiated after the publication of this
    document but it can also be used for designing OSS in existing nuclear facilities."
