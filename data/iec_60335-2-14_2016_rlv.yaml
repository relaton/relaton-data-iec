abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-14:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-14:2016 deals
    with the safety of electric kitchen machines for household and similar purposes,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V. See the scope of 60335-2-14 for
    a list of appliances that are within the scope of this standard. Appliances intended
    for normal household and similar use and that may also be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. However,
    if the appliance is intended to be used professionally to process food for commercial
    consumption, the appliance is not considered to be for household and similar use
    only. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances which are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction; children playing
    with the appliance. This standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- slicing machines
    having a circular knife the blade of which is inclined at an angle exceeding 45Â°
    to the vertical;<br />\r\n- food waste disposers;<br />\r\n- ice-cream appliances
    with incorporated motor compressors kitchen machines intended for commercial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- kitchen machines intended for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- kitchen
    machines intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such
    as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).
    This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2006 including
    its Amendment 1 (2008) and its Amendment 2 (2012). This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. The principal changes in this edition as compared with the
    fifth edition of IEC 60335-2-14 are as follows (minor changes are not listed):<br
    />\r\n- requirements for noodle makers with a mixing function have been introduced
    (3.1.9.116, 11.7.118, 19.103);<br />\r\n- requirements for appliances having a
    feed screw or auger have been changed (20.106);<br />\r\n- the definition of normal
    operation has been changed (3.1.9);<br />\r\n- the method of carrying out the
    heating test has been changed (11.7);<br />\r\n- the requirement in 20.114 has
    been modified to align with the test specification;<br />\r\n- some notes in Subclauses
    5.2, 11.7.107, 11.7.110, 11.7.116, 20.103, 20.107, 20.108, 20.117, 20.119, 25.14,
    and Annex AA were converted to normative text. It was established on the basis
    of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard. The attention of National Committees
    is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may
    need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of
    its publication.<br />\r\nKey words: Appliances, Kitchen machines<br />\r\nThis
    publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60335-1:2010."
