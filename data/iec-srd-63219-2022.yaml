    procure, implement, and maintain AAL systems throughout their service life.<br
    />\r\nThe objective is to ensure that AAL systems are designed, configured, and
    installed to meet the needs of the AAL user and the requirements from applicable
    industry standards and global regulations. Ultimately, however, users of this
    document are responsible for checking the applicable laws and regulations.<br
    />\r\nThis document is intended for use by persons and organizations acting within
    an AAL service organization such as employees, contractors, and consultants and
    those working with external AAL technology vendors, as appropriate.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides guidance on ensuring that AAL systems meet the needs of the
    AAL service user, in terms of safety, security, privacy, usability, accessibility,
    performance and interoperability.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidance to
    supplement the AAL service organization's established policies and procedures."
