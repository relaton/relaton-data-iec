abstract:
- content: "IEC 62623:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62623:2022
    covers personal computing products. It applies to desktop and notebook computers
    as defined in 4.1 that are marketed as final products and that are hereafter referred
    to as the equipment under test (EUT) or product. This document specifies:<br />\r\n-
    a test procedure to enable the measurement of the power and/or energy consumption
    in each of the EUT's power modes;<br />\r\n- formulas for calculating the typical
    energy consumption (TEC) for a given period (normally annual);<br />\r\n- a majority
    profile to be used with this document which enables conversion of average power
    into energy within the TEC formulas;<br />\r\n- a pre-defined format for the presentation
    of results.<br />\r\nThis document does not set any pass/fail criteria for the
    EUTs. Users of the test results define such criteria. IEC 62623:2022 cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. The first edition of this standard was originally based on ECMA-383.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Additions to terms & definitions and modification
    to short & long idle descriptions.<br />\r\nb) Test setup modifications for notebooks
    where battery pack cannot be removed for testing.<br />\r\nc) Categorisation procedure
    based on ECMA-389 removed.<br />\r\nd) Replace majority profile with new duty
    cycle study including new duty cycle attributes for desktop and notebook in a
    residential and enterprise application.<br />\r\ne) Removal of any reference and
    test methodology to ENERGY STAR V5."
