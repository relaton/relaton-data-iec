abstract:
- content: "IEC 60404-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60404-1:2016(E) is
    intended to classify commercially available magnetic materials. The term \"magnetic
    materials\" denotes substances where the application requires the existence of
    ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic properties. The classification of magnetic materials
    is based upon the generally recognized existence of two main groups of products:<br
    />\r\n- soft magnetic materials (coercivity less than or equal to 1 000 A/m);<br
    />\r\n- hard magnetic materials (coercivity greater than 1 000 A/m). This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Removal of all tables and values describing typical properties
    of the material to be consistent with the aim of the document to be a classification
    and not a specification.<br />\r\nb) Enlargement of the Ni content for the classes
    E1 and E3.<br />\r\nc) Enlargement of the Co content for the classes F3.<br />\r\nd)
    Addition of a new class: U5 bonded rare earth-iron-nitrogen magnets."
