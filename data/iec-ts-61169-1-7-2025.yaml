  content: "IEC TS 61169-1-7:2025 relates to radio frequency connectors for RF transmission
    lines for use in telecommunications, electronics and similar equipment.<br />\r\nThis
    document sets out the provisions for a report on the uncertainty specifications
    for insertion loss measurements, which apply to individual connector types, by
    vector network analyzers (VNAs). It is intended to establish concepts and procedures
    considering<br />\r\n– testing and measuring procedures concerning frequency domain
    electrical properties, and<br />\r\n– uncertainty specifications of VNAs measurements
    for insertion loss of RF connectors.<br />\r\nThe test methods and procedures
    of this document are intended for acceptance and type approval testing."
