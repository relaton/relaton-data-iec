abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61189-5-506:2019(E) is an intercomparison supporting the development
    of IEC 61189-5-501 in relation to the SIR method. This document sets out to validate
    the introduction of a new 200-µm gap SIR pattern, and was benched marked against
    existing SIR gap patterns of 318 µm and 500 µm.
