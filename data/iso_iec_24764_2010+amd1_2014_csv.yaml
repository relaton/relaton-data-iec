    cabling and optical fibre cabling. It is based upon and references the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 11801 and contains additional requirements that are appropriate to
    data centres in which the maximum distance over which communications services
    have to be distributed is 2 000 m.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read
    in conjunction with ISO/IEC 11801:2002, its amendment 1:2008and its amendment
