  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-11:2017 specifies security-related interindustry commands
    to be used for personal verification through biometric methods in integrated circuit
    cards. It also defines the data structure and data access methods for use of the
    card as a carrier of the biometric reference and/or as the device to perform the
    verification of the cardholder's biometric probe (on-card biometric comparison).
    Identification of persons using biometric methods is outside the scope of this
    document.</p>"
