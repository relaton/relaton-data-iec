abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009 defines the concepts of conformance testing for
    biometric data interchange formats and defines a general conformance testing framework.
    It specifies common (modality-neutral) elements of the testing methodology, such
    as test methods and procedures, implementation conformance claim, and test results
    reporting. It also provides the assertion language definition and sets forth other
    testing and reporting requirements, and outlines other aspects of the conformance
    testing methodology that are generally applicable and not modality-specific. As
    part of the conformance testing methodology, different types and levels of conformance
    testing are described, as well as their applicability. The conformance testing
    methodology specified in ISO/IEC 29109-1:2009 is concerned only with data interchange
    format records and systems that produce or use these records.</p>"
