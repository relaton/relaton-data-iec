abstract:
- content: "IEC 61215-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61215-1:2021 lays down requirements
    for the design qualification of terrestrial photovoltaic modules suitable for
    long-term operation in open-air climates. The useful service life of modules so
    qualified will depend on their design, their environment and the conditions under
    which they are operated. Test results are not construed as a quantitative prediction
    of module lifetime. This document is intended to apply to all terrestrial flat
    plate module materials such as crystalline silicon module types as well as thin-film
    modules. It does not apply to systems that are not long-term applications, such
    as flexible modules installed in awnings or tenting. This second edition of IEC
    61215-1 cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61215-1, published in 2016.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. Addition of a test taken from IEC TS 62782.<br
    />\r\nb. Addition of a test taken from IEC TS 62804-1.<br />\r\nc. Addition of
    test methods required for flexible modules. This includes the addition of the
    bending test (MQT 22).<br />\r\nd. Addition of definitions, references and instructions
    on how to perform the IEC 61215 design qualification and type approval on bifacial
    PV modules.<br />\r\ne. Clarification of the requirements related to power output
    measurements.<br />\r\nf. Addition of weights to junction box during 200 thermal
    cycles.<br />\r\ng. Requirement that retesting be performed according to IEC TS
    62915.<br />\r\nh. Removal of the nominal module operating test (NMOT), and associated
    test of performance at NMOT, from the IEC 61215 series.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of May 2021 have been included in this copy.</p>"
