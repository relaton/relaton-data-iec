abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23002-4:2014 defines the description of the MPEG video tool
    library (VTL) based on the decoder description specified in ISO/IEC 23001-4. This
    tool library defines the specification of FUs, which are sufficient to build complete
    decoding solutions according to the following coding standards:</p><ul><li>ISO/IEC
    14496-2 (MPEG-4 Simple Profile), and</li><li>ISO/IEC 14496-10 (MPEG-4 AVC Constrained
    Baseline Profile).</li></ul><p>The objective of ISO/IEC 23001-4 is to define the
    general framework principles, and ISO/IEC 23002-4:2014 defines the MPEG VTL that
    includes relevant tools (or FUs) from the existing MPEG coding standards. Each
    FU is defined in the form of a textual description. The conventions followed by
    the input and output behavior are also described.</p><p>Implementations compliant
    with ISO/IEC 23002-4:2014 can be designed using any software or hardware language
    and components. The reference software for the textual specification of FUs is
    written in RVC-CAL language of which a formal syntax is provided in ISO/IEC 23001-4,
    and which will be defined in Amendment 1 to ISO/IEC 23002-4.</p>"
