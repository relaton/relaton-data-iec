  content: "IEC 62271-111:2012(E) applies to all overhead, pad mounted, dry vault
    and submersible single or multi-pole alternating current automatic circuit reclosers
    and fault interrupters for rated maximum voltages above 1 000 V and up to 38 kV.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2005,
    and constitutes a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous
    edition are as follows:<br />\r\na) addition of exclusion of devices with dependent
    manual operation to 1.1;<br />\r\nb) harmonization of the amplitude factor kaf
    used for calculating the TRV for cable connected systems consistent with recent
    harmonization of the circuit-breaker standards between IEEE and IEC;<br />\r\nc)
    deletion of requirements for radio influence voltage (RIV) tests;<br />\r\nd)
    addition of specifications and ratings to cover the cutout recloser and its special
    requirements.<br />\r\nThis standard has been jointly revised by Switchgear Committee
    of the IEEE Power and Energy Society, in cooperation with subcommittee 17A: High-voltage
    switchgear and controlgear with reference to IEEE Std C37.60-2012(E).<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/6685\">IEC
