abstract:
- content: "IEC 63241-2-19:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 63241-2-19:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 63241-1:2023.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 63241-2-19:2025 applies to jointers. This
    document is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC 63241-1:2023.
    The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers
    and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication
    of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance
    with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised
    tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date
    of publication."
