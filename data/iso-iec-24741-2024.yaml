    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document describes the history and purpose of biometrics, the various biometric technologies in general use today (for example, fingerprint recognition, face recognition and iris recognition) and the architecture of the systems and the system processes that allow automated recognition using those technologies. It provides information on the application of biometrics in various business domains, such as border management, law enforcement and driver licencing. It also provides information on the societal and jurisdictional considerations that are typically taken into account in biometric systems.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">Additionally, this document provides guidance on the use of the International Standards that underpin the use of biometric recognition systems.</span></p>
