abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24756:2009 defines a framework for specifying a common access profile
    (CAP) of needs and capabilities of users, computing systems, and their environments,
    including access supported by assistive technologies. It provides a basis for
    identifying and dealing with accessibility issues in a standardized manner across
    multiple platforms. It can be used to evaluate the accessibility of existing systems
    in particular environments for particular users.Users of various systems in various
    environments can experience temporary or permanent accessibility difficulties.
    Potential users of systems need to evaluate whether the systems will be accessible
    to them in the intended environments in which they will be used. Where accessibility
    can be insufficient, either due to environmental barriers or poor design, these
    users can wish to resort to assistive technologies (ATs) to provide the required
    level of accessibility. Currently, there is no common framework for describing
    accessibility needs or abilities. This requires each potential user to develop
    their own evaluation method, and then to investigate and evaluate various systems
    and ATs using this method. However, due to the lack of an existing method, there
    might also be a lack of suitable information on the abilities of different systems
    and ATs, leading to inefficiency, confusion, frustration and a general lack of
    satisfaction by the user.ISO/IEC 24756:2009 introduces a model of accessibility
    as a basis for understanding access issues with the interactions between users
    and systems in various environments. It further describes logical operators used
    along CAPs to qualify and combine them. It then specifies methods to apply a CAP.
