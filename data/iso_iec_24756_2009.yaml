abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24756:2009 defines a framework for specifying a common access
    profile (CAP) of needs and capabilities of users, computing systems, and their
    environments, including access supported by assistive technologies. It provides
    a basis for identifying and dealing with accessibility issues in a standardized
    manner across multiple platforms. It can be used to evaluate the accessibility
    of existing systems in particular environments for particular users.</p><p>Users
    of various systems in various environments can experience temporary or permanent
    accessibility difficulties. Potential users of systems need to evaluate whether
    the systems will be accessible to them in the intended environments in which they
    will be used. Where accessibility can be insufficient, either due to environmental
    barriers or poor design, these users can wish to resort to assistive technologies
    (ATs) to provide the required level of accessibility. Currently, there is no common
    framework for describing accessibility needs or abilities. This requires each
    potential user to develop their own evaluation method, and then to investigate
    and evaluate various systems and ATs using this method. However, due to the lack
    of an existing method, there might also be a lack of suitable information on the
    abilities of different systems and ATs, leading to inefficiency, confusion, frustration
    and a general lack of satisfaction by the user.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24756:2009 introduces
    a model of accessibility as a basis for understanding access issues with the interactions
    between users and systems in various environments. It further describes logical
    operators used along CAPs to qualify and combine them. It then specifies methods
    to apply a CAP.</p>"
