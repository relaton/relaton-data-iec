abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance on the development, implementation and
    maintenance of a risk management system for medical devices according to ISO 14971:2019.<br
    />\r\nThe risk management process can be part of a quality management system,
    for example one that is based on ISO 13485:2016[24], but this is not required
    by ISO 14971:2019. Some requirements in ISO 13485:2016 (Clause 7 on product realization
    and 8.2.1 on feedback during monitoring and measurement) are related to risk management
    and can be fulfilled by applying ISO 14971:2019. See also the ISO Handbook: ISO
    13485:2016 - Medical devices - A practical guide."
