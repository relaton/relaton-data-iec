  content: "IEC 60335-2-104:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-104:2021
    deals with the safety of electrical recovery and/or recycle equipment to recover
    and/or recycle refrigerant from air conditioning and refrigeration equipment.
    This applies to air-conditioning, heat-pumps and refrigeration equipment incorporating
    open drive or motor-compressors, their maximum rated voltages being not more than
    300 V for single phase appliances and 600 V for all other equipment.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by service personnel
    in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nThe appliances referenced above may consist of one or more factory made
    assemblies. If provided in more than one assembly, the separate assemblies are
    to be used together, and the requirements are based on the use of matched assemblies.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2003. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Clause 1 - The scope has been edited to reflect that \"appliance\" in
    this document means recovery and/or recycle equipment to recover and/or recycle
    refrigerant from air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment.<br />\r\nb) Clause
    2 - Normative references were added.<br />\r\nc) Clause 3 - Some definitions were
    deleted, some were added.<br />\r\nd) Subclause 7.1 - Some markings were deleted,
    some were added.<br />\r\ne) Subclause 7.6 - Symbols were added for “read operator’s
    manual”, “operator’s manual; operating instructions” including coloring are placed
    in visible location; maximum allowable pressure markings following X MPa.<br />\r\nf)
    Subclause 19.11.4 was modified.<br />\r\ng) Subclause 21.1 was modified.<br />\r\nh)
    Subclause 21.2 was modified.<br />\r\ni) Subclause 22.102 was modified.<br />\r\nj)
    Subclause 22.104.1.1 was modified.<br />\r\nk) Subclause 22.104.5 was modified.<br
    />\r\nl) Subclause 22.104.10 was modified.<br />\r\nm) Subclause 22.104.11 was
    modified.<br />\r\nn) Subclause 22.105.1 was modified.<br />\r\no) Subclause 22.107
    was modified.<br />\r\np) Subclause 30.2 was moved to Clause 29.<br />\r\nq) Annex
    AA was deleted and replaced with Annex AA.<br />\r\nr) Annex BB was deleted and
    replaced with former IEC 60335-2-104 Annex CC (normative) Compatibility requirements
    following addition to Annex BB.<br />\r\ns) Annex DD was deleted and replaced
    with Annex CC.<br />\r\nt) New Annex DD was added.<br />\r\nu) New Annex EE was
    added.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the fifth edition
