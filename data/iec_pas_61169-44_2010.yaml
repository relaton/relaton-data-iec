abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 61169-44:2010(E) provides information and rules for preparation
    of detail specification of SMP series blind mating RF connectors together with
    the pro forma blank detail specification. It also prescribes mating face dimensions
    for general connectors - grade 1, dimensional details of standard test connectors
    - grade 0, gauging information and tests selected from IEC 61169-1, applicable
    to all detail specifications relating to RBMA series blind mating RF connectors.
    It indicates recommended performance characteristics to be considered when writing
    a detail specification and it covers test schedules and inspection requirements
    for assessment levels M and H. SMP series push-on connectors with characteristic
    impedance 50 ohm are used with RF cables or micro-strips in microwave, telecommunication,
    wireless and other fields. The operating frequency limit is up to 40 GHz.
