  content: The SCSI command set is designed to provide efficient peer-to-peer operation
    of input&#x2F;output devices (disks, tapes, printers, etc.) by an operating system.
    The SCSI command set assumes a command-response protocol. Action on SCSI commands
    shall not be deemed completed until a response is received. The response shall
    include a status that indicates the final disposition of the command. The SCSI
    command set provides multiple operating systems concurrent control over one or
    more input&#x2F; output devices. The SCSI-3 Optical Memory Card (OMC) command
    set specifies the commands for a device that declares itself as an optical memory
    card device in the device type field of the INQUIRY command. The OMC command set
    is specified independently of any service delivery subsystem; an underlying command-response
    protocol is assumed. This standard defines the device model for the optical memory
    card devices.
