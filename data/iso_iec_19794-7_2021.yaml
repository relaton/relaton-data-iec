abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies data interchange formats for signature/sign
    behavioural data captured in the form of a multi-dimensional time series using
    devices such as digitizing tablets or advanced pen systems. The data interchange
    formats are generic, in that they can be applied and used in a wide range of application
    areas where handwritten signs or signatures are involved. No application-specific
    requirements or features are addressed in this document.</p><p>This document contains:</p><p>—
    a description of what data can be captured;</p><p>— three binary data formats
    for containing the data: a full format for general use, a compression format capable
    of holding the same amount of information as the full format but in compressed
    form, and a compact format for use with smart cards and other tokens that does
    not require compression/ decompression but conveys less information than the full
    format;</p><p>— an XML schema definition; and</p><p>— examples of data record
    contents and best practices in capture.</p><p>Specifying which of the format types
    and which options defined in this document are to be applied in a particular application
    is out of scope; this needs to be defined in application-specific requirements
    specifications or application profiles.</p><p>It is advisable that cryptographic
    techniques be used to protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality
    of stored and transmitted biometric data; yet such provisions are beyond the scope
    of this document.</p><p>This document also specifies elements of conformance testing
    methodology, test assertions and test procedures as applicable to this document.
    It establishes test assertions on the structure and internal consistency of the
    signature/sign time series data formats defined in this document (type A level
    1 and 2 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1) and semantic test assertions (type A level
    3 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1).</p><p>The conformance testing methodology specified
    in this document does not establish:</p><p>— tests of other characteristics of
    biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance,
    performance, robustness, security); or</p><p>— tests of conformance of systems
    that do not produce data records claimed to conform to the requirements of this
    document.</p>"
