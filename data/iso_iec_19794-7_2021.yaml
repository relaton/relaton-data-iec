abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19794-7:2021 This document specifies data interchange formats
    for signature/sign behavioural data captured in the form of a multi-dimensional
    time series using devices such as digitizing tablets or advanced pen systems.
    The data interchange formats are generic, in that they can be applied and used
    in a wide range of application areas where handwritten signs or signatures are
    involved. No application-specific requirements or features are addressed in this
    document.<br />\r\nThis document contains:<br />\r\n- a description of what data
    can be captured;<br />\r\n- three binary data formats for containing the data:
    a full format for general use, a compression format capable of holding the same
    amount of information as the full format but in compressed form, and a compact
    format for use with smart cards and other tokens that does not require compression/
    decompression but conveys less information than the full format;<br />\r\n- an
    XML schema definition; and<br />\r\n- examples of data record contents and best
    practices in capture.<br />\r\nSpecifying which of the format types and which
    options defined in this document are to be applied in a particular application
    is out of scope; this needs to be defined in application-specific requirements
    specifications or application profiles.<br />\r\nIt is advisable that cryptographic
    techniques be used to protect the authenticity, integrity, and confidentiality
    of stored and transmitted biometric data; yet such provisions are beyond the scope
    of this document.<br />\r\nThis document also specifies elements of conformance
    testing methodology, test assertions and test procedures as applicable to this
    document. It establishes test assertions on the structure and internal consistency
    of the signature/sign time series data formats defined in this document (type
    A level 1 and 2 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1) and semantic test assertions (type
    A level 3 as defined in ISO/IEC 19794-1).<br />\r\nThe conformance testing methodology
    specified in this document does not establish:<br />\r\n- tests of other characteristics
    of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance,
    performance, robustness, security); or<br />\r\n- tests of conformance of systems
    that do not produce data records claimed to conform to the requirements of this
    document."
