  content: "IEC 60034-18-1:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60034-18-1:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60034-18-1:2010
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 2 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60034-18-1:2022 deals with the general guidelines for functional
    evaluation of electrical insulation systems, used or proposed to be used in rotating
    electrical machines within the scope of IEC 60034-1, in order to qualify them.
    IEC 60034-18-1 defines general requirements on the qualification of insulation
    systems, where – for thermal ageing – the Arrhenius equations do not necessarily
    fit, according to many experiences.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na.
    provides general guidelines for functional evaluation of different types of windings
    as before but incorporates those changes, which have been introduced for the electrical
    qualification and evaluation of windings which are electrically stressed by converter-supply;\r\n<div
    style=\"text-align:justify\">b. is now focused on general guidelines with all
    technical details of procedures and qualification principles moved to the subsequent
    parts;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">c. details additional general
    aspects of functional evaluation and qualification, particularly the procedure
    for comparison between reference and candidate insulation systems, the introduction
    of the concept of qualification for different expected life-times in service and
    the evaluation of minor component or manufacturing changes.</div>"
