  content: "IEC 62548-1:2023 sets out design requirements for photovoltaic (PV) arrays
    including DC array wiring, electrical protection devices, switching and earthing
    provisions. The scope includes all parts of the PV array and final power conversion
    equipment (PCE), but not including energy storage devices, loads or AC or DC distribution
    network supplying loads. The object of this document is to address the design
    safety requirements arising from the particular characteristics of photovoltaic
    systems. This document also includes extra protection requirements of PV arrays
    when they are directly connected with batteries at the DC level.<br />\r\nThis
    first edition cancels and replaces IEC 62548 published in 2016. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Revised provisions for systems including DC to DC conditioning units.<br
    />\r\nb) Revision of mounting structure requirements.<br />\r\nc) Revised cable
    requirements.<br />\r\nd) Revision of Clause 6 on safety issues which includes
    provisions for protection against electric shock including array insulation monitoring
    and earth fault detection.<br />\r\ne) Revision of 7.2.7 and 7.3 with respect
    to isolation means.<br />\r\nf) Provisions for use of bifacial modules and modules
    mounted in non-optimal orientations.<br />\r\ng) New Annex F containing: KI factor
    calculations for bifacial and non-optimally oriented systems; anti-PID equipment
    and arc flash."
