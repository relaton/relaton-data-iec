  content: IEC TR 62396-7:2017 is a technical report which describes a process to
    account for the effects of atmospheric radiation on electronic equipment. Single
    event effects (SEE) due to atmospheric radiation are one class of possible failure
    mechanisms that are addressed in the safety and reliability analyses of electronic
    equipment and associated functions. This document focuses on electronic components,
    electronic equipment and associated electronic functions. System level analysis
    is not addressed in this document. This document is intended to describe an approach
    to accounting for SEE in electronic equipment design, design review, and it can
    provide aid in the aerospace certification process.
