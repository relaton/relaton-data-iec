abstract:
- content: Icons are used on Information and Communications Technology (ICT) products
    to facilitate interaction with their users. Icons can provide a language-independent
    means of communicating information to the user.ISO/IEC 11581 recognizes that icons
    are more than just symbols used on computer screens. Icons are interaction objects
    used by computer interfaces to accomplish various purposes. Icons can be rendered
    in various forms, including using graphics, gesture, audio, tactile/haptics, or
    any combination thereof. This versatility in rendition can provide greater accessibility
    to their underlying functionalities. ISO/IEC 11581 provides a framework as a basis
    for organizing information related to the creation and use of user interface icons.ISO/IEC
    11581-40:2011 defines supplementary procedural information, requirements and criteria
    that apply to a collection of icon standards published as a web-accessible icon
    database. It is based on the second paragraph of Annex ST, Procedures for the
    development and maintenance of standards in database format of the ISO/IEC Directives
    - Supplement - Procedures specific to ISO.
