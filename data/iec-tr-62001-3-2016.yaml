  content: "IEC TR 62001-3:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, provides guidance
    on the harmonic interaction across converters, pre-existing harmonics, AC network
    impedance modelling and simulation of AC filter performance. The scope of this
    document covers AC side filtering for the frequency range of interest in terms
    of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances. It excludes filters
    designed to be effective in the PLC and radio interference spectra. This document
    concerns the &quot;conventional&quot; AC filter technology and line-commutated
    high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converters. This first edition of IEC TR 62001-3,
    together with IEC TR 62001-1, IEC TR 62001-2 and IEC TR 62001-4, cancels and replaces
    IEC TR 62001 published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to IEC TR 62001:</br>\r\na) expanded and supplemented Clause 6;</br>\r\nb) new
    Clause 4;</br>\r\nc) new Clause 5;</br>\r\nd) new annexes on the location of worst
    case network impedance;</br>\r\ne) accuracy of network component modelling at
    harmonic frequencies;</br>\r\nf) further guidance for the measurement of harmonic
    voltage distortion;</br>\r\ng) project experience of pre-existing harmonic issues;</br>\r\nh)
    worked examples showing impact of pre-existing distortion;</br>\r\ni) comparison
    of calculation methods."
