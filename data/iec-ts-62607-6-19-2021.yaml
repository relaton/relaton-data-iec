  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-19:2021(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic<br />\r\n• elemental composition<br />\r\nfor
    powder consisting of graphene-based material by<br />\r\n• CS analyser and ONH
    analyser.<br />\r\nThe method as described in this document determines the content
    of carbon (C), sulfur (S), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H).<br />\r\nThe
    carbon (C) and sulfur (S) content in graphene powder is derived by the content
    of converted CO, CO2 and SO2, which is determined by infrared gas detector (IGD)
    using a non-dispersive infrared adsorption method in CS analyser.<br />\r\nThe
    content of oxygen (O), nitrogen (N) and hydrogen (H) in graphene powder is derived
    by ONH analyser using pyrolysis method. The O content is obtained according to
    the content of converted CO and CO2, which is determined by IGD using a non-dispersive
    infrared adsorption method. The N content is obtained according to the content
    of converted N2, which is determined by a thermal conductivity detector (TCD)
    method. The H content is obtained by measuring converted H2 or H2O, corresponding
    to TCD or IGD method.<br />\r\n• The method is applicable for graphene, graphene
    oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) in powder form."
