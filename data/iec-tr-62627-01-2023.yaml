  content: "IEC TR 62627-01:2023 which is a Technical Report, details cleaning methods
    for fibre optic connectors. It includes typical cleaning tools and machines, and
    cleaning procedures. Other cleaning methods exist. The impact of contamination
    and the reasons for connector visual inspection and cleaning are described in
    Annex B. This document does not address the visual inspection procedures, which
    are covered in IEC 61300-3-35. Optical fibre patch cords are handled by the operators
    and maintenance staff of optical network systems. This document is useful as a
    guideline to prepare instruction manuals for those involved in optical system
    maintenance and operation. This document covers fibre optic connector plugs, optical
    adaptors, optical receptacles (excluding optical transceivers) and dust caps.
    Guidelines for fibre optic connector end-face cleaning methods for receptacle
    style optical transceivers are covered in IEC TR 62572-4. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of cleaning
    tools for adhesive pad type and adhesive pen type in terms and definitions (Clause
    3), in information (7.5 and 7.6), in fibre optic connectors and their applicable
    cleaning tools (Table 1 and Clause 8) and procedures (9.5, 9.6 and 9.7);<br />\r\n-
    addition of classification of cleaning tools and machines (Figure 1)."
