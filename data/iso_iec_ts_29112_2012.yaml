abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29112 defines methods for the objective measurement of the print
    quality characteristics that contribute to the perceived resolution of reflection
    mode monochrome printed pages produced by digital electro-photographic printers.<br
    /><br /><br />\r\nThe measurement methods used in ISO/IEC 29112 are derived from
    several existing techniques for the assessment of an imaging system's resolution
    characteristics. Each of these measurement methods is intended for the engineering
    evaluation of a printing system's perceived resolution and not for purposes of
    advertising claims.<br /><br /><br />\r\nThe methods are applicable only to monochrome
    prints produced in reflection mode by electro-photographic printing technology.<br
    /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 29112 is intended for monochrome printers utilizing
    postscript interpreters capable of accepting postscript and encapsulated postscript
    (EPS) jobs."
