  content: "IEC TR 62461:2015(E) gives guidelines for the application of the uncertainty
    analysis according to ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 and its Supplement 1:2008 for measurements
    covered by standards in the field of radiation protection instrumentation. It
    does not include the uncertainty associated with the concept of the measuring
    quantity. This Technical Report explains the principles of the ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008
    (GUM), its Supplement 1:2008 (GUM S1) and the special considerations necessary
    for radiation protection at an example taken from individual dosimetry of external
    radiation. This Technical Report is intended to assist the understanding of the
    ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 (GUM), its Supplement 1: 2008 (GUM S1). The main changes
    with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- add to the analytical
    method for the determination of uncertainty the Monte Carlo method for the determination
    of uncertainty according to supplement 1 of the Guide to the Expression of uncertainty
    in measurement (GUM S1), and<br />\r\n- add a very simple method to judge whether
    a measured result is significantly different from zero based on ISO 11929."
