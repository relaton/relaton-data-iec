abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>For each of the function syntaxes
    in clauses 5 and 6 of ISO/IEC 9636-2 to 9636-6, an encoding is specified in terms
    of an opcode and a sequence of parameters of specified data types. For each of
    these data types, an explicit representation in terms of bits, 8-bit and 16-bit
    entities is specified. This binary encoding will, in many circumstances, reduce
    the effort required to generate and interpret the data stream as compared to other
    encodings.</p>
