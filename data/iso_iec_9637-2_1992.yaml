abstract:
- content: For each of the function syntaxes in clauses 5 and 6 of ISO/IEC 9636-2
    to 9636-6, an encoding is specified in terms of an opcode and a sequence of parameters
    of specified data types. For each of these data types, an explicit representation
    in terms of bits, 8-bit and 16-bit entities is specified. This binary encoding
    will, in many circumstances, reduce the effort required to generate and interpret
    the data stream as compared to other encodings.
