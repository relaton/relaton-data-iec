abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-4:2015(E) provides a method for describing the results to
    be achieved by the electrification system independently of the technical solutions
    that could be implemented. The purpose is to provide a method to assist project
    contractors and project developers to select and design the electrification system
    for isolated sites while matching the identified needs, such as those described
    in IEC TS 62257-2. The main technical changes with regard to the previous edition
    are as follows:<br />\r\n- redefine the maximum AC voltage from 500 V to 1 000
    V, the maximum DC voltage from 750 V to 1 500 V;<br />\r\n- removal of the limitation
    of 100 kVA system size.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 62257 series."
