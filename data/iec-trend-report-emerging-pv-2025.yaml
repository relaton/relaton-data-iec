  content: "The world is rapidly transitioning to a clean energy future, with renewables
    expected to contribute to nearly 50% of the global electricity mix by 2030. A
    key driver for clean energy and net-zero goals is photovoltaic (PV) technology,
    which allows harvesting solar energy for our electricity needs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAccording
    to a study cited in the report, the global installed capacity of PV systems has
    grown from 1.2 TW in 2022 to 1.6 TW in 2023. Emerging PV technologies are set
    to further revolutionize the new energy sector by reducing costs, improving efficiency,
    and expanding applications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAmidst rapid development in the
    photovoltaic industry, this societal and technology trend report serves as a systematic
    summary of the history, status, and key technologies of emerging photovoltaics.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThe report examines emerging PV technologies like perovskite,
    organic, and quantum-dot PV materials, with a primary focus on perovskites, one
    of the fastest-developing and most promising technologies. It evaluates real-world
    application scenarios, highlights key challenges including in performance and
    manufacturing, and aims to aid the IEC and partners in understanding and supporting
    these technologies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology trend
    report was developed by the Societal and Technology Trend Working Group (STTWG)
    in the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">MSB</a>),
    and is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/emerging-photovoltaic-materials-and-technologies\">free
