  content: "IEC/TR 60919-1:2010+A1:2013+A2:2017 provides general guidance on the steady-state
    performance requirements of HVDC systems. It concerns the steady-state performance
    of two-terminal HVDC systems utilizing 12-pulse converter units comprised of three-phase
    bridge (double- way) connections, but it does not cover multi-terminal HVDC transmission
    systems. Both terminals are assumed to use thyristor valves as the main semiconductor
    valves and to have power flow capability in both directions. Diode valves are
    not considered in this report. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the changes
    have been made to the description of multi 12-pulse groups per pole, especially
    for a large scale ultra high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) converter arrangement;<br
    />\r\nb) the different arrangements of d.c. smoothing reactors have been included;<br
    />\r\nc) the figures depicting two 12-pulse groups per pole arrangement have been
    added.<br />\r\n<strong>This consolidated version consists of the third edition
    (2010), its amendment 1 (2013) and its amendment 2 (2017). Therefore, no need
    to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>"
