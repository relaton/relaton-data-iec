abstract:
- content: "IEC 61631:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61631:2020
    specifies a test method for the mechanical strength of cores made of magnetic
    oxides. This test method is suitable for most of the E-cores, ETD-cores, I-cores
    and ring-cores but other core types such as U-cores could be tested according
    to a derived method agreed by the parties concerned. This document is also applicable
    to the mechanical strength measurement of magnetic powder cores. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- the phrase: \"This document is also applicable to the mechanical
    strength measurement of magnetic powder cores\" has been added in the scope;<br
    />\r\n- IEC 61246 has been replaced by IEC 63093-8; EN 1002-2 has been replaced
    by ISO 7500-1; ISO 4677-1 and ISO 4677-2 have been withdrawn;<br />\r\n- dimensions
    D and F in Figure A.1 and Table A.1 have been changed to be consistent with Figure
    1 of IEC 63093-8:2018;<br />\r\n- addition of the content of ring-cores test;<br
    />\r\n- addition of Annex B;<br />\r\n- the location of the jig is amended in
    Figure 3;<br />\r\n- in Figure 5, the roller bars are moved to the edge of the
    I-core, aligned with the core."
