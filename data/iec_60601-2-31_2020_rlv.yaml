abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-2-31:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60601-2-31:2020 applies
    to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of EXTERNAL PACEMAKERS powered by
    an INTERNAL ELECTRICAL POWER SOURCE, hereafter referred to as ME EQUIPMENT. This
    document applies to PATIENT CABLES as defined in 201.3.209, but does not apply
    to LEADS as defined in 201.3.206. HAZARDS inherent in the intended physiological
    function of ME EQUIPMENT within the scope of this document are not covered by
    specific requirements in this document except in 7.2.13 and 8.4.1 of the general
    standard. This document does not apply to the implantable parts of ACTIVE IMPLANTABLE
    MEDICAL DEVICES covered by ISO 14708-1. This document does not apply to EXTERNAL
    PACEMAKERS which can be connected directly or indirectly to a SUPPLY MAINS. This
    document does not apply to transthoracic and oesophageal pacing ME EQUIPMENT and
    antitachycardia ME EQUIPMENT. IEC 60601-2-31:2020 cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2008 and Amendment 1:2011. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The requirement for testing for energy
    reduction has been removed;<br />\r\nb) The test for exposure to external defibrillation
    has been completely revised;<br />\r\nc) The exclusion for testing ESD immunity
    only with respect to air discharges has been removed;<br />\r\nd) Alignment with
    the latest edition of ISO 14708-2 for pacemakers, as well as the associated EMC
    standard ISO 14117;<br />\r\ne) Additional rationale for all changes.</p>"
