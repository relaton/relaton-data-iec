abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document specifies mechanisms
    that generate, renew, and verify independent time-stamps. In order to verify an
    independent time-stamp token, time-stamp verifiers do not need access to any other
    time-stamp tokens. That is, such time-stamp tokens are not linked.</p>
