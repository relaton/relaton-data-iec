  content: "IEC TS 63394:2023 In the context of the safety of machinery, the sector
    standard IEC 62061, along with ISO 13849 1, provides requirements to manufacturers
    of machines for the design, development and integration of safety-related control
    systems (SCS) or safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS), depending on
    technology used (mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electrical technologies)
    to perform safety function(s). This document does not replace ISO 13849-1 and
    IEC 62061. This document gives additional guidance to the application of IEC 62061
    or ISO 13849-1.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n– gives guidelines and specifies
    additional requirements for specific safety functions based on the methodology
    of ISO 12100, which are relevant in machinery and respecting typical boundary
    conditions of machinery;<br />\r\n– considers safety functions which are designed
    for high demand mode of operation yet are rarely operated, called rarely activated
    safety functions;<br />\r\n– gives additional information for the calculation
    of failure rates using other (non-electronic) technologies based e.g. on Weibull
    distribution, because all the formula defined in IEC 62061 and ISO 13849-1 are
    based on exponential distribution.<br />\r\nTherefore, the basis for these guidelines
    and additional requirements is<br />\r\n– a typical classification of safety functions;<br
    />\r\n– a consideration of typical architectures used for designing safety functions;<br
    />\r\n– a consideration of modes of operation of safety functions;<br />\r\n–
    the derivation and evaluation of PFH formulas for subsystems considering the used
    technology.<br />\r\nThis document does not address low demand mode of operation
    according to IEC 61508.<br />\r\nThis document does not take into account either
    layer of protection analysis (LOPA) or basic process control system (BPCS), according
    to IEC 61511 as a risk reduction measure.<br />\r\nThis document considers all
    lifecycle phases of the machine regarding functional safety, and SCS or SRP/CS."
