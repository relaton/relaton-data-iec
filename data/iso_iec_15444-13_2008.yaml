abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15444-13:2008 defines a normative entry level JPEG 2000 encoder
    providing one or more optional complete encoding paths that use various features
    defined in ISO/IEC 15444. It provides for an entry-level encoder that can be used
    in various applications with guidelines on its use, based on patents for which
    royalty and license fee free declarations are available.ISO/IEC 15444-13:2008
    defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding
    bi-level, continuous-tone greyscale, palletized colour, or continuous-tone colour
    digital still images.
