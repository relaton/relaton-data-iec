abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60919-1:2020(E) provides general guidance on the steady-state performance
    requirements of high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems. It concerns the steady-state
    performance of two-terminal HVDC systems utilizing 12-pulse converter units comprised
    of three-phase bridge (double-way) connections, but it does not cover multiÂ­terminal
    HVDC transmission systems. Both terminals are assumed to use thyristor valves
    as the main semiconductor valves and to have power flow capability in both directions.
    Diode valves are not considered in this document. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Figure 8 and Figure 20 have been updated, a new Figure 18 \"LCC/VSC hybrid bipolar
    system\" has been added;<br />\r\n- the HVDC system control objectives have been
    supplemented;<br />\r\n- additional explanations regarding the HVDC system control
    structure have been given;<br />\r\n- a new subclause 13.6 on HVDC system protection
    has been added."
