abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19752:2004 is limited to evaluation of toner cartridge yield
    for toner containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and toner cartridges
    without a photoconductor) for monochrome electrophotographic printers. ISO/IEC
    19752:2004 can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional
    device that has a digital input-printing path (i.e. multi-function devices that
    contain printer components).</p><p>ISO/IEC 19752:2004 is only intended for the
    measurement of toner cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from this testing
    regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p>"
