  content: "IEC 61196-11:2022 specifies the general requirements of semi-rigid coaxial
    communication cables with polyethylene (PE) dielectric, including material and
    construction, IEC type designation, identification, marking and labelling, standard
    ratings and characteristics, requirements of finished cables, quality assessment,
    delivery and storage, etc.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 61196 applies to semi-rigid
    coaxial communication cables with polyethylene (PE) dielectric and tubular outer
    conductor. These cables are widely used in the interconnection between wireless
    communication equipment and antenna, as well as RF and microwave electronic equipment,
    broadcast television, microwave relay, navigation, etc.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. The scope is more detailed.<br />\r\nb. Outer diameter ratings of the
    inner conductor recommended.<br />\r\nc. Dielectric: outer diameter ratings of
    the dielectric recommended.<br />\r\nd. IEC type designation introduced.<br />\r\ne.
    Standard ratings and characteristics: completely revised.<br />\r\nf. Requirements
    of finished cables: completely revised."
