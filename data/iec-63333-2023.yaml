  content: "IEC 63333:2023 deals with the assessment of the proportion of reused components
    in products on a horizontal level, which can be applied at any point in the life
    of the product. This document applies to electrical and electronic products. It
    can also be applied to other product types.<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    to be used in the assessment of the proportion of reused components in products.
    It can also be used by technical committees when developing assessment methods
    dedicated to their product or product-group publications. Aspects like performance,
    validation, verification and suitability of reused components are not in the scope
    of this document. It is the responsibility of the user of this document to address
    these aspects. This document has the status of a horizontal publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 108."
