    <p>ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004 specifies the structure and uses of the ISO base media file format. The identical text is published as ISO/IEC 15444-12:2004. This file format is used to contain time-based media such as video and audio. The storage of particular coding schemes is defined in specifications that derive from and reference ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004 and ISO/IEC 15444-12:2004, such as the MPEG-4 file format specified in ISO/IEC 14496-14, or the Motion JPEG file format specified in ISO/IEC 15444-3:2002/Amd.2.</p>
    <p>This file format is designed to contain timed media information for a presentation in a flexible, extensible format that facilitates interchange, management, editing and presentation of the media. This presentation may be "local" to the system containing the presentation, or may be via a network or other stream delivery mechanism. The file format is designed to be independent of any particular network protocol while enabling efficient support for them in general.</p>
    <p>The file structure is object-oriented; a file can be decomposed into constituent objects very simply, and the structure of the objects inferred directly from their type.</p>
    <p>This technically identical text is published as ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004 for MPEG-4, and as ISO/IEC 15444-12:2004 for JPEG 2000, and reference to this specification should be made accordingly. The recommendation is to reference one, for example ISO/IEC 14496-12:2004, and append to the reference a parenthetical comment identifying the other, for example "(technically identical to ISO/IEC 15444-12:2004)".</p>
