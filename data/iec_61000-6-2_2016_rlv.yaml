abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-6-2:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-6-2:2016 for
    EMC immunity requirements applies to electrical and electronic equipment intended
    for use in industrial locations, as described below. Immunity requirements in
    the frequency range 0 Hz to 400 GHz are covered. No tests need to be performed
    at frequencies where no requirements are specified. This generic EMC immunity
    standard is applicable if no relevant dedicated product or product-family EMC
    immunity standard exists. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
