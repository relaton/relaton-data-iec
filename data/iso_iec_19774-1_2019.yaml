abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a systematic system for representing humanoids
    in a network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia environment. Conceptually, each
    humanoid is an articulated character that can be embedded in different representation
    systems and animated using the facilities provided by the representation system.
    This document specifies the abstract form and structure of humanoids.<br />\r\nFurther,
    this document specifies the semantics of humanoid animation as an abstract functional
    behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia articulated characters. This
    document does not define physical shapes for such characters but does specify
    how such characters can be structured for animation.<br />\r\nThis document is
    intended for a wide variety of presentation systems and applications, providing
    wide latitude in interpretation and implementation of the functionality."
