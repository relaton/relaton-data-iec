abstract:
- content: IEC 62906-5-1:2021(E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measurement methods for front projection displays without screen which use lasers
    or laser hybrids as light sources. The hybrid light sources can use both lasers
    and spontaneous emission-based light sources. This document covers optical performance
    measurements for full-frame projection technologies such as digital micro mirror
    devices (DMDs), liquid crystal on silicon (LCOS), and liquid crystal display (LCD)
    projectors. Other displays, such as raster-scanned (flying spot) projection displays,
    are not included.
