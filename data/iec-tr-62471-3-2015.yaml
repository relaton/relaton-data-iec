  content: IEC TR 62471-3:2015(E) which is a technical report, provides guidelines
    for the safe use of intense pulsed light (IPL) source equipment in professional
    premises. It describes possible adverse incidents that may occur in respect of
    the use of IPL devices and recommends measures to avoid them. IEC TR 62471-3:2015
    sets out the control measures recommended for the safety of recipients of IPL
    treatment, staff, service, maintenance personnel and others. Engineering controls
    which form part of the IPL equipment or the installation are also briefly described
    to provide an understanding of the general principles of protection.
