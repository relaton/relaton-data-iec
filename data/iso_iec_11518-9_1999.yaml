abstract:
- content: Defines a physical-level interface for transmitting digital data at 800
    Mbit&#x2F;s or 1 600 Mbit&#x2F;s serially over fibre-optic cables across distances
    of up to 10 km. The signalling sequences and protocol used are compatible with
    HIPPI-PH, ISO&#x2F;IEC 11518-1, which is limited to 25 m distances. HIPPI-Serial
    may be integrated as a host&#x27;s native interface, or used as an external extender
    for HIPPI-PH ports.
