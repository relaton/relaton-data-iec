    <p>This Technical Report (TR) analyses the requirements for the standardization of networking functions to support</p>
    <p>mobility within one or more Private Integrated Network Exchanges (PINXs) of a Private Integrated Services Network</p>
    <p>(PISN).It covers both Wireless Terminal Mobility (WTM) and Private Personal Mobility (PPM).</p>
    <p>WTM is a function that allows users of Wireless Terminals (WT) to make and receive calls at any compatible radio</p>
    <p>access within the network. Standards for WTM should be independent of the access technology used to support the</p>
    <p>WTs.</p>
    <p>PPM enables users of a PISN to register at any suitable terminal (wired or wireless) within the network for the</p>
    <p>making and/or receiving of calls.</p>
    <p>This Technical Report covers the following subjects for both WTM and PPM:</p>
    <p>- Registration procedures;</p>
    <p>- Procedures for incoming and outgoing calls;</p>
    <p>- Access security procedures (identification and authentication);</p>
    <p>- Requirements for numbering, addressing and signalling;</p>
    <p>- Requirements for management, administration and operation.</p>
