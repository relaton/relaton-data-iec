  content: "IEC TS 62257-9-2:2016(E) specifies microgrids made of overhead lines because
    of technical and economical reasons in the context of decentralized rural electrification.
    The microgrids covered by this part of IEC 62257 are low voltage AC, three-phase
    or single-phase, with rated capacity less than or equal to 100 kVA. They are powered
    by a single micropower plant. The main technical changes with regard to the previous
    edition are as follows: changing the voltage range covered by the technical specification
    to AC nominal voltage below 1 000 V and DC nominal voltage below 1 500 V.<br />\r\n<br
