abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/TR 20000-5:2013 is an exemplar implementation plan providing guidance
    on how to implement a service management system (SMS) to fulfil the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. The intended users of ISO/IEC/TR 20000-5:2013 are service
    providers, but it can also be useful for those advising service providers on how
    to implement an SMS. ISO/IEC/TR 20000-5:2013 includes advice for service providers
    on a suitable order in which to plan, implement and improve an SMS using, as an
    example, a generic three-phased approach to manage the implementation. The service
    provider can choose their own sequence to implement the SMS. Also included is
    advice on the development of a business case, the project initiation and other
    activities that are recommended for the implementation to be successful. The phases
    described in ISO/IEC/TR 20000-5:2013 do not include changes to the intended scope
    of the service provider's SMS. The scope itself is not subject to phased changes
    as a result of adopting the advice in ISO/IEC/TR 20000-5:2013. Instead, each phase
    should improve the SMS in alignment with the service provider's agreed scope,
    building on the results of the previous phase. The main activities for the development
    of the business case and initiation of the implementation project are shown. The
    main activities to implement the SMS based on ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011, in three phases,
    are listed. Many of the activities described in ISO/IEC/TR 20000-5:2013 are intended
    to be met by actions over more than one phase, with each phase building upon the
    achievements of the earlier phase. Once the final phase is completed, the service
    provider's organization can achieve the benefits of an SMS that meets the requirements
    in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011. Supporting information for the SMS implementation project
    is also provided. Examples of policies to illustrate what a service provider can
    want to put in place are provided. Because policies depend on the organization
    and the strategy of the service provider, these example policies can be tailored
    to suit the organizational requirement. Guidance on documentation management is
    provided, and templates are included for some of the documents specified in ISO/IEC
    20000-1:2011 that can be amended to suit individual circumstances.
