abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18046-4:2015 defines test methods for performance characteristics
    of HF RFID gates in libraries for item management and specifies the general requirements
    and test requirements for HF RFID gates in libraries which are applicable to the
    selection of the gates for an application. The summary of the test reports form
    a unified tag datasheet. It does not apply to testing in relation to regulatory
    or similar requirements.
