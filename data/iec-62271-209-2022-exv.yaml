  content: "IEC 62271-209:2022 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62271-209:2022 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62271-1:2017+AMD1:2021 CSV and IEC 62271-203:2011.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC
    62271-209:2022+AMD1:2021 CSV covers the connection assembly of fluid-filled and
    extruded cables to gas-insulated metal enclosed switchgear (GIS), in single- or
    three-phase arrangements where the cable terminations are fluid-filled or dry-type
    and there is a separating insulating barrier between the cable insulation and
    the gas insulation of the switchgear. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) New numbering in accordance with ISO/IEC
    directives, Part 2 (2016) and to IEC 62271‑1:2017;<br />\r\nb) Clause 3: addition
    of a definition for plug-in cable termination, filling pressure and minimum function
    pressure for insulation;<br />\r\nc) Clause 7: An additional dielectric type test
    for plug-in cable termination was added; also a pressure type test as well as
    a leak rate test on the insulator of a cable termination was implemented;<br />\r\nd)
    Clause 12: New clause about safety practices;<br />\r\ne) Clause 13: New clause
    about influence of the product on the environment;<br />\r\nf) New informative
    Annex A: Mechanical forces applied on the flange of the cable connection enclosure."
