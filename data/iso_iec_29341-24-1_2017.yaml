abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-24-1:2017 specifies the characteristics of a device that manages connectivity
    to the Internet as an \"edge\" device between a residential Local Area Network
    and a Wide Area Network. The gateway can be physically implemented as a standalone
    device, or logically as a set of UPnP devices and services on a PC. This specified
    device is intended to be controlled from inside the home network. Control from
    outside the home network typically requires access control mechanisms that are
    outside the scope of this document. This specified device is also not intended
    for use with small business networks.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29341-24-1:2017 defines
    version 2 of the device named InternetGatewayDevice. It is a UPnP root device,
    and is identified by the UPnP device type InternetGatewayDevice:2. It is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture, Versions 1.0 and 1.1 ([15] and [16], respectively).
    InternetGatewayDevice:2 encapsulates several sub-devices and services that collectively
    comprise the Internet Gateway Device Control Protocol (DCP)."
