- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005 specifies:</p><ul><li>contents of command-response

    to describe operating characteristics of the card,</li><li>structures for applications
    and data in the card, as seen at the interface when processing commands,</li><li>access
    methods to files and data in the card,</li><li>a security architecture defining
