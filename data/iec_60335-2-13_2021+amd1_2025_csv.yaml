abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-13:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of electric deep
    fat fryers having a recommended maximum quantity of oil not exceeding 5 l, frying
    pans, woks and other appliances in which oil is used for cooking, and intended
    for household use and similar use, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V. Appliances intended for normal household and similar use and that may also
    be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms are within the scope
    of this standard. However, if the appliance is intended to be used professionally
    to process food for commercial consumption, the appliance is not considered to
    be for household and similar use only. As far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nHowever, in general, it does not
    take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory
    or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from
    using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children
    playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n–
    for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– deep fat fryers for commercial use (IEC
    60335-2-37);<br />\r\n– commercial multi-purpose cooking pans (IEC 60335-2-39);<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and
    replaces the sixth edition published in 2009 and Amendment 1:2016. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been
    converted to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 5.101, 7.12, 15.101, 22.35, 24.1.5);<br
    />\r\nc) exclusion of battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) an additional
    test has been introduced to limit the temperature rise of external accessible
    surfaces including marking of hot surfaces (Clause 7, Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis
    Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
