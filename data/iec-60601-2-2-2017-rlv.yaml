  content: "IEC 60601-2-2:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-2:2017
    applies to the basic safety and essential performance of HF surgical equipment
    and HF surgical accessories.<br />\r\nHF surgical equipment having a rated output
    power not exceeding 50 W (for example for micro-coagulation, or for use in dentistry
    or ophthalmology) is exempt from certain of the requirements of this particular
    standard. These exemptions are indicated in the relevant requirements.<br />\r\nThe
    object of this particular standard is to establish particular basic safety and
    essential performance requirements for HF surgical equipment and HF surgical accessories.
    This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2009. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    refinement and additions to the defined terms;<br />\r\n- additional separation
    of the requirements for HF surgical equipment and HF surgical accessories;<br
    />\r\n- a new requirement for adult neutral electrodes to be contact quality monitoring
    neutral electrodes;<br />\r\n- new requirements for devices that have or use a
    high current mode."
