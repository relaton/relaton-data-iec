abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63163:2021 is intended to apply to terrestrial modules for consumer
    applications for outdoor operation shorter than those qualified to IEC 61215.
    The useful service life of modules so qualified depends on their design, their
    environment and the conditions under which they are operated. This document classes
    those PV modules into Category 1, Category 2, and Category 3 with respectively
    low, medium and high expected outdoor exposure. This specification is intended
    to qualify the PV portion of these devices. It may, however, be used as a basis
    for testing such PV modules, but does not qualify the electronic portion. The
    purpose of the test sequence is to determine the electrical, thermal, and mechanical
    durability characteristics of the module, and to show that the module is capable
    of withstanding outdoor exposure for different outdoor durations designated as
    “low”, “medium”, and “high”. Mobile and attached applications are considered to
    require lower mechanical durability than portable applications, which are more
    prone to mechanical damage.
