abstract:
- content: Specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics. Also specifies the
    quality of the recorded signals, the recorded format and the recording method,
    thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape
    cartridges. Specifies two types of cartridges referred to as type A (magnetic
    tape of nominal thickness of 13 µm and a nominal length of up to 60,5 m) and type
    B (magnetic tape of a nominal thickness of 9 µm and a nominal length of up to
    92,0 m).
