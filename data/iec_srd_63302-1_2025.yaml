abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63302-1:2025 provides use case collection and analysis, identifies
    the market relationships of relevant stakeholders, scopes out capabilities and
    a reference model of intelligent operations centre (IOC) for smart cities, and
    proposes the requirements for standards development in this field.<br />\r\nDigital
    solutions are accelerating the integration of real world applications in urban
    areas, including city governance, healthcare, environment, traffic, education,
    security and so on. However, many smart solutions are still implemented within
    single-domains. Isolated city services, data flows and data need integration.
    To be effective, the coordination of data and service requires an overarching
    framework coupled with an intelligent operations centre. The first step to identify
    solution options is by collecting and analysing relevant use cases.<br />\r\nIOC
    is tailored to provide urban managers, enterprises and citizens with access to
    operational and organized solutions. Based on city-level database and new technologies,
    such as big data, AI, cloud computing, blockchain etc., IOC processes city information
    and provides innovative services for urban managers, operators and other stakeholders.
    Compared with single-domain systems, IOC can better support monitoring and visualizing,
    decision making and cross-domain cooperation. IOC will play an important role
    in integrating city services such as police, health services traffic management
    and rescue services, including but not limited to the following methods.<br />\r\na)
    The centralized operations dashboard and mobile application will allow real-time
    monitoring and information processing to improve response to emergencies.<br />\r\nb)
    The centralized and intelligent platform will enable noticeable improvements in
    the management of public safety, like crime prevention, emergency response, threat
    prevention and response, and traffic management.<br />\r\nc) The IOC's technologically
    advanced analysis, integrated communications, GPS and video surveillance capabilities
    will help residents and domain (energy, water, horticulture, waste and security)
    supervisors to collaborate in a smarter way.<br />\r\nd) The integrated data visualization,
    near real-time collaboration and deep analytics it provides will help agencies
    prepare for problems, coordinate and manage response efforts and enhance the efficiency
    of services,<br />\r\ne) IOC will enable residents to report issues such as broken
    street lights, electricity failure, water wastage, etc. and check resolution status
    using their mobile devices.<br />\r\nCurrently, IOC solutions are being implemented
    in different cities around the world, and the stakeholders of these smart cities
    face similar challenges, including cross-domain cooperation, monitoring and visualizing,
    intelligent analysis, user-oriented experience, etc. The provision of standardization
    should be considered as one of key factors to support IOC development, including
    the development of the conceptual model, data exchange, IT infrastructures, services,
    and so on. This document focuses on collecting and analysing use cases from diversified
    areas, with the goal of developing consensus-based descriptions of IOC features
    and capabilities across all stakeholders, and uses this to scope out the standardization
    requirements related to the field of IOC.<br />\r\nThis document is for use by
    authorities, solution providers, utilities, citizens, and other relevant stakeholders,
    to identify good practices regarding IOC, and how they can implement them."
