abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 24716:2007 specifies the syntax and semantics for XML support
    in COBOL. The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 24716:2007 is to promote a high degree of
    portability in implementations, even though some elements are subject to trial
    before completion of a final design suitable for standardization.This specification
    builds on the syntax and semantics defined in ISO/IEC 1989:2002.
