  content: "IEC 60079-0:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60079-0:2017
    specifies the general requirements for construction, testing and marking of Ex
    Equipment and Ex Components intended for use in explosive atmospheres. The standard
    atmospheric conditions (relating to the explosion characteristics of the atmosphere)
    under which it may be assumed that Ex Equipment can be operated are:<br />\r\n-temperature
    –20 °C to +60 °C;<br />\r\n-pressure 80 kPa (0,8 bar) to 110 kPa (1,1 bar); and<br
    />\r\n-air with normal oxygen content, typically 21 % v/v.<br />\r\nThis part
    of IEC 60079 and other standards supplementing this standard specify additional
    test requirements for Ex Equipment operating outside the standard temperature
    range, but further additional consideration and additional testing may be required
    for Ex Equipment operating outside the standard atmospheric pressure range and
    standard oxygen content. Such additional testing may be particularly relevant
    with respect to Types of Protection that depend on quenching of a flame such as
    ‘flameproof enclosures “d”’ (IEC 60079-1) or limitation of energy, ‘intrinsic
    safety “i”’ (IEC 60079-11). This seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth
    edition, published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. Refer
    to the Foreword of the document for a complete listing of the technical changes
    between edition 7.0 and the previous edition of the document.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords:
    Ex Equipment and Ex Components intended for use in explosive atmospheres<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the interpretation sheet 1 of April 2019, of the interpretation sheet
    2 of June 2019 and the corrigendum 1 of January 2020 have been included in this
    copy."
