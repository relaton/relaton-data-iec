  content: "IEC 60384-24:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60384-24:2021 applies
    to fixed tantalum electrolytic surface mount capacitors with conductive polymer
    solid electrolyte, which are primarily intended for DC applications for use in
    electronic equipment. The object of this document is to prescribe preferred ratings
    and characteristics and to select from IEC 60384-1:2016 the appropriate quality
    assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance
    requirements for this type of capacitor. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Revision of
    the structure in accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2018, to the extent
    practicable, and harmonization between other similar kinds of documents.<br />\r\n-
    In addition, Clause 5 and all the tables have been reviewed in order to prevent
    duplications and contradictions.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
