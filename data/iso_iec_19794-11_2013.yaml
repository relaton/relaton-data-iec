abstract:
- content: For the purpose of biometric comparison, ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013 specifies
    a data interchange format for processed signature/sign behavioural data extracted
    from a time series, captured using devices such as digitizing tablets, pen-based
    computing devices, or advanced pen systems.  The data interchange format is generic,
    in that it may be applied and used in a wide range of application areas where
    handwritten signs or signature/signs are involved. No application-specific requirements
    or features are addressed in ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013.  ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013 contains
    definitions of relevant terms, a description of what data is extracted, and a
    data format for containing the data, together with advice on whether a set of
    user's signature/sign is suitable for identification purposes using ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013.  It
    is advisable that stored and transmitted biometric data is time-stamped and that
    cryptographic techniques be used to protect their authenticity, integrity, and
    confidentiality; however, such provisions are beyond the scope of ISO/IEC 19794-11:2013.
