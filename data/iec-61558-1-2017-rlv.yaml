  content: "IEC 61558-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61558-1:2017
    deals with safety aspects of transformers, reactors, power supply units and combinations
    thereof such as electrical, thermal and mechanical safety. This document covers
    the following independent or associated stationary or portable types of dry-type
    transformers, power supply units, including switch mode power supply units, reactors
    and combinations thereof in the field of safety. The windings can be encapsulated
    or non-encapsulated. They are not forming a part of the distribution network.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2005 and
    Amendment 1:2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na. fully insulated winding wires (FIW), new tables and aging
    tests for FIW constructions,<br />\r\nb. overvoltage categories 1, 2, 3 and 4
    for clearances and dielectric strength tests (new tables) are included,<br />\r\nc.
    development of new symbols for the different overvoltage categories,<br />\r\nd.
    symbol for maximum altitudes, if higher than 2 000 m,<br />\r\ne. symbol for plug
    in power supply units, if the pins are damaged (tumbling barrel test),<br />\r\nf.
    symbol for minimum temperature (even during the transportation),<br />\r\ng. alternative
    temperature measurement, simulated load and back to back method according to IEC
    60076-11,<br />\r\nh. short circuit and overload protection, simulated load and
    back to back method according to IEC 60076-11,<br />\r\ni. adjustment of temperatures
    in Table 2 according to CENELEC Guide 29,<br />\r\nj. establishing partial discharge
    test above 750 V for FIW constructions,<br />\r\nk. requirements for toroidal
    core constructions, division for basic and for supplementary isolation,<br />\r\nl.
    modification of protection indexes for enclosures (IP-code),<br />\r\nm. dimensioning
    of rectangular cross section connectors for transformers,<br />\r\nn. repetition
    test, 80% of required dielectric strength test voltage of Table 14,a.<br />\r\no.
    vibration test for vehicles and railway applications,<br />\r\np. two Y1 Capacitors
    for working voltages above 250 V and not exceeding 500 V with overvoltage category
    3.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with
    IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-12) has been included
    in this copy."
