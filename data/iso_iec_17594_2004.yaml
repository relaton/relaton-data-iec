abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17594:2004 specifies the characteristics of a case for use
    with the 120 mm and 80 mm DVD-RAM disks specified in ISO/IEC 17592. ISO/IEC 17594:2004
    specifies nine related, but different implementations of this case.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    17594:2004 specifies:</p><ul><li>the environments in which the cases are to be
    operated and stored;</li><li>the dimensional and mechanical characteristics of
    the case, so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing
    systems.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 17594:2004 provides for mechanical interchange between
    optical disk drives. Together with ISO/IEC 17592 for 120 mm (4,7 Gbytes per side)
    and 80 mm (1,46 Gbytes per side) DVD-RAM disks and a standard for volume and file
    structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
