abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    17594:2004 specifies the characteristics of a case for use with the 120 mm and
    80 mm DVD-RAM disks specified in ISO/IEC 17592. ISO/IEC 17594:2004 specifies nine
    related, but different implementations of this case.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 17594:2004
    specifies:\r\n\r\n\tthe environments in which the cases are to be operated and
    stored;\r\n\tthe dimensional and mechanical characteristics of the case, so as
    to provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC
    17594:2004 provides for mechanical interchange between optical disk drives. Together
    with ISO/IEC 17592 for 120 mm (4,7 Gbytes per side) and 80 mm (1,46 Gbytes per
    side) DVD-RAM disks and a standard for volume and file structure, it provides
    for full data interchange between data processing systems."
