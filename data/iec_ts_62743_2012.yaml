abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62743:2012(E) applies to all types of counting dosemeters, irrespective
    of the measuring quantity and the type of radiation intended to be measured. It
    ensures that a single radiation pulse can be correctly measured even if the dosemeter
    is in the internal state relevant for measuring background or environmental radiation.
    The characteristics of the dosemeter for repeated pulses is expected to be better
    than for one single radiation pulse with the same parameters but worse than for
    continuous radiation, i.e., in between of the characteristics for these two extreme
    conditions. Considers the pulsation of the radiation field as an additional influence
    quantity like particle energy and direction of radiation incidence. Therefore,
    the tests described are additional to all the tests in the respective standards.
