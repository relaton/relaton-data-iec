abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document describes a set of useful activities,
    tasks, methods, and practices that acquirers of software and related services
    from unrelated (external) suppliers can apply to help ensure an efficient and
    effective acquisition of software or software services. These practices can be
    applied in competitive and in sole source procurements, regardless of the type,
    size, complexity, and cost of the acquisition. The document can be applied to
    software that runs on any computer system regardless of its size, complexity,
    or criticality. The software supply chain can include integration of off-the-shelf
    (OTS), custom, software as a service (SaaS), or open-source software. Software
    services can include software development and sustainment (maintenance), integration,
    verification (testing) and operation. Security and safety are included as attributes
    to be considered during the acquisition. However, specific requirements for acquisition
    of information assurance (security), safety, and cloud services are not included.</p>
