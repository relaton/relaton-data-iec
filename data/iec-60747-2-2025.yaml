  content: "IEC 60747-2:2025 specifies product specific standards for terminology,
    letter symbols, essential ratings and characteristics (properties), measuring
    and test methods, requirements for type tests, routine tests, endurance tests
    and marking for the following discrete semiconductor devices:<br />\r\n- generic
    rectifier diodes;<br />\r\n- avalanche rectifier diodes;<br />\r\n- fast-switching
    rectifier diodes;<br />\r\n- Schottky barrier diodes.<br />\r\nIf no ambiguity
    is likely to result, any of the above will be referred to as diodes.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the terms and definitions for partial thermal resistance
    junction-to-case have been added;<br />\r\nb) Clauses 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 have been
    amended with some deletions of information no longer in use and with some necessary
    additions."
