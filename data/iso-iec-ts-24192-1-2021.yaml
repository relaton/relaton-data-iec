    <p>This document defines the technical requirements to be met by contactless public transport (PT) devices in order to be able to interface together using the ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts) contactless communications protocol.</p>
    <p>This document applies to PT devices:</p>
    <p>—    PT readers which are contactless fare management system terminals acting as a PCD contactless reader based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts);</p>
    <p>—    PT objects which are contactless fare media acting as a PICC contactless object based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts).</p>
    <p>This document addresses interoperability of consumer-market NFC mobile devices, compliant to NFC Forum specifications, with above mentioned PT devices, aligns with ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts) and does not seek to limit compliance for PT readers with EMV Contactless Interface Specification.</p>
