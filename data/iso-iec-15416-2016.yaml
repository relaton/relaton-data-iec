    <p>ISO/IEC 15416:2016:</p>
    <p>-      specifies the methodology for the measurement of specific attributes of bar code symbols;</p>
    <p>-      defines a method for evaluating these measurements and deriving an overall assessment of symbol quality; and</p>
    <p>-      provides information on possible causes of deviation from optimum grades to assist users in taking appropriate corrective action.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15416:2016 applies to those symbologies for which a reference decode algorithm has been defined, and which are intended to be read using linear scanning methods, but its methodology can be applied partially or wholly to other symbologies.</p>
