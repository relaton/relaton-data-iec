  content: "IEC 61169-24:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61169-24:2019, which
    is a sectional specification (SS), provides information and rules for the preparation
    of detail specifications (DS) for RF coaxial connectors with screw coupling, typically
    for use in 75 W cable networks (type F). It describes the interface dimensions
    with gauging information and the mandatory tests selected from IEC 61169-1, applicable
    to all DS relating to type F connectors. This specification indicates the recommended
    performance characteristics to be considered when writing a DS and covers test
    schedules and inspection requirements. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2009. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: all drawings have been
    reworked and improved to allow frequency extension up to 3 GHz.</p>"
