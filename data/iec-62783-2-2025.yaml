  content: "IEC 62783-2:2025 specifies the definitions and requirements of twin-axial
    (twinax) cables used in digital communication systems. This document covers twinax
    cable intended to be used indoors. The specifications are intended to support
    the twinax link segment specifications of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3 Ethernet over
    twinax physical layer (PHY) specifications. This document gives requirements and
    transmission characteristics for a single twinax element as well as for multiple
    twinax elements within the same sheath, i.e. \"twinax cable\". This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) updating according
    to the revised generic twinax cable requirements given in IEC 62783 1:2023;<br
    />\r\nb) updating according to new twinax link segment specifications recently
    added to ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3 Ethernet physical interfaces."
