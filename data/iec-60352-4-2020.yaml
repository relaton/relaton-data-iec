  content: "IEC 60352-4:2020 is applicable to non-accessible ID connections for which
    the tests and measurements according to Clauses 6 through 8 are suitable and which
    are made with:</br>\r\n– appropriately designed ID terminations;</br>\r\n– wires
    having solid round conductors of 0,25 mm to 3,6 mm nominal diameter;</br>\r\n–
    wires having stranded conductors of 0,05 mm2 to 10 mm2 cross-sectional area;</br>\r\nfor
    use in electrical and electronic equipment and components.</br>\r\nInformation
    on materials and data from industrial experience is included in addition to the
    test procedures to provide electrically stable connections under prescribed environmental
    conditions.</br>\r\nThere are different designs and materials for ID terminations
    in use. For this reason, only fundamental parameters of the termination are specified,
    while the performance requirements of the wire and the complete connection are
    specified in full detail.</br>\r\nThe purpose of this document is:</br>\r\n– to
    determine the suitability of non-accessible ID connections under specified mechanical,
    electrical and atmospheric conditions;</br>\r\n– to provide a means of comparing
    test results when the tools used to make the connections, if any, are of different
    designs or manufacture.</br>\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition, published in 1994, and its Amendment 1 (2000). This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.</br>\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:</br>\r\na) Transferred
    Clauses 9 to 13 into Annex A (informative).</br>\r\nb) The figures were re-drawn
    for clarity."
