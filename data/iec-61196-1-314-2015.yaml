  content: "IEC 61196-1-314:2015(E) applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies
    test methods to determine the bending tests for cables:<br />\r\n- bending around
    a test mandrel;<br />\r\n- repeated bending;<br />\r\n- repeated flexing in service;<br
    />\r\n- flexing in service;<br />\r\n- bending around rollers or bows during installation;<br
    />\r\nand for<br />\r\n- measuring the stiffness of such a cable;<br />\r\n- kink
    test.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical change
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Clause 4 (single bending test)
    was completely revised."
