abstract:
- content: "<p>Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties - the sender, the receiver, one
    or more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able
    to identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as configuration, maintenance history, address, order number, contents of
    the item, weight, sender, batch or lot number, etc.</p><p>The information is often
    held on computer systems, and may be exchanged between parties involved via EDI
    (Electronic Data Interchange) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) messages.</p><p>There
    are considerable benefits if the identity of the item is represented in bar code
    format, or other AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture) media and attached
    to or made a constituent part of that which is being uniquely identified so that</p><ul><li>it
    can be read electronically, thus minimising errors;</li><li>one identity can be
    used by all parties;</li><li>each party can use the identity to look up its computer
    files to find the data associated with the item;</li><li>the identifier is unique
    within the class and cannot appear on any other item of the class during the lifetime
    of the item.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 15459-3:2006 specifies the common rules that
    apply for unique identifiers for item management that are required to ensure full
    compatibility across classes of unique identifiers.</p>"
