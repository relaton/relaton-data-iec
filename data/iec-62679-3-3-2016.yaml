  content: IEC 62679-3-3:2016(E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measurement methods for determining the optical performance of electronic paper
    display (EPD) devices which have an operating integrated lighting unit (such as
    a front light). The scope of this document is restricted to EPDs using segmented
    or matrix structures with either monochromatic or colour type displays. The measurement
    methods are intended for EPDs operated in a reflective mode with the integrated
    lighting unit (ILU) turned on in a dark or indoor ambient lighting environment.
    Colour systems beyond three primaries are not covered in this document.
