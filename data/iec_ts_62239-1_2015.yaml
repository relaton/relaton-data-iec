abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62239-1:2015(E) defines the requirements for developing an Electronic
    Components Management Plan (ECMP) to assure customers that all of the electronic
    components in the equipment of the plan owner are selected and applied in controlled
    processes compatible with the end application and that all technical requirements
    are accomplished. This document provides an aid in the aerospace certification
    process. Although developed for the avionics industry, this process may be applied
    by other industrial sectors. This new edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous one:<br />\r\n- rationalization
    of the number of requirements;<br />\r\n- consistency in the use of certain terms;<br
    />\r\n- addition of a requirements matrix;<br />\r\n- updates to various specifications;<br
    />\r\n- addition of certain test methods."
