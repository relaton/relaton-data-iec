abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel is a high speed serial interface using either optical or
    electrical connections (i.e., the physical layer) at data rates currently up to
    2 Gbits&#x2F;s with a growth path to 10 Gbits&#x2F;s, and provides a general data
    transport vehicle for Upper Level Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral
    Interface (IPI) and Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance
    Parallel Interface (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE
    802.2, and others. The topologies supported by Fibre Channel include point-to-point,
    switched fabric, and arbitrated loop. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165 defines
    an upper-layer protocol within the domain of Fibre Channel, that is designed to
    permit efficient peer-to-peer or client-server messaging between nodes, and to
    comply with the Virtual Interface (VI) Architecture. Vendors that wish to implement
    devices that connect to FC-VI may follow the requirements of this and other normatively
    referenced standards to manufacture an FC-VI compliant device.
