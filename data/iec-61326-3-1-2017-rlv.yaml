  content: "IEC 61326-3-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61326-3-1:2017
    covers all equipment within the scope of IEC 61326-1, but is limited to systems
    and equipment for industrial applications intended to perform safety functions
    as defined in IEC 61508 with SIL 1-3.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- extension of the frequency range up
    to 6 GHz for the radio-frequency electromagnetic field test according to IEC 61000-4-3,<br
    />\r\n- replacement of the performance criterion FS with DS according to the generic
    standard IEC 61000-6-7,<br />\r\n- adding Table 1 - Aspects to be considered during
    application of performance criterion DS,<br />\r\n- including immunity tests for
    devices with current consumption > 16 A according to IEC 61000-4-34,<br />\r\n-
    updating Table 8 - Frequency ranges of mobile transmitters and ISM equipment,<br
    />\r\n- updating Figure A.1 and Figure 1 for better readability."
