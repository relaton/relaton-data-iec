abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19944:2017</p><p>- extends the existing cloud computing vocabulary
    and reference architecture in ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17789 to describe an ecosystem
    involving devices using cloud services,</p><p>- describes the various types of
    data flowing within the devices and cloud computing ecosystem,</p><p>- describes
    the impact of connected devices on the data that flow within the cloud computing
    ecosystem,</p><p>- describes flows of data between cloud services, cloud service
    customers and cloud service users,</p><p>- provides foundational concepts, including
    a data taxonomy, and</p><p>- identifies the categories of data that flow across
    the cloud service customer devices and cloud services.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19944:2017
    is applicable primarily to cloud service providers, cloud service customers and
    cloud service users, but also to any person or organization involved in legal,
    policy, technical or other implications of data flows between devices and cloud
    services.</p>"
