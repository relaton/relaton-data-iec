    involving devices using cloud services,<br />\r\n- describes the various types
    of data flowing within the devices and cloud computing ecosystem,<br />\r\n- describes
    the impact of connected devices on the data that flow within the cloud computing
    ecosystem,<br />\r\n- describes flows of data between cloud services, cloud service
    customers and cloud service users,<br />\r\n- provides foundational concepts,
    including a data taxonomy, and<br />\r\n- identifies the categories of data that
    flow across the cloud service customer devices and cloud services.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19944:2017 is applicable primarily to cloud service providers, cloud service customers
