abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-224:2019(E) defines the Small computer system interface
    (SCSI) Fibre Channel Protocol (FCP). This standard defines how the Fibre Channel
    services and the defined Information Units (IUs) are used to perform the services
    defined by the SCSI Architecture Model - 5 (SAM-5). This fourth version includes
    additions and clarifications to the third version (ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-223:2008),
    removes information that is now contained in other standards, and describes additional
    error recovery capabilities for the Fibre Channel Protocol.
