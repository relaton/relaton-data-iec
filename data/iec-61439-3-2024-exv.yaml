  content: "IEC 61439-3:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 61439-3:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 61439-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61439-3:2024 defines the specific
    requirements for distribution boards intended to be operated by ordinary persons
    (abbreviated DBO throughout this document, see 3.1.101) as follows:<br />\r\n-
    assemblies intended to be operated by ordinary persons (e.g. switching operations
    and replacing fuse-links), e.g. in domestic (household) applications;<br />\r\n-
    assemblies containing outgoing circuits with protective devices intended to be
    operated by ordinary persons, complying e.g. with IEC 60898-1, the IEC 61008 series,
    the IEC 61009 series, IEC 62606, IEC 62423 and IEC 60269-3;<br />\r\n- assemblies
    for applications where the nominal voltage to earth does not exceed 300 V AC (see
    Table G.1 of IEC 61439-1:2020);<br />\r\nNOTE The voltage limits for DC applications
    are under consideration.<br />\r\n- assemblies with a rated current (Inc) of the
    outgoing circuits not exceeding 125 A and a rated current (InA) not exceeding
    250 A;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for use in connection with the generation,
    transmission, distribution and conversion of electrical energy, and for the control
    of equipment consuming electrical energy and for associated data processing;<br
    />\r\n- enclosed, stationary assemblies;<br />\r\n- assemblies for indoor or outdoor
    use.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with the structure of IEC 61439-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    inclusion in the scope of more examples of the type of protection and control
    devices;<br />\r\nc) deletion of type A and Type B DBOs;<br />\r\nd) addition
    of a new Annex BB related to DBOs used in a prosumer’s electrical installation
    (PEI);<br />\r\ne) addition of a new Annex CC related to rated current of a DBO
    with additional source of supply in parallel/simultaneously with another source
    that is connected to the DBO e.g. PV."
