    <p>ISO/IEC TS 22237-3:2018 addresses power supplies to, and power distribution within, data centres based upon the criteria and classifications for "availability", "physical security" and "energy efficiency enablement" within ISO/IEC TS 22237‑1.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 22237-3:2018 specifies requirements and recommendations for the following:</p>
    <p>a)    power supplies to data centres;</p>
    <p>b)    power distribution systems within data centres;</p>
    <p>c)    facilities for both normal and emergency lighting;</p>
    <p>d)    equipotential bonding and earthing;</p>
    <p>e)    lightning protection;</p>
    <p>f)     devices for the measurement of the power consumption characteristics at points along the power distribution system and their integration within management tools.</p>
    <p>Safety and electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements are outside the scope of this document and are covered by other standards and regulations. However, information given in this document may be of assistance in meeting these standards and regulations.</p>
    <p>Conformance of data centres to the present document is covered in Clause 4.</p>
