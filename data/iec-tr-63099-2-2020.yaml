  content: IEC TR 63099-2:2020 provides information about the current and latest applications
    for electric-field measurement that use radio-over-fibre technologies. System
    configurations, specifications, and measurement examples of each electric-field
    measurement system are included. The theoretical background of electric-field
    measurement and calibration method of electric-field sensors are beyond the scope
    of this document.
