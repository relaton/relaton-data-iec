abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Message Waiting Indication supplementary service (SS-MWI) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected
    together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>The supplementary
    service MWI enables a Served User to be sent a Message Waiting Indication and
    also enables this Message Waiting Indication to be cancelled. The Served User
    may also be permitted to interrogate the Message Centre for any Message Waiting
    Indication.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service
    specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified
    in ETS 300 387. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification
    for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage
    1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15505.</p><p>The signalling protocol for
    SS-MWI uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary
    services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between SS-MWI and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>NOTE Additional
    interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference
    point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003
    is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
