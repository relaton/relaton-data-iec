abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 specifies the
    signalling protocol for the support of the Message Waiting Indication supplementary
    service (SS-MWI) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services
    Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services
    Network (PISN).</p><p>The supplementary service MWI enables a Served User to be
    sent a Message Waiting Indication and also enables this Message Waiting Indication
    to be cancelled. The Served User may also be permitted to interrogate the Message
    Centre for any Message Waiting Indication.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined
    in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three stages
    and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International Standard
    contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the
    requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15505.</p><p>The
    signalling protocol for SS-MWI uses certain aspects of the generic procedures
    for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15506:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the
    support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-MWI and other supplementary
    services and ANFs.</p><p>NOTE Additional interactions that have no impact on the
    signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage
    1 specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect
    to form a PISN.</p>
