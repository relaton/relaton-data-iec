abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15506:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Message Waiting
    Indication supplementary service (SS-MWI) at the Q reference point between Private
    Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private
    Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nThe supplementary service MWI enables
    a Served User to be sent a Message Waiting Indication and also enables this Message
    Waiting Indication to be cancelled. The Served User may also be permitted to interrogate
    the Message Centre for any Message Waiting Indication.<br />\r\nThe Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced
    in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International
    Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    15505.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-MWI uses certain aspects of the
    generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC
    11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15506:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol
    requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between
    SS-MWI and other supplementary services and ANFs.<br />\r\nNOTE Additional interactions
    that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be
    found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15506:2003 is applicable
    to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN."
