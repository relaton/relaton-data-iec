    <p>ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric cryptographic techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques to achieve the following goals.</p>

    Establish a shared secret key for a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em> by key agreement. In a secret key agreement mechanism, the secret key is the result of a data exchange between the two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em>. Neither of them can predetermine the value of the shared secret key.
    Establish a shared secret key for a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em> by key transport. In a secret key transport mechanism, the secret key is chosen by one entity<em>A</em> and is transferred to another entity<em>B</em>, suitably protected by asymmetric techniques.
    Make an entity's public key available to other entities by key transport. In a public key transport mechanism, the public key of entity<em>A</em> must be transferred to other entities in an authenticated way, but not requiring secrecy.<p>Some of the mechanisms of ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 are based on the corresponding authentication mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798-3.</p><p>ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not cover aspects of key management such as</p>

    key lifecycle management,
    mechanisms to generate or validate asymmetric key pairs,
    mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy, etc. keys.<p>While ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not explicitly cover the distribution of an entity's private key (of an asymmetric key pair) from a trusted third party to a requesting entity, the key transport mechanisms described can be used to achieve this. A private key can in all cases be distributed with these mechanisms where an existing, non-compromised key already exists. However, in practice the distribution of private keys is usually a manual process that relies on technological means like smart cards, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not cover the implementations of the transformations used in the key management mechanisms.</p>
