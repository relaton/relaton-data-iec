abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric
    cryptographic techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques
    to achieve the following goals.Establish a shared secret key for a symmetric cryptographic
    technique between two entities A and B by key agreement. In a secret key agreement
    mechanism, the secret key is the result of a data exchange between the two entities
    A and B. Neither of them can predetermine the value of the shared secret key.Establish
    a shared secret key for a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities
    A and B by key transport. In a secret key transport mechanism, the secret key
    is chosen by one entity A and is transferred to another entity B, suitably protected
    by asymmetric techniques.Make an entity's public key available to other entities
    by key transport. In a public key transport mechanism, the public key of entity
    A must be transferred to other entities in an authenticated way, but not requiring
    secrecy.Some of the mechanisms of ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 are based on the corresponding
    authentication mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798-3.ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not cover
    aspects of key management such askey lifecycle management,mechanisms to generate
    or validate asymmetric key pairs,mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy,
    etc. keys.While ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not explicitly cover the distribution
    of an entity's private key (of an asymmetric key pair) from a trusted third party
    to a requesting entity, the key transport mechanisms described can be used to
    achieve this. A private key can in all cases be distributed with these mechanisms
    where an existing, non-compromised key already exists. However, in practice the
    distribution of private keys is usually a manual process that relies on technological
    means like smart cards, etc.ISO/IEC 11770-3:2008 does not cover the implementations
    of the transformations used in the key management mechanisms.
