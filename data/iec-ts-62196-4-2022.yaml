  content: IEC TS 62196-4:2022(E) is applicable to plugs, socket-outlets, vehicle
    connectors and vehicle inlets, herein referred to as “accessories”, of standardized
    configuration for DC power supply of electric road vehicles, where the protection
    against electric shocks relies on double or reinforced insulation between all
    AC and DC inputs and outputs of the EV supply equipment, intended for use in conductive
    power supply systems which can incorporate control means, with a maximum operating
    voltage up to 120 V DC, not exceeding 60 A.
