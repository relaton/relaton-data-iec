    <p>The ISO/IEC TS 22424 series supports long-term preservation of EPUB publications via a dual strategy. This document considers EPUB features from a long-term preservation point of view. Some EPUB features are forbidden and some others required, depending on how they relate to a long-term preservation. EPUB publications constructed according to these guidelines are suitable for preservation.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 22424-2 makes EPUB compliant with Open Archival Information System (OAIS) and current practices of OAIS archives. </p>
