  content: "IEC 60869-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60869-1:2018
    applies to fibre optic passive power control devices. These have all of the following
    general features:<br />\r\n– they are passive in that they contain no optoelectronic
    or other transducing elements;<br />\r\n– they have two ports for the transmission
    of optical power and control of the transmitted power in a fixed or variable fashion;<br
    />\r\n– the ports are non-connectorized optical fibre pigtails, connectorized
    optical fibres or receptacles.<br />\r\nThis document establishes generic requirements
    for the following passive optical devices:<br />\r\n– optical attenuator;<br />\r\n–
    optical fuse;<br />\r\n– optical power limiter.<br />\r\nThis document also provides
    generic information including terminology for the IEC 61753-05x series. Published
    IEC 61753-05x series documents are listed in Bibliography<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2012 and constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the terms and definitions
    have been reviewed;<br />\r\nb) the requirement concerning the IEC Quality Assessment
    System has been reviewed;<br />\r\nc) the clause concerning quality assessment
    procedures has been deleted;<br />\r\nd) Annex G, relating to technical information
    on variable optical attenuators, has been added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords:
