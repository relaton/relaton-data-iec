abstract:
- content: "IEC 62629-62-11:2022 specifies the standard measuring conditions and measurement
    methods for determining the optical properties of the image created by 3D display
    devices and virtual-image optics such as head-up displays. The virtual image refers
    to an image in which the 3D visual information is superimposed with the outside
    world. Eye-wear type displays are however beyond the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒThe meaning of a virtual image in optics is in general an image formed
    when the outgoing rays from a point on an object always diverge. With regard to
    display application, a virtual image can be interpreted according to a real viewing
    case. When an image is viewed, even though there is no physical display (monitor,
    TV, screen), in front of a person's eyes, it is called virtual image."
