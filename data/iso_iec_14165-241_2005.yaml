abstract:
- content: 'Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165 defines mappings for transporting Fibre Channel
    frames across the following types of backbone networks: ATM, SONET, and TCP&#x2F;IP.
    The backbone mappings support the attachment of Fibre Channel switches using the
    facilities of the underlying backbone network. Details regarding the mappings
    of Fibre Channel to ATM and SONET are completely specified in this FC-BB-2 standard.
    With respect to TCP&#x2F;IP, the FC-BB-2 and IETF Fibre Channel over TCP&#x2F;IP
    specifications together describe how Fibre Channel frames are transported over
    a TCP&#x2F;IP backbone.'
