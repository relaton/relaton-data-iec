abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008 prescribes methods for technology and scenario evaluations
    of multi-supplier biometric systems that use biometric data conforming to biometric
    data interchange format standards.  It specifies requirements needed to assess    performance
    available from samples formatted according to a standard interchange format (SIF),   performance
    available when samples formatted according to a SIF are exchanged,   performance
    available from samples formatted according to a SIF, relative to proprietary data
    formats,   SIF interoperability by quantifying cross-product performance relative
    to single-product performance,   performance available from multi-sample and multimodal
    data formatted according to one or more SIFs, and   performance interoperability
    of biometric capture devices.     In addition, ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008    includes
    procedures for establishing an interoperable set of implementations,   defines
    procedures for testing interoperability with previously established sets of implementations,
    and   gives testing procedures for the measurement of interoperable performance.     It
    does not    establish a conformance test for biometric data interchange formats,
    or   provide test procedures for online data collection.
