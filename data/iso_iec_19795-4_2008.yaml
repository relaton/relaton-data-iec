abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008 prescribes methods for technology and scenario
    evaluations of multi-supplier biometric systems that use biometric data conforming
    to biometric data interchange format standards.</p><p>It specifies requirements
    needed to assess</p><ul><li>performance available from samples formatted according
    to a standard interchange format (SIF),</li><li>performance available when samples
    formatted according to a SIF are exchanged,</li><li>performance available from
    samples formatted according to a SIF, relative to proprietary data formats,</li><li>SIF
    interoperability by quantifying cross-product performance relative to single-product
    performance,</li><li>performance available from multi-sample and multimodal data
    formatted according to one or more SIFs, and</li><li>performance interoperability
    of biometric capture devices.</li></ul><p>In addition, ISO/IEC 19795-4:2008</p><ul><li>includes
    procedures for establishing an interoperable set of implementations,</li><li>defines
    procedures for testing interoperability with previously established sets of implementations,
    and</li><li>gives testing procedures for the measurement of interoperable performance.</li></ul><p>It
    does not</p><ul><li>establish a conformance test for biometric data interchange
    formats, or</li><li>provide test procedures for online data collection.</li></ul>"
