abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62343-6-5:2011(E) explains an investigation of operating mechanical
    shock and a vibration test for dynamic modules. It also describes the results
    of a survey, evaluation and mechanical simulation of mechanical shock and vibration
    testing. This report covers a study of standardization for operating mechanical
    shock and vibration test methods.
