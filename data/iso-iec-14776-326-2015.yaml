  content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-326:2015(E) defines a Reduced Block Command set for
    logical block devices. The Reduced Block Commands along with the required SPC-2
    commands and their restrictions described in this standard, fully specify the
    complete command set for RBC logical block devices. It provides a command set
    of reduced requirements and options from SCSI Block Commands (SBC) (ISO&#x2F;IEC
    14776-321) for block devices. The reduced command set is intended to more closely
    match the functionality required for simple block logical units. The specified
    commands place no restrictions on device performance. The initial focus of this
    command set was to enable rigid disks and removable media devices attached to
    Serial Bus and utilizing SBP-2 (ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-232) for command and control.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2002 and
    constitutes a minor revision. This second edition provides additional explanations
    and corrects mistakes with respect to the first edition.
