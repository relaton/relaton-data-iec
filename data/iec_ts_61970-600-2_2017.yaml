abstract:
- content: "IEC 61970-600-2:2017(E) details the requirements of the exchange profiles
    belonging to the CGMES. The CGMES is defined using information on the Common Information
    Model (CIM) available in the public domain. The CGMES reflects TSO requirements
    for accurate modelling of the ENTSO-E area for power flow, short circuit and dynamics
    applications whilst also allowing for the exchange of any diagram layouts including
    GIS data of a grid model. Future editions of this technical specification will
    be released to describe following CGMES versions which reflect the additional
    requirements due to European network codes or guidelines.<br />\r\nKeyword: Smart
