  content: IEC 62746-10-1:2018 specifies a minimal data model and services for demand
    response (DR), pricing, and distributed energy resource (DER) communications.
    This document can be leveraged to manage customer energy resources, including
    load, generation, and storage, via signals provided by grid and/or market operators.
    These resources can be identified and managed as individual resources with specific
    capabilities, or as virtual resources with an aggregated set of capabilities.
    It specifies how to implement a two-way signaling system to facilitate information
    exchange between electricity service providers, aggregators, and end users. The
    DR signalling system is described in terms of servers (virtual top nodes or VTNs),
    which publish information to automated clients (virtual end nodes, or VENs), which
    in turn subscribe to the information. The services make no assumption of specific
    DR electric load control strategies that can be used within a DR resource or of
    any market-specific contractual or business agreements between electricity service
    providers and their customers.
