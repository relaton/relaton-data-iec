  content: "IEC 62977-3-5:2023 specifies standard evaluation methods for determining
    the colour capabilities of electronic display modules and systems with respect
    to colour accuracy, colour gamut volume, and their intersection with a reference
    colour space. Also included is evaluation with respect to the chromaticity gamut
    area. These methods apply to emissive and transmissive direct view displays that
    render real 2D images on a flat panel or on a curved panel with a local radius
    of curvature larger than 1 500 mm. This document evaluates the optical characteristics
    of these displays under darkroom conditions. This document applies to the testing
    of display performance in response to standard analogue or digital input signals
    that are not absolute luminance encoded. The input signal is relative RGB without
    metadata information that codes for real luminance, colour space or colour coordinates.
    These methods are limited to input signals with typical opto-electronic transfer
    functions (OETFs) such as defined in IEC 61966‑2‑1, Recommendation ITU-R BT.601
    [18]<a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>, Recommendation ITU-R BT.709, and Recommendation
    ITU-R BT.2020. The tests in this document are not suitable for use with HDR input
    signals.<br />\r\nThis document contains attached files in the form of Microsoft
    Excel spreadsheet and App installer. These files are intended to be used as a
    complement and do not form an integral part of the standard.<br />\r\nThe content
    of the corrigendum 1 (2024-10) has been included in this copy."
