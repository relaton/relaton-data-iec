abstract:
- content: "IEC 61496-3:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61496-3:2018
    specifies additional requirements for the design, construction and testing of
    electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed specifically to detect
    persons or parts of persons as part of a safety-related system, employing active
    opto-electronic protective devices responsive to diffuse reflection (AOPDDRs)
    for the sensing function. Special attention is directed to requirements which
    ensure that an appropriate safety-related performance is achieved. An ESPE can
    include optional safety-related functions, the requirements for which are given
    both in Annex A of this document and in Annex A of IEC 61496-1:2012. IEC 61496-3:2018
    not specify the dimensions or configurations of the detection zone and its disposition
    in relation to hazardous parts for any particular application, nor what constitutes
    a hazardous state of any machine. It is restricted to the functioning of the ESPE
    and how it interfaces with the machine. AOPDDRs are devices that have either<br
    />\r\n– one or more detection zone(s) specified in two dimensions (AOPDDR-2D),
    or<br />\r\n– one or more detection zone(s) specified in three dimensions (AOPDDR-3D)<br
    />\r\nwherein radiation in the near infrared range is emitted by an emitting element(s).
    When the emitted radiation impinges on an object (for example, a person or part
    of a person), a portion of the emitted radiation is reflected to a receiving element(s)
    by diffuse reflection. This reflection is used to determine the position of the
    object. Opto-electronic devices that perform only a single one-dimensional spot-like
    distance measurement, for example, optical proximity switches, are not covered
    by this document. IEC 61496-3:2018 does not address those aspects required for
    complex classification or differentiation of the object detected. IEC 61496-3:2018
    does not address requirements and tests for outdoor application. Excluded from
    IEC 61496-3:2018 are AOPDDRs employing radiation with the peak of wavelength outside
    the range 820 nm to 950 nm, and those employing radiation other than that generated
    by the AOPDDR itself. For sensing devices that employ radiation of wavelengths
    outside this range, this document can be used as a guide. IEC 61496-3:2018 is
    relevant for AOPDDRs having a minimum detectable object size in the range from
    30 mm to 200 mm. IEC 61496-3:2018 can be relevant to applications other than those
    for the protection of persons, for example, for the protection of machinery or
    products from mechanical damage. In those applications, different requirements
    can be appropiate, for example when the materials that have to be recognized by
    the sensing function have different properties from those of persons and their
    clothing. IEC 61496-3:2018 does not deal with electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
    emission requirements. IEC 61496-3:2018 cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision. IEC 61496-3:2018
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) extension of the scope from AOPDDR-2D to AOPDDR-3D;<br />\r\nb)
    extension of the scope from Type 3 ESPE to Type 2 ESPE;<br />\r\nc) implementation
    of requirements and test procedures for AOPDDR-3D and Type 2 ESPE;<br />\r\nd)
    listing of reference boundary monitoring as an optional function of the ESPE;<br
    />\r\ne) implementation of instructions for positioning of AOPDDR-3D in respect
    of parts of the human body;<br />\r\nf) revised requirement for combinations of
    single faults with conditions for no failure to danger, see for example 4.2.2.4,
    last paragraph.<br />\r\nIEC 61496-3:2018 is to be used in conjunction with IEC
    61496-1:2012."
