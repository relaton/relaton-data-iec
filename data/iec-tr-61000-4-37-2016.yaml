  content: IEC TR 61000-4-37:2016 outlines a typical test procedure for harmonic analysis
    in systems comprising tests apparatus designed to comply with IEC 61000-4-7, and
    products designed to comply with IEC 61000-3-2 and/or IEC 61000-3-12. The test
    procedure is intended to provide a systematic guidance suitable for use by manufacturers,
    end users, independent test laboratories and other bodies, for the purpose of
    determining the applicable compliance status within a wide range of harmonic current
    emissions. It is not intended as a replacement for type testing of harmonic analyzers,
    nor does it check all of the parameters specified in IEC 61000-4-7, IEC 61000-3-2,
    and IEC 61000-3-12. This publication contains attached files in the form of an
    xls document and a user guide. These files are intended to be used as a complement
    and do not form an integral part of the standard.
