abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24713-1:2008 provides common definitions used within the profile
    standards and references other standards applicable to the successful implementation
    of a generic biometric system. A harmonized (with the other part 1 standards in
    WG 3 and WG5) generic biometric system is described and a diagram is present.
    The description includes detail of the individual components present in a generic
    biometric system. ISO/IEC 24713-1:2008 furthermore describes the generic functions
    of the biometric system and the relationship between a biometric system and the
    application that uses that system. Lastly, ISO/IEC 24713-1:2008 details the possible
    interfaces into a biometric system as well as the relationship that exists between
    the various base standards currently under development within SC37.
