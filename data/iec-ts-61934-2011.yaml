  content: "IEC/TS 61934:2011(E) is applicable to the off-line electrical measurement
    of partial discharges (PD) that occur in electrical insulation systems (EIS) when
    stressed by repetitive voltage impulses generated from electronic power devices.
    Typical applications are EIS belonging to apparatus driven by power electronics,
    such as motors, inductive reactors and windmill generators. Excluded from the
    scope of this technical specification are:<br />\r\n- methods based on optical
    or ultrasonic PD detection,<br />\r\n- fields of application for PD measurements
    when stressed by non-repetitive impulse voltages such as lightning impulse or
    switching impulses from switchgear.<br />\r\nThe principal changes with regard
    to the previous edition concern the addition of:<br />\r\n- an Introduction that
    provides some background information on the progress being made in the field of
    power electronics;<br />\r\n- impulse generators;<br />\r\n- PD detection methods;<br
    />\r\n- a new informative Annex C covering practical experience obtained from
    round-robin testing (RRT);<br />\r\n- example of noise levels, as shown in new
    informative Annex D."
