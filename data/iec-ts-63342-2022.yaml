  content: "IEC TS 63342:2022 is designed to assess the effect of light induced degradation
    at elevated temperatures (LETID) by application of electrical current at higher
    temperatures. In this document, only the current injection approach for the detection
    of LETID is addressed.<br />\r\nThis document does not address the B-O and Iron
    Boron (Fe-B) related degradation phenomena, which already occur at room temperatures
    under the presence of light and on much faster time scales. The proposed test
    procedure can reveal sample sensitivity to LETID degradation mechanisms, but it
    does not provide an exact measure of field observable degradation."
