  content: The Residential Gateway (RG) is a device of the Home Electronic System
    (HES) that connects home network domains to network domains outside the house.
    It supports communications among devices within the premises, and among systems,
    service providers, operators and users outside the premises. The RG enables service
    and content providers to deliver services such as entertainment, video and broadband
    digital streams, monitoring for health care, security and occupancy, home appliance
    control and preventive maintenance, remote metering, and energy management. The
    RG specified by this standard does not imply the use of any particular protocol
    such as IP and it is recognised that many forms of the RG will exist using many
    types of data such as analogue video and broadband digital streams.
