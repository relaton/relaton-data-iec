  content: "IEC TS 62666:2016(E) provides guidelines to ensure consistency with respect
    to the specification of requirements for information, documentation and graphical
    symbols in IEC publications provided by system or product committees. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the references
    to relevant standards have been updated and horizontal standards have been designated;<br
    />\r\n- a new subclause \"Identification of equipment, basic and safety principles\"
    has been added. The reason for this is that a group of standards have been placed
    under the responsibility of TC 3."
