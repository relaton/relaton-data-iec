  content: "<p>Describes the function of the Interworking unit (IWU) in terms of the
    mapping between Protokol Data Units (PDUs) that it receives from one interface,
    and PDUs that it then transmits which could be on either interface of the IWU.
    Also describes procedures an IWU can initiate on each interface independently.
    Each interface corresponds to one instance of a DTE/DXE connection, and both interfaces
    of the Interworking Unit operate as a DTE as specified by ISO 8208. References:
    ISO 8208; 8880-2; 8881.</p>"
