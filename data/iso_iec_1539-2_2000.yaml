abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 1539 defines facilities in Fortran for the manipulation
    of character strings of dynamically variable length. This part of ISO/IEC 1539
    provides an auxiliary standard for the version of the Fortran language specified
    by ISO/IEC 1539-1: 1997 and informally known as Fortran 95.</p><p>A program that
    conforms with 1539-2: 1994 also conforms with this standard.</p><p>This part of
    ISO/IEC 1539 is an auxiliary standard to that defining Fortran 95 in that it defines
    additional facilities to those defined intrinsically in the primary language standard.
    A processor conforming to the Fortran 95 standard is not required also to conform
    to this part of ISO/IEC 1539. However, conformance to this part of ISO/IEC 1539
    assumes conformance to the primary Fortran 95 standard.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC
    1539 prescribes the name of a Fortran module, the name of a derived data type
    to be used to represent varying-length strings, the interfaces for the procedures
    and operators to be provided to manipulate objects of this type, and the semantics
    that are required for each of the entities made accessible by this module.</p><p>This
    part of ISO/IEC 1539 does not prescribe the details of any implementation. Neither
    the method used to represent the data entities of the defined type nor the algorithms
    used to implement the procedures or operators whose interfaces are defined by
    this part of ISO/IEC 1539 are prescribed. A conformant implementation may use
    any representation and any algorithms, subject only to the requirement that the
    publicly accessible names and interfaces conform to this part of ISO/IEC 1539,
    and that the semantics are as required by this part of ISO/IEC 1539 and those
    of ISO/IEC 1539-1: 1997.</p><p>It should be noted that a processor is not required
    to implement this part of ISO/IEC 1539 in order to be a standard conforming Fortran
    processor, but if a processor implements facilities for manipulating varying length
    character strings, it is recommended that this be done in a manner that is conformant
    with this part of ISO/IEC 1539.</p><p>A processor conforming to this part of ISO/IEC
    1539 may extend the facilities provided for the manipulation of varying length
    character strings as long as such extensions do not conflict with this part of
    ISO/IEC 1539 or with ISO/IEC 1539-1: 1997.</p><p>A module, written in standard
    conforming Fortran, is referenced in Annex A. This module illustrates one way
    in which the facilities described in this part of ISO/IEC 1539 could be provided.
    This module is both conformant with the requirements of this part of ISO/IEC 1539
    and, because it is written in standard conforming Fortran, it provides a portable
    implementation of the required facilities. This module is referenced for information
    only and is not intended to constrain implementations in any way. This module
    is a demonstration that at least one implementation, in standard conforming and
    hence portable Fortran, is possible.</p><p>It should be noted that this part of
    ISO/IEC 1539 defines facilities for dynamically varying length strings of characters
    of default kind only. Throughout this part of ISO/IEC 1539 all references to intrinsic
    type CHARACTER should be read as meaning characters of default kind. Similar facilities
    could be defined for non-default kind characters by a separate, if similar, module
    for each such character kind.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 1539 has been designed,
    as far as is reasonable, to provide for varying length character strings the facilities
    that are available for intrinsic fixed length character strings. All the intrinsic
    operations and functions that apply to fixed length character strings have extended
    meanings defined by this part of ISO/IEC 1539 for varying length character strings.
    Also a small number of additional facilities are defined that are appropriate
    because of the essential differences between the intrinsic type and the varying
    length derived data type.</p>"
