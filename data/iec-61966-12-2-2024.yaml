  content: "IEC 61966-12-2:2024 specifies the colour gamut metadata format for video
    systems intended for use in CE (consumer electronics) devices. The metadata specified
    in this part of IEC 61966-12 is limited to the gamut description for display types
    comprising the three primary additive colours, whose white and black points have
    the same chromaticity. It is fundamentally based on the conventional VESA-EDID
    format.<br />\r\nWhen associated with content, the simple metadata format defines
    the gamut for which the content was created. It can be used by the display for
    controlled colour reproduction even if the display’s colour gamut is different
    from that of the content. When associated with a display, the simple metadata
    format defines the display colour gamut. It can be used during content creation
    to enable improved colour reproduction.<br />\r\nThis document provides the simplest,
    but unambiguous solution for typical CE devices that are based on colour gamut
    information communication.<br />\r\nIEC 61966-12-2:2024 cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the number of bits of metadata format has
    been extended in Clause 4;<br />\r\nb) Annex C has been added for handling HDR
    content."
