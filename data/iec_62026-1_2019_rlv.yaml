abstract:
- content: "IEC 62026-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62026-1:2019
    applies to interfaces between low-voltage switchgear, controlgear, and controllers
    (e.g. programmable controllers, personal computers, etc.). This document does
    not apply to higher level industrial communication networks that have become known
    as fieldbuses and are considered by IEC subcommittee 65C. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) additional requirements
    for safety information and instructions, including the measures to be taken, if
    any, for achieving EMC compliance;<br />\r\nb) EMC immunity requirements aligned
    with current IEC 61000-6 series of standards. Radiated radio-frequency electromagnetic
    fields test level increased to 6 GHz;<br />\r\nc) EMC emissions requirements aligned
    with current CISPR 11 publication."
