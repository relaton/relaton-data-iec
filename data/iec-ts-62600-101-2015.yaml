  content: IEC TS 62600-101:2015(E) establishes a system for estimating, analysing
    and reporting the wave energy resource at sites potentially suitable for the installation
    of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). This Technical Specification is to be applied
    at all stages of site assessment from initial investigations to detailed project
    design. In conjunction with IEC TS 62600-100 (WEC performance) it enables an estimate
    of the annual energy production of a WEC or WEC array to be calculated.
