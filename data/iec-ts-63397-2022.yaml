  content: "IEC TS 63397:2022 defines additional testing requirements for modules
    deployed under applications or in environments where PV modules are likely to
    be exposed to the impact of hailstones leading to higher stress beyond the scope
    of the IEC 61215 series. This document aims to assist in the selection of modules
    for deployment in specific regions that have a higher risk of hail damage and
    to provide tools for improving module design.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of July 2023 have been included in this copy."
