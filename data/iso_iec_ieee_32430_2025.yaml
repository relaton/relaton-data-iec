abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines a method for measuring the
    non-functional size of the software. It complements ISO/IEC 20926:2009, which
    defines a method for measuring the functional size of the software.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document also describes the complementarity of functional and non-functional sizes,
    so that deriving the sizes from the functional and the non-functional requirements
    does not result in duplication in the distinct functional and non-functional sizes.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">In general, there are many types of non-functional requirements.
    Moreover, non-functional requirements and their classification evolve over time
    as the technology advances. This document does not intend to define the type of
    NFR for a given context. Users can choose ISO 25010 or any other standard for
    the definition of NFR. It is assumed that users size the NFR based on the definitions
    they use.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document covers a subset of non-functional
    requirements. It is expected that, with time, the state of the art can improve
    and that potential future versions of this document can define an extended coverage.
    The ultimate goal is a version that, together with ISO/IEC 20926:2009, covers
    every aspect that can be required of any prospective piece of software, including
    aspects such as process and project directives that are hard or impossible to
    trace to the software's algorithm or data. The combination of functional and non-functional
    sizes would then correspond to the total size necessary to bring the software
    into existence.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Estimating the cost, effort and duration
    of the implementation of the NFR is outside the scope of this document.</p>
