    <p>ISO/IEC 24770:2012 defines the test methods for determining the performance characteristics of 2,4 GHz real-time locating system (RTLS) equipment including tags, readers, and exciters which are applicable to the selection of equipment that conforms to ISO/IEC 24730-2 for specific applications. ISO/IEC 24770:2012 does not apply to the testing in relation to regulatory or similar requirements.</p>
    <p>The RTLS equipment performance parameters included in ISO/IEC 24770:2012 include the mandatory direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 2,4 GHz radio frequency beacon link between tags and readers. It includes the optional on-off keyed/frequency shift keyed (OOK/FSK) short range radio frequency link between tags and programmers. It also includes the optional magnetic air-interface between exciters and tags and between programmers and tags.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 24770:2012 apply exclusively to RTLS equipment defined in ISO/IEC 24730-2.</p>
