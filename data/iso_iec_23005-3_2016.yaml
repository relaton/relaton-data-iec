abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23005-3:2016 specifies syntax and semantics of description schemes
    and descriptors that represent sensory information. This international standard
    is applicable to enhance the experience of users while consuming media resources
    by stimulating human multi-sensor such as tactile, orfactory, light sense, temperature
    sense, etc.<p>The system architecture is depicted in Figure 1 and the scope of
    this Part of ISO/IEC 23005 is highlighted. That is, only the information representation
    that acts as an input to the possible Adaptation VR - as defined in ISO/IEC 23005-1
    - is specified in this Part of ISO/IEC 23005.</p><p>The adaptation engine for
    Sensory Information is to adapt Sensory information to Device Command which is
    the actual signal to control multi-sensory devices as defined in ISO/IEC 23005-5.
    This adaptation process is not mandatory incase the sensory information may directly
    control the actual devices.</p>
