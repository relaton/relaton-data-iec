abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 8441 specifies requirements for</p><p>unrecorded
    magnetic tape designed for high density</p><p>digital recording (HDDR) having
    the following</p><p>characteristics:</p><p>a) nominal thickness 25,4 urn (0,001
    in);</p><p>b) longitudinal magnetic orientation;</p><p>c) coercivity 72 kA/m (900
    Oe) max.</p><p>These tapes are suitable for interchange in accordance</p><p>with
    ISO/IEC 8441-2.</p><p>Requirements for packaging are also included.</p><p>NOTE
    1 Tapes of coercivity above 32 kA/m (400 Oe) are</p><p>usually classified as high
    energy tapes and users should</p><p>establish compatibility with equipment used
    for driving</p><p>them.</p><p>Annex A gives guidance on glass and metal-flanged</p><p>reels.
    Annex B gives information on the wear of recording</p><p>heads. Different categories
    of environmental</p><p>conditions and their effects on tape are dealt with in</p><p>annex
    C. Severe operating conditions are considered</p><p>in annex D. Surface electrical
    resistance</p><p>testing is dealt with in annex E. A tape abrasivity</p><p>testing
    technique is described in annex F. A list of</p><p>bibliographical references
    is given in annex G.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>2 It is recognized that archival interchange
    tapes, or</p><p>those produced by systems in use prior to the publication</p><p>of
    this part of ISO/lEC 8441, may not comply with the requirements</p><p>and/or recommendations
    herein.</p><p>3 Various tests and procedures herein refer to recording</p><p>with
    a.c. HF bias. In practice, certain HDDR systems do</p><p>not use bias. The use
    of bias in this part of ISO/IEC 8441</p><p>does not imply that the tape so tested
    is in any way unsuitable</p><p>for a biasless system.</p>"
