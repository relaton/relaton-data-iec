abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between
    integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic services
    for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to
    ISO/IEC 7816-4.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 specifies<br />\r\nsystem
    architecture and principles of operation,<br />\r\na capabilities discovery mechanism,<br
    />\r\nsecurity rationale.<br /><br />\r\nIt does not cover the internal implementation
    within the card or the outside world.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 is independent
    of the physical interface technology. It applies to cards accessed by one or more
    of the following methods: contacts, close coupling and radio frequency."
