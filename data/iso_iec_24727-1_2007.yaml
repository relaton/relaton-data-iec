abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between
    integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic services
    for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to
    ISO/IEC 7816-4.   ISO/IEC 24727-1:2007 specifies    system architecture and principles
    of operation,  a capabilities discovery mechanism,  security rationale.     It
    does not cover the internal implementation within the card or the outside world.   ISO/IEC
    24727-1:2007 is independent of the physical interface technology. It applies to
    cards accessed by one or more of the following methods: contacts, close coupling
    and radio frequency.'
