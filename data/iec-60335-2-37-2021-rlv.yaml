  content: "IEC 60335-2-37:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-37:2021
    deals with the safety of electrically operated commercial deep fat fryers and
    doughnut fryers including pressurized types with a pressure not exceeding 50 kPa
    and a pressure volume litres product not exceeding 200, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase and
    neutral and 480 V for other appliances. These appliances are not intended for
    household and similar purposes. They are used for commercial processing of food
    in areas not open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens,
    hospitals and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries. The electrical
    part of appliances making use of other forms of energy is also within the scope
    of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common
    hazards presented by these types of appliances. Attention is drawn to the fact
    that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships
    or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified for pressure appliances.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- appliances for continuous mass production of food;<br />\r\n- battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition
    published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text or modified (Clause
    1, 7.15, 15.102, 19.1, 22.101, 22.104, 22.105, 22.110, 27.2, 30.101);<br />\r\nc)
    conciliation of the text of IEC 60335-2-37 with other standards under IEC/TC61/MT32;<br
    />\r\nd) exclusion of battery-operated appliances and appliances used in areas
    open to the public (Clause 1);<br />\r\ne) clarification of the testing procedure
    in 15.1.1;<br />\r\nf) relocation of cleaning instructions from 7.12.1 to 7.12;<br
    />\r\ng) relocation of 24.101 to 22.121;<br />\r\nh) clarification on the test
    conditions in 19.1 and 23.3;<br />\r\ni) clarifications in the requirements in
    25.3.<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
