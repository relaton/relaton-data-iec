abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 6114:2023 This document describes security considerations throughout
    the product life cycle (SCLC), which is a framework that spans the entire information
    and communications technology (ICT) product life cycle. The aim of the framework
    is to align the industry and bring greater transparency to customers at every
    point on the ICT product life cycle.<br />\r\nThis document describes the following
    items for suppliers, end users (consumers), intermediaries of the ICT supply chain,
    service providers, and regulators:<br />\r\n- definition of phases in the ICT
    product life cycle from concept to retirement;<br />\r\n- threat vectors possible
    in each phase of the life cycle;<br />\r\n- potential controls against those threat
    vectors.<br />\r\nThe target audiences of this document are suppliers and consumers
    of ICT products, including all participants throughout the supply chain such as
    silicon chip designers, fabricators, product assemblers, logistics providers,
    service providers, and information security organizations. Clauses 5 to 11 target
    an organizationâ€™s strategic and risk management teams. This document provides
    an end-to-end view of the threats in each phase to help the organization shape
    their plans, procedures and policies."
