abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 is a reissue of the 1995 version of the<em>Guide
    to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM)</em>, with minor corrections.
    This Guide establishes general rules for evaluating and expressing uncertainty
    in measurement that can be followed at various levels of accuracy and in many
    fields - from the shop floor to fundamental research. The principles of this Guide
    are intended to be applicable to a broad spectrum of measurements, including those
    required for:<br />\r\n- maintaining quality control and quality assurance in
    production;<br />\r\n- complying with and enforcing laws and regulations;<br />\r\n-
    conducting basic research, and applied research and development, in science and
    engineering;<br />\r\n- calibrating standards and instruments and performing tests
    throughout a national measurement system in order to achieve traceability to national
    standards;<br />\r\n- developing, maintaining, and comparing international and
    national physical reference standards, including reference materials.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe HTML version of JCGM 100:2008, on which ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 is based,
    is available by clicking  here."
