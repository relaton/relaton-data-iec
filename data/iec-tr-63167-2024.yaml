  content: IEC TR 63167:2024 provides general information on the assessment of contact
    current related to human exposure to electric, magnetic and electromagnetic fields.
    The contact currents in this context occur when a human body comes into contact
    with a conductive object that is non-electrified but exposed to an electric field
    or magnetic field or both at a different electric potential owing to electric
    or magnetic induction to the object. This is distinguished from the issue of electrical
    safety where contact with live parts of a conductive object is dealt with. In
    reference to the international EMF guidelines, the frequency range of contact
    current covered in this document is DC to 110 MHz, and only steady-state (continuous)
    contact currents are covered. Transient contact currents (spark discharges) which
    can occur immediately before the contact with the object are not covered.
