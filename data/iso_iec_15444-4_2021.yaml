abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    Recommendation International Standard specifies the framework, concepts, methodology
    for testing, and criteria to be achieved to claim compliance to Rec. ITU-T T.800
    ISO/IEC 15444-1 or Rec. ITU-T T.814 ISO/IEC 15444-15. It provides a framework
    for specifying abstract test suites (ATSs) and for defining the procedures to
    be followed during compliance testing.<br />\r\nThis Recommendation International
    Standard:<br />\r\n‒ specifies compliance testing procedures for encoding and
    decoding using Rec. ITU-T T.800 ISO/IEC 15444-1 and Rec. ITU-T T.814 ISO/IEC 15444-15;<br
    />\r\n‒ specifies codestreams, decoded images, and error metrics to be used with
    the testing procedures;<br />\r\n‒ specifies ATSs;<br />\r\n‒ provides guidance
    for creating an encoder compliance test<br />\r\nThis Recommendation International
    Standard does not include the following tests:<br />\r\n- Acceptance testing:
    the process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance criteria
    and enables the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation.
    This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g., functionality,
    quality, and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation
    satisfies the user requirements.<br />\r\n- Performance testing: measures the
    performance characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT) such as its
    throughput and responsiveness, under various conditions.<br />\r\n- Robustness
    testing: the process of determining how well an implementation processes data
    which contains errors."
