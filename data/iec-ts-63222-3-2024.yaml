  content: "IEC TS 63222-3:2024 is intended to provide provisions regarding recognized
    engineering practices applicable to assess the user’s characteristics in power
    quality predicted assessment. It summarizes the best practice in non-linear, unbalanced,
    impact and fluctuating loads or generations modelling for power quality disturbance
    anticipation in public power systems at the planning stage.<br />\r\nThis document
    focuses on frequency-domain modelling for AC power quality analysis in electric
    power networks, typically in the range up to the 50th harmonic (2,5 kHz in 50
    Hz systems or 3 kHz in 60 Hz systems). Unbalance is analyzed in three-phase systems
    and only negative sequence component is considered. The approach and modelling
    guidelines provided are valid on the representation of user installations connected
    to power systems acting as sources of disturbance. Modelling of the network elements
    is out of the scope of the document.<br />\r\nThese guidelines will be valuable
    in the definition of power quality performance specifications for user equipment.
    They will also assist users when modelling their installation to assess or demonstrate
    compliance with the emission limits provided by the system owner/operator and
    to investigate and specify mitigation measures."
