abstract:
- content: "<p>Specifies a protocol to be used by boundary intermediate systems to
    acquire and maintain information for the purpose of routeing NPDUs between different
    routeing domains. Lays down the procedures for the exchange of inter-domain reachability
    and path information between BISs, the procedures for maintaining inter-domain
    routeing information bases within a BIS, the encoding of protocol data units used
    to distribute inter-domain routeing information between BISs, the functional requirements
    for implementations that claim conformance to this standard. The protocol described
    operates at the level of individual routeing domains. Does not cover the establishment
    of administrative domains.</p>"
