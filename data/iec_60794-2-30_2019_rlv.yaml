    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and

    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60794-2-30:2019
    is a family specification which covers indoor optical fibre ribbon cables for
    use in terminated cable assemblies. The requirements of the sectional specification
    IEC 60794-2 are applicable to cables covered by this document. The requirements
    of this document are written to define flat ribbon cables. This document can be
    applicable to other cable constructions. Parts of IEC 60794-3 which are applicable
    for ribbon tests are the subject of IEC 60794-1-31. Annex B contains requirements
    that supersede the normal requirements in case the cables are intended to be used
    in installation governed by the MICE table of ISO 11801-3.This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) removal of Annex C;<br />\r\nb)
    reference to the most recent fibre standards;<br />\r\nc) reference to IEC 60794-1-21,
    IEC 60794-1-22, IEC 60794-1-23 and IEC 60794-1-24.<br />\r\nThis standard is to
    be used in conjunction with IEC 60794-1-1, IEC 60794-1-2 and<br />\r\nIEC 60794-2.<br
