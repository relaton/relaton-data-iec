  content: "IEC/TR 62362: 2020 which is a technical report, provides information on
    the specification of optical fibre cables with respect to the mechanical, ingress,
    climatic and chemical or electromagnetic characteristics (MICE) as classified
    in ISO/IEC 11801-1. In this classification system, each letter of the four initials
    of the acronym are subscripted with a value from one to three to indicate different
    severities. The current attributes and severities are found in Annex A. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010. It constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- replacement of references
    and information from ISO/IEC 24702 and ISO/IEC 11801 with ISO/IEC 11801-1;<br
    />\r\n- update of the MICE table;<br />\r\n- update of the current optical fibre
    designations of IEC 60793-2-10 and IEC 60793-2-50."
