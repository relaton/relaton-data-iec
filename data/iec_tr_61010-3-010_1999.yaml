- content: 'A technical report for use by test houses and other users. It assists
    them with determining and recording verification of conformity of the equipment
    under test with the requirements of IEC 61010-2-010 (1992) plus Amendment 1 (1996).
    If the paper version of the report is ordered, a diskette is provided with fill-in
    tables for recording the test results. If the report is downloaded directly from
    the web, it consists of two files: the technical report as a ZIP file and the
    fill-in tables as a WORD file.'
