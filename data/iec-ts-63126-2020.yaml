  content: "IEC TS 63126:2020 defines additional testing requirements for modules
    deployed under conditions leading to higher module temperature which are beyond
    the scope of IEC 61215-1 and IEC 61730-1 and the relevant component standards,
    IEC 62790 and IEC 62852. The testing conditions specified in IEC 61215-2 and IEC
    61730-2 (and the relevant component standards IEC 62790 and IEC 62852) assumed
    that these standards are applicable for module deployment where the 98th percentile
    temperature (<em>T</em>98th), that is the temperature that a module would be expected
    to equal or exceed for 175,2 h per year, is less than 70 °C. This document defines
    two temperature regimes, temperature level 1 and temperature level 2, which were
    designed considering deployment in environments with mounting configurations such
    that the <em>T</em>98th is less than or equal to 80 °C for temperature level 1,
    and less than or equal to 90 °C for temperature level 2.<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum 1 (2022-09) have been included in this copy."
