abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61851-26:2026, in combination with IEC 61851-1 or IEC 61851-23,
    gives the requirements for EV supply equipment with automatic docking and undocking
    functions (aEVSE) at the underbody of electrically propelled road vehicles according
    to ISO TS 5474-5.<br />\r\nUse of aEVSE with the megawatt charging system is under
    consideration.<br />\r\nThis document provides requirements for aEVSE with a single
    vehicle connector or a single socket-outlet.<br />\r\nRequirements for aEVSE with
    more than one vehicle connector or more than one socket-outlet are under consideration.<br
    />\r\nThis document only applies to automatic couplers of category 3, located
    at the underbody of an electric vehicle.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply
    to automatic coupler of category 1: using a vehicle coupler defined by IEC 62196-2,
    IEC 62196-3 or IEC TS 62196-3-1.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to automatic
    couplers of category 2: using an electro-mechanical interface defined by EN 50696.
    EN 50696 also specifies automatic couplers located at the underbody of an electric
    vehicle. However, these couplers only provide DC power transfer.<br />\r\nInteroperable
    communication for docking and undocking between an aEVSE and an EV, extending
    the communication between an EV supply equipment and an EV as specified in IEC
    61851-1, IEC 61851-23, IEC 61851-24 and the ISO 15118 series, is under consideration.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not cover all safety aspects related to maintenance."
