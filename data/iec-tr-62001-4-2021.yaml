  content: "IEC TR 62001:2021, which is a Technical Report, provides guidance on the
    basic data of AC side filters for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and
    their components such as ratings, power losses, design issues and special applications,
    protection, seismic requirements, equipment design and test parameters.<br />\r\nThis
    document covers AC side filtering for the frequency range of interest in terms
    of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances. It excludes filters
    designed to be effective in the power line carrier (PLC) and radio interference
    spectra. It concerns the conventional AC filter technology and LCC (line-commutated
    converter) HVDC but much of this applies to any filter equipment for VSC (voltage
    sourced converter) HVDC. This edition includes the following significant technical
    change with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- general updating of the
    document to reflect changes in practice;<br />\r\n- Annex A deleted as its content
    is covered by IEC 61803."
