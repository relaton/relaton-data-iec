abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be  downloaded
    \ from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 18180:2013 specifies the data model and Extensible Markup Language
    (XML) representation for the Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format
    (XCCDF) Version 1.2. An XCCDF document is a structured collection of security
    configuration rules for some set of target systems. The XCCDF specification is
    designed to support information interchange, document generation, organizational
    and situational tailoring, automated compliance testing, and scoring. ISO/IEC
    18180:2013 also defines a data model and format for storing results of security
    guidance or checklist testing. The intent of XCCDF is to provide a uniform foundation
    for expression of security checklists and other configuration guidance, and thereby
    foster more widespread application of good security practices."
