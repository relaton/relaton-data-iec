abstract:
- content: "The world is rapidly transitioning to a clean energy future, with renewables
    expected to contribute to nearly 50% of the global electricity mix by 2030. A
    key driver for clean energy and net-zero goals is photovoltaic (PV) technology,
    which allows harvesting solar energy for our electricity needs.<br /><br />\r\nAccording
    to a study cited in the report, the global installed capacity of PV systems has
    grown from 1.2 TW in 2022 to 1.6 TW in 2023. Emerging PV technologies are set
    to further revolutionize the new energy sector by reducing costs, improving efficiency,
    and expanding applications.<br /><br />\r\nAmidst rapid development in the photovoltaic
    industry, this societal and technology trend report serves as a systematic summary
    of the history, status, and key technologies of emerging photovoltaics.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe report examines emerging PV technologies like perovskite, organic, and
    quantum-dot PV materials, with a primary focus on perovskites, one of the fastest-developing
    and most promising technologies. It evaluates real-world application scenarios,
    highlights key challenges including in performance and manufacturing, and aims
    to aid the IEC and partners in understanding and supporting these technologies.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology trend report was developed by the
    Societal and Technology Trend Working Group (STTWG) in the IEC Market Strategy
    Board (MSB), and is available for free download."
