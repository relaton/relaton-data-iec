  content: "IEC 63510-1:2025 defines data models for Interoperable Connected Household
    Appliances. The data models are derived from a logical decomposition of use cases
    into functional blocks that themselves were realized by abstract actions on the
    data model itself.<br />\r\nThis document is part of the IEC 63510 series, which
    defines the information exchange between Smart Appliances and management systems
    in homes and buildings including energy management."
