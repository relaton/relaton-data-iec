  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-111:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-111:2024 RLV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-111:2024 deals with the safety of electric ondol-mattresses
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.
    This standard also applies to control units supplied with the appliance.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use, but that nevertheless can be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used in community spas
    or by persons in cold ambient temperatures, are within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n-
    appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- blankets, pads and similar flexible heating appliances (IEC 60335-2-17);<br
    />\r\n- room heaters (IEC 60335-2-30);<br />\r\n- water bed heaters (IEC 60335-2-66);<br
    />\r\n- heating appliances for breeding and rearing animals (IEC 60335-2-71);<br
    />\r\n- foot warmers and heating mats (IEC 60335-2-81);<br />\r\n- flexible sheet
    heating elements for room heating (IEC 60335-2-96);<br />\r\n- heated carpets
    and heating units for room heating installed under removable floor coverings (IEC
    60335 2 106);<br />\r\n- appliances specifically intended for use under medical
    supervision (IEC 80601-2-35).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) application
    of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
