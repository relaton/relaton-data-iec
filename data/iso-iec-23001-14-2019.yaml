  content: "<p>This document specifies the partial file format, which is a generic
    format for describing file partially received over lossy communication channels.
    This format contains the correctly received data, missing block identification,
    and repair information such as location of the file or high-level original indexing
    information. This format can be used with any file formats, and provides additional
    helper tools for formats deriving from ISO/IEC 14496-12.</p>"
