abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23000-7:2008 specifies a container format, which can contain any
    type of content and can also transport additional metadata. This packaging mechanism
    offers the possibility to enrich the content with human and machine-readable metadata
    and is not limited to a specific content type. Unlike other Application Formats,
    The Open Access Application Format is not a multimedia-based format.
