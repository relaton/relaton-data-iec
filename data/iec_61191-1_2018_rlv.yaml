abstract:
- content: "IEC 61191-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61191-1:2018
    prescribes requirements for materials, methods and verification criteria for producing
    quality soldered interconnections and assemblies using surface mount and related
    assembly technologies. This part of IEC 61191 also includes recommendations for
    good manufacturing processes. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the requirements
    have been updated to be compliant with the acceptance criteria in IPCâ€‘A-610F;<br
    />\r\n- the term \"assembly drawing\" has been changed to \"assembly documentation\"
    throughout;<br />\r\n- references to IEC standards have been corrected;<br />\r\n-
    Clause 9 was completely rewritten;<br />\r\n- Annex B was removed because there
    are already procedures for circuit board assemblies."
