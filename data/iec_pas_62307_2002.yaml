abstract:
- content: Details the procedures for the measurement of characteristic bulk material
    properties of moisture diffusivity and water solubility in organic materials used
    in the packaging of IC components. These two material properties are important
    parameters for the effective reliability performance of plastic packaged ICs after
    exposure to moisture and subjected to high temperature solder reflow.
