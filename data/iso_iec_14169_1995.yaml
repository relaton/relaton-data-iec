abstract:
- content: Specifies the mechanical, physical and magnetical characteristics of the
    cartridge, so as to provide physical interchangeability between data processing
    systems. It also specifies the method of recording, the quality of recorded signals,
    the track layouts and the track formats. Such flexible disk cartridges are identified
    as ISO type 305. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, for instance
    ISO/IEC 9293, it allows full data interchange between data processing systems.
