abstract:
- content: "This document defines the test methods for determining the performance
    characteristics of chirp spread spectrum (CSS) real time locating system (RTLS)
    equipment including tags and readers which are applicable to the selection of
    equipment that conforms to ISO/IEC 24730‑5 for specific applications. This document
    does not apply to the testing in relation to regulatory or similar requirements.<br
    />\r\nThe RTLS equipment performance parameters included in this document only
    include the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) radio frequencies link between tags and
    readers. Unlike ISO/IEC 18305, the tests in this document apply exclusively to
    RTLS equipment defined in ISO/IEC 24730‑5 unless specified otherwise."
