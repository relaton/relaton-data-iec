abstract:
- content: "IEC 62722-1:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62722-1:2022
    covers specific performance and environmental requirements for luminaires, incorporating
    electric light sources for operation from supply voltages up to 1 000 V. Unless
    otherwise detailed, performance data covered under the scope of this document
    are for the luminaires in a condition representative of new manufacture, with
    any specified initial aging procedures completed. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The reference to and use of the measurement
    methods for non-active power consumption in accordance with IEC 63103 have been
    added.<br />\r\n- The pictograms of Annex C have been updated to represent modern
    light sources."
