abstract:
- content: 'This part of ISO/IEC 13888:2004 serves as a general model for subsequent
    parts specifying non-repudiation mechanisms using cryptographic techniques. The
    goal of the non-repudiation service is to generate, collect, maintain, make available
    and verify evidence concerning a claimed event or action in order to resolve disputes
    about the occurrence or non-occurrence of the event or action. There are two main
    types of evidence, the nature of which depends on cryptographic techniques employed:
    the secure envelopes generated by an evidence-generating authority using symmetric
    cryptographic techniques, and digital signatures generated by an evidence generator
    or an evidence generating authority using asymmetric cryptographic techniques.Non-repudiation
    mechanisms generic to the various non-repudiation services are described first.
    The different parts of this International Standard provide non-repudiation mechanisms
    for the following phases of non-repudiation: evidence generation, transfer, storage,
    retrieval and verification. The non-repudiation mechanisms are then applied to
    a selection of specific non-repudiation services such as non-repudiation of origin,
    non-repudiation of delivery, non-repudiation of submission, and non-repudiation
    of transport. Non-repudiation mechanisms provide protocols for the exchange of
    non-repudiation tokens specific to each non-repudiation service. Non-repudiation
    tokens consist of secure envelopes and/or digital signatures and, optionally,
    of additional data.'
