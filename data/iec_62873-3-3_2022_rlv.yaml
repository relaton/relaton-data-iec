abstract:
- content: "IEC 62873-3-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62873-3-3:2022
    applies to devices equipped with screw-type terminals of copper - or of alloys
    containing at least 58 % of copper (if worked cold) or at least 50 % of copper
    (if worked otherwise), or of other metal or suitably coated metal, no less resistant
    to corrosion than copper and having mechanical properties no less suitable â€“ for
    use with untreated aluminium conductors, or with screw-type terminals of aluminium
    material for use with copper or aluminium conductors. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Modification of scope to address other
    devices in addition to RCDs;<br />\r\n- Modification of Clause 8 so that IEC 62873-3-3
    can be referred to by other product standards in addition to those for RCDs;<br
    />\r\n- Modification of 9.1 so that IEC 62873-3-3 can be referred to by other
    product standards in addition to those for RCDs."
