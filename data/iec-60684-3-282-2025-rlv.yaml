  content: "IEC 60684-3-282:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-282:2025
    gives the requirements for two types of heat-shrinkable, polyolefin sleeving,
    stress control, not flame retarded, with a nominal shrink ratio up to 3:1.<br
    />\r\nThis sleeving has been found suitable for use up to temperatures of 100
    °C.<br />\r\nType A: Medium wall Internal diameter up to 65,0 mm typically<br
    />\r\nType B: Thick wall Internal diameter up to 95,0 mm typically<br />\r\nSince
    these types of sleevings cover a significantly large range of sizes and wall thicknesses,
    Annex A provides guidance to the range of sizes available. The actual size will
    be agreed between the user and the supplier."
