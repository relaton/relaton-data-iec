  content: "IEC TS 61496-5:2023 provides particular requirements for the design, construction
    and testing of non-contact electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) designed
    specifically to provide whole-body detection of a person or persons as part of
    a safety-related system, employing radar protective devices (RPDs) responsive
    to diffuse reflection of radar signals for the sensing function using frequency-modulated
    continuous-wave (FMCW) technique. Special attention is directed to features which
    ensure that an appropriate safety-related performance is achieved. An ESPE can
    include optional safety-related functions, the requirements for which are given
    in Annex A of IEC 61496-1:2020 and Annex A of this document.<br />\r\nThe requirements
    given in this document are related to the detection of adult persons being present
    in an industrial manufacturing environment.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify
    the dimensions or configurations of the detection zone and its disposition in
    relation to hazardous parts for any particular application, nor what constitutes
    a hazardous state of any machine. It is restricted to the functioning of the ESPE
    and how it interfaces with the machine.<br />\r\nThis document does not consider
    the aspects of a moving RPD application. Additional consideration can be necessary,
    if the RPD supplier specifies the RPD for use on moving application.<br />\r\nAdditional
    requirements and tests can apply if setup of the RPD differs from Figure 2 and
    Figure 4.<br />\r\nWhere this document does not contain all necessary provisions,
    IEC TS 62998-1 is used.<br />\r\nFor those aspects not considered in this document
    it is also possible to additionally use provisions from IEC TS 62998-1.<br />\r\nExcluded
    from this document are RPDs that employ electromagnetic radiation outside the
    range 9 GHz to 81 GHz (identified as subset of band 10 and band 11 in accordance
    with ITU Radio Regulations). For sensing devices that employ electromagnetic radiation
    outside this range, this document can be used as a guide. National regulations
    can limit the available frequencies.<br />\r\nThis document can be relevant to
    applications other than those for the protection of persons, for example for the
    protection of machinery or products from mechanical damage. In those applications,
    different requirements can be appropriate, for example when the materials to be
    recognized by the sensing function have different properties from those of persons.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not deal with requirements for ESPE functions not related
    to the protection of persons (e.g. using sensing unit data for navigation).<br
    />\r\nWhile a data interface can be used to control optional safety-related ESPE
    functions (Annex A), this document does not provide specific requirements. Requirements
    for these safety-related functions can be determined by consulting other standards
    (for example, IEC 61508, IEC 62046, IEC 62061, and ISO 13849-1).<br />\r\nThis
    document does not deal with EMC emission requirements.<br />\r\nThe contents of
    the corrigendum of October 2023 have been included in this copy."
