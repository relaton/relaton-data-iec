abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-2-43:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-43:
    2022 aims at screening single-mode physical contact (PC) optical fibre connector
    plugs of an optical fibre patch cord or an optical fibre pigtail in terms of return
    loss, thus ensuring minimum return loss when the connector plugs are randomly
    mated with each other in the field. This document is intended to apply to cylindrical
    ferrule connector plugs. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical change with respect to the previous
    edition: addition of Clause 3 containing terms, definitions, and abbreviated terms."
