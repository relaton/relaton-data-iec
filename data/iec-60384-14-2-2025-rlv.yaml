  content: "IEC 60384-14-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60384-14-2:2025
    forms the basis for a uniform procedure for a common international safety mark.
    It implements the approval schedule for safety tests in IEC 60384‑14, specifies
    a declaration of design for parameters relevant to safety and indicates conformance
    tests to be conducted on every lot prior to its release and requalification tests
    depending on changes to the declared design.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the tables for dimensions have been replaced with a guidance text in
    the document,<br />\r\nb) the possibility to give the requirements for the service
    in DC applications and in high humidity conditions have been added.<br />\r\nc)
    the changes in this document in comparison with the previous edition are given
    in Annex B.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 60384‑1:2021 and IEC 60384‑14:2023."
