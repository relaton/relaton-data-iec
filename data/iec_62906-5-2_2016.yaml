abstract:
- content: "IEC 62906-5-2:2016(E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measurement methods for determining the monochromatic speckle contrast of laser
    display devices (LDDs). The LDDs may include hybrid types using both a laser or
    lasers, and spontaneous emission-based light sources, such as LEDs.<br />\r\nNOTE:
    The monochromatic speckle contrast measurements do not include image quality issues."
