    <p>This document specifies a method for measuring the digital copying productivity of digital copying devices and multifunctional devices with various copying modes. It is applicable to digital copying devices and multifunctional devices equipped with automatic document feeder (ADF) and collating function. This document is intended to be used for black and white (B&amp;W) as well as colour digital copying devices and multifunctional devices of any underlying marking technology. It allows comparison of the throughput copying rates for a machine operated in various available operating modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, 2-up, etc.) and various available digital image processing configurations. This document includes test files, test setup procedures, test procedures, and reporting requirements for digital copying productivity measurements.</p>
    <p>This document is not intended to be used for devices which are not able to copy on a media size of A4/8,5” × 11”, devices that do not have an ADF, or devices which are not able to collate multiple copies of original prints from a test set.</p>
    <p>This document is not intended to replace manufacturer's rated speeds.</p>
