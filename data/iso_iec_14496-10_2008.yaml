abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 was developed jointly with the ITU-T in response
    to the growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications
    such as digital storage media, television broadcasting, Internet streaming, and
    real-time audiovisual communication. It is also designed to enable the use of
    the coded video representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network
    environments. It is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide
    range of applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services. The use
    of ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 allows motion video to be manipulated as a form of computer
    data and to be stored on various storage media, transmitted and received over
    existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future broadcasting
    channels. In the course of creating ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008, requirements from a
    wide variety of applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements
    have been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence,
    ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 will facilitate video data interchange among different applications.</p><p>The
    coded representation specified in the syntax is designed to enable a high compression
    capability with minimal degradation of image quality. The algorithm is not ordinarily
    lossless, as the exact source sample values are typically not preserved through
    the encoding and decoding processes. A number of syntactical features with associated
    decoding processes are defined that can be used to achieve highly efficient compression,
    and individual selected regions can be sent without loss. The expected encoding
    algorithm (not specified in ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008) can select between<em>inter</em>
    and<em>intra</em> coding for block-shaped regions of each picture. Inter coding
    uses motion vectors for block-based inter-picture prediction to exploit temporal
    statistical dependencies between different pictures. Intra coding uses spatial
    prediction modes to exploit spatial statistical dependencies in the source signal
    within a single picture. Motion vectors and intra prediction modes may be associated
    with a variety of block sizes in a picture. The residual signal remaining after
    intra or inter prediction is then processed using a spatial transform to remove
    spatial correlation within each transform block. The transformed blocks are then
    quantised. Quantisation is an irreversible process that forms an approximation
    that can be represented using a reduced number of bits while incurring some loss
    of fidelity. Finally, the motion vectors or intra prediction modes are combined
    with the quantised transform coefficient information and encoded using either
    context-adaptive variable length codes or context-adaptive binary arithmetic coding.</p><p>Annexes
    A through E and G contain normative requirements and are an integral part of ISO/IEC
    14496-10:2008. Annex A defines eleven<em>profiles</em> (Baseline, Main, Extended,
    High, High 10, High 4:2:2, High 4:4:4 Predictive, High 10 Intra, High 4:2:2 Intra,
    High 4:4:4 Intra, and CAVLC 4:4:4 Intra), each being tailored to a group of application
    domains, and also defines<em>levels</em> of capability within each of these profiles.
    Annex B specifies the syntax and semantics of a byte stream format for delivery
    of the coded video as an ordered stream of bytes or bits. Annex C specifies the
    Hypothetical Reference Decoder and its use to check bitstream and decoder conformance.
    Annex D specifies syntax and semantics for Supplemental Enhancement Information
    message payloads. Annex E specifies syntax and semantics of the Video Usability
    Information parameters of coded video sequences. Annex G specifies scalable video
    coding in three additional profiles (Scalable Baseline, Scalable High, and Scalable
    High Intra) which enable a coded video bitstream to be structured into layers,
    such that layered subsets of the bitstream can be independently decodable to provide
    video quality commensurate with the quantity of data that remains in each smaller
    bitstream.</p><p>ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 is the fourth edition of the ISO/IEC 14496-10
    specification. It includes the same technical material specified in the first
    edition (ISO/IEC 14496-10:2003), plus the following:</p><p>– integrated errata
    corrections that were specified in corrigenda of 2004, 2005, and 2006.</p><p>–
    enhancements primarily for high-resolution, high-quality video applications that
    were specified in a 2004 amendment referred to as "Fidelity Range Extensions"
    and a 2007 amendment referred to as "Professional Application Extensions".</p><p>–
    enhancements supporting additional color spaces and aspect ratio definitions specified
    in a 2007 amendment.</p><p>enhancements supporting scalable video coding as specified
    in a 2007 amendment.</p>
