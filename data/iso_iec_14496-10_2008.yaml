abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 was developed jointly with the ITU-T in response
    to the growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications
    such as digital storage media, television broadcasting, Internet streaming, and
    real-time audiovisual communication. It is also designed to enable the use of
    the coded video representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network
    environments. It is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide
    range of applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services. The use
    of ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 allows motion video to be manipulated as a form of computer
    data and to be stored on various storage media, transmitted and received over
    existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future broadcasting
    channels. In the course of creating ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008, requirements from a
    wide variety of applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements
    have been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence,
    ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 will facilitate video data interchange among different applications.<br
    /><br /><br />\r\nThe coded representation specified in the syntax is designed
    to enable a high compression capability with minimal degradation of image quality.
    The algorithm is not ordinarily lossless, as the exact source sample values are
    typically not preserved through the encoding and decoding processes. A number
    of syntactical features with associated decoding processes are defined that can
    be used to achieve highly efficient compression, and individual selected regions
    can be sent without loss. The expected encoding algorithm (not specified in ISO/IEC
    14496-10:2008) can select between inter and intra coding for block-shaped regions
    of each picture. Inter coding uses motion vectors for block-based inter-picture
    prediction to exploit temporal statistical dependencies between different pictures.
    Intra coding uses spatial prediction modes to exploit spatial statistical dependencies
    in the source signal within a single picture. Motion vectors and intra prediction
    modes may be associated with a variety of block sizes in a picture. The residual
    signal remaining after intra or inter prediction is then processed using a spatial
    transform to remove spatial correlation within each transform block. The transformed
    blocks are then quantised. Quantisation is an irreversible process that forms
    an approximation that can be represented using a reduced number of bits while
    incurring some loss of fidelity. Finally, the motion vectors or intra prediction
    modes are combined with the quantised transform coefficient information and encoded
    using either context-adaptive variable length codes or context-adaptive binary
    arithmetic coding.<br /><br /><br />\r\nAnnexes A through E and G contain normative
    requirements and are an integral part of ISO/IEC 14496-10:2008. Annex A defines
    eleven profiles (Baseline, Main, Extended, High, High 10, High 4:2:2, High 4:4:4
    Predictive, High 10 Intra, High 4:2:2 Intra, High 4:4:4 Intra, and CAVLC 4:4:4
    Intra), each being tailored to a group of application domains, and also defines
    levels of capability within each of these profiles. Annex B specifies the syntax
    and semantics of a byte stream format for delivery of the coded video as an ordered
    stream of bytes or bits. Annex C specifies the Hypothetical Reference Decoder
    and its use to check bitstream and decoder conformance. Annex D specifies syntax
    and semantics for Supplemental Enhancement Information message payloads. Annex
    E specifies syntax and semantics of the Video Usability Information parameters
    of coded video sequences. Annex G specifies scalable video coding in three additional
    profiles (Scalable Baseline, Scalable High, and Scalable High Intra) which enable
    a coded video bitstream to be structured into layers, such that layered subsets
    of the bitstream can be independently decodable to provide video quality commensurate
    with the quantity of data that remains in each smaller bitstream.<br /><br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 14496-10:2008 is the fourth edition of the ISO/IEC 14496-10 specification.
    It includes the same technical material specified in the first edition (ISO/IEC
    14496-10:2003), plus the following:<br /><br />\r\n– integrated errata corrections
    that were specified in corrigenda of 2004, 2005, and 2006.<br /><br />\r\n– enhancements
    primarily for high-resolution, high-quality video applications that were specified
    in a 2004 amendment referred to as \"Fidelity Range Extensions\" and a 2007 amendment
    referred to as \"Professional Application Extensions\".<br /><br />\r\n– enhancements
    supporting additional color spaces and aspect ratio definitions specified in a
    2007 amendment.<br /><br />\r\nenhancements supporting scalable video coding as
    specified in a 2007 amendment."
