abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006 identifies key use cases for communication with
    or between IP-based Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) involving public
    next generation networks (NGN), analyses these use cases in terms of available
    or planned standardized technology and identifies requirements that will have
    to be met.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006 investigates configurations involving NGCNs
    and NGNs and their interoperating requirements. Non-IP-based interoperation, i.e.
    using circuit-switched technology, between NGCNs and NGNs is outside the scope
    of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006 does not discriminate between
    wireless and wired access technology. The Terminal Equipment (TE) interface within
    an NGCN is outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006.</p><p>All mobility aspects
    are outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006. They are covered by a companion
    Technical Report, ISO/IEC TR 26927.</p><p>Application considerations such as IP
    Centrex and CSTA (Computer Supported Telecommunications Applications) are outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006.</p>"
