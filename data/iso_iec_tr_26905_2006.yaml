abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006 identifies key use cases for communication with or
    between IP-based Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN) involving public next
    generation networks (NGN), analyses these use cases in terms of available or planned
    standardized technology and identifies requirements that will have to be met.    ISO/IEC
    TR 26905:2006 investigates configurations involving NGCNs and NGNs and their interoperating
    requirements. Non-IP-based interoperation, i.e. using circuit-switched technology,
    between NGCNs and NGNs is outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006.   ISO/IEC
    TR 26905:2006 does not discriminate between wireless and wired access technology.
    The Terminal Equipment (TE) interface within an NGCN is outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    TR 26905:2006.   All mobility aspects are outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006.
    They are covered by a companion Technical Report, ISO/IEC TR 26927.   Application
    considerations such as IP Centrex and CSTA (Computer Supported Telecommunications
    Applications) are outside the scope of ISO/IEC TR 26905:2006.
