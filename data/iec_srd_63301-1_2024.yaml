abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63301-1:2024 provides an overview of water systems in smart cities,
    establishes a general approach for use case collection and analysis, and identifies
    major stakeholders and application areas for high-level analysis of water systems.<br
    />\r\nThe construction of a smart city can create benefits for a society and its
    stakeholders. Water is a critical resource to support urban development and its
    sustainable use is recognized as a UN Sustainable Development Goal. Water infrastructure
    development, water management efficiency, water supply resilience, and the safe
    operation and use of water are important focal areas for smart cities.<br />\r\nThis
    document focuses on water systems management, specifically water security whether
    directly from a natural source or via man-made infrastructure. Information and
    communications technologies (ICT) and electro-technologies can provide greater
    visibility and control, however their application does depend on the characteristics
    of individual water markets. Technology is not a panacea for resolving all issues
    and problems.<br />\r\nA gap exists in effective coordination and clear orientation
    and how industry and stakeholders are engaged within it.<br />\r\nMajor stakeholders
    of water management and use include citizens, the water authority (government),
    and organizations (associations, business groups, utility companies). Each stakeholder
    has different and competing interests, market relationships and touch points to
    water system infrastructure, processes, operations, management and use.<br />\r\nModelling
    these complex interactions into a systems architecture is a valuable exercise
    in understanding the issues, gaps and opportunities for sustainable water management.<br
    />\r\nThis document focuses on use case collection and analysis to elicit requirements
    to support technical committees in preparing sustainable water management standards
    for cities and communities."
