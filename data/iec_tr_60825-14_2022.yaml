abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60825-14:2022 This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tincorporates changes made in IEC 60825-1:2014;\r\n\tadds
    information to users of laser equipment on administrative controls to ensure safety
    in the workplace, including the training and appointment of people to specific
    laser safety management roles;\r\n\tupdates an approach to risk assessment;\r\n\tincludes
    updated guidance on the management of incidents and accidents;\r\n\tincludes updated
    guidance on medical surveillance for laser workers;\r\n\tincludes revised examples
    of calculations.\r\n\r\nThis document is intended to help laser users and their
    employers to understand the general principles of safety management, to identify
    the hazards that can be present, to assess the risks of harm that can arise, and
    to set up and maintain appropriate control measures. Although the guidance given
    in this document is aimed principally at organizations (whether private, corporate
    or public), where systems of safety management would be expected to be in place,
    it can be applied by anyone using lasers.<br />\r\nLaser control measures vary
    widely. They depend on the type of laser equipment in use, the task or process
    being performed, the environment in which the equipment is used and the personnel
    who are at risk of harm. Specific requirements for certain laser applications
    are given in other documents in the IEC 60825 series."
