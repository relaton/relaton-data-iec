abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 establishes specifications for tagging software to
    optimize its identification and management.<p>This part of ISO/IEC 19770 applies
    to the following.</p><p>a) Tag producers: these organizations and/or tools create
    software identification (SWID) tags for use by others in the market. A tag producer
    may be part of the software creator organization, the software licensor organization,
    or be a third-party organization. These organizations and/or tools can broadly
    be broken down into the following categories.</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\t Platform providers:
    entities responsible for the computer or hardware device and/or associated operating
    system, virtual environment, or application platform, on which software may be
    installed or run. Platform providers which support this part of ISO/IEC 19770
    may additionally provide tag management capabilities at the level of the platform
    or operating system. \r\n\t Software providers: entities that create, license,
    or distribute software. For example, software creators, independent software developers,
    consultants, and repackagers of previously manufactured software. Software creators
    may also be in-house software developers. \r\n\t Tag tool providers: entities
    that provide tools to create software identification tags. For example, tools
    within development environments that generate software identification tags, or
    installation tools that may create tags on behalf of the installation process,
    and/or desktop management tools that may create tags for installed software that
    did not originally have a software identification tag.<p>b) Tag consumers: these
    tools and/or organizations utilize information from SWID tags and are typically
    broken down into the following two major categories:</p>\r\n\r\n \r\n\t software
    consumers: entities that purchase, install, and/or otherwise consume software;
    \r\n\t IT discovery and processing tool providers: entities that provide tools
    to collect, store, and process software identification tags. These tools may be
    targeted at a variety of different market segments, including software security,
    compliance, and logistics.<p>ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 does not prescribe Information
    Technology Asset Management (ITAM) or other IT-related processes required for
    reconciliation of software entitlements with software identification tags or other
    IT requirements.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19770-2:2015 is not intended to conflict either
    with any organization's policies, procedures or standards or with any national
    or international laws and regulations.</p>"
