  content: "IEC 60335-2-40:2013+A1:2016(E) deals with the safety of electric heat
    pumps, including sanitary hot water heat pumps, air-conditioners, and dehumidifiers
    incorporating motor-compressors and hydronic room fan coils, their maximum rated
    voltages being not more than 250 V for single phase appliances and 600 V for all
    other appliances. Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    may be a source of danger to the public, such asappliances intended to be used
    by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this
    standard. This standard also applies to electric heat pumps, air conditioners
    and dehumidifiers containing flammable refrigerant. Flammable refrigerants are
    defined in 3.121. The appliances referenced above may consist of one or more factory
    made assemblies. If provided in more than one assembly, the separate assemblies
    are to be used together, and the requirements are based on the use of matched
    assemblies. This standard does not take into account chemicals other than group
    A1, A2, or A3 as defined by ANSI/ASHRAE 34 [ISO 817] classification. This standard
    specifies particular requirements for the use of flammable refrigerants. Unless
    specifications are covered by this standard, including the annexes, requirements
    for refrigerating safety are covered by ISO 5149. It constitutes a technical revision.
    The principal changes in this edition as compared with the fourth edition are
    as follows:<br />\r\n- 3.127 and 3.128 added new definitions;<br />\r\n- 5.10
    length of refrigerant lines now specified for testing;<br />\r\n- 7.1 changed
    marking requirements for flammable refrigerants;<br />\r\n- 8.15 added requirement
    to clarify the placement of installation panels during testing;<br />\r\n- 11.2.1
    clarification of test procedure;<br />\r\n- 19 (whole clause) replaced in its
    entirety;<br />\r\n- 21.2 added new coverage for vibration considerations during
    transport;<br />\r\n- 22.46 added clarification for PEC;<br />\r\n- 22.118 added
    coverage for use of mechanical connectors indoors when employing flammable refrigerants;<br
    />\r\n- 32 made this section of Part 1 applicable;<br />\r\n- Annex FF2.4 revised
    calculation for calculating volume (V);<br />\r\n- Annex FF2.5 revision of allowable
    concentration of flammable refrigerant gas;<br />\r\n- Annex GG8 new coverage
    added;<br />\r\n- Annex HH added informative annex. Key words: heat pumps, air-conditioners,
    dehumidifiers, flammable refrigerant<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to
    be read in conjunction with <a href=\"http://webstore.iec.ch/webstore/webstore.nsf/ArtNum_PK/44013\">
    IEC 60335-1:2010</a>. <strong>This consolidated version consists of the first
    edition (2013) and its amendment 1 (2016). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.</strong>"
