  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23007-2:2012 specifies advanced user interaction interfaces
    (AUI) to support various advanced user interaction devices. The AUI interface
    is a part of the bridge between scene descriptions and system resources. A scene
    description is a self-contained living entity composed of video, audio, 2D graphics
    objects, and animations. Through the AUI interfaces or other existing interfaces
    such as DOM events, a scene description accesses interesting system resources
    to interact with users. In general, a scene composition is conducted by a third
    party and remotely deployed.</p>"
