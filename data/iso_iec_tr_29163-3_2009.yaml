abstract:
- content: "Within the context of the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM®),
    ISO/IEC TR 29163-3:2009 describes the Learning Management System (LMS) requirements
    in managing the run-time environment (i.e., content launch process, standardized
    communication between content and LMSs and standardized data model elements used
    for passing information relevant to the learner's experience with the content).
    It also covers the requirements of Sharable Content Objects (SCOs) and their use
    of a common Application Programming Interface (API) and the SCORM® Run-Time Environment
    (RTE) Data Model.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29163-3:2009 covers the essential
    LMS responsibilities for sequencing content objects (SCOs or Assets) during run-time
    and allowing SCOs to indicate navigation requests. In addition, guidance is offered
    for providing navigation controls to learners. General subjects discussed include
    the following:<p></p><br />\r\n\tRTE Management: Launching of content objects
    – SCOs and Assets, Management of communications with a SCO, Run-time environment
    data model management;<br />\r\n\tApplication Programming Interface (API): LMS
    API requirements, SCORM® communication requirements, communication error conditions;<br
    />\r\n\tSCORM® Run-Time Environment Data Model: Data model management and behavior
    requirements, Data type requirements.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />"
