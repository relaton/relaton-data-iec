abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 specifies the procedure by which Administered Items
    required in various application areas could be registered and assigned an internationally
    unique identifier. For each Administered Item to be registered, ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005
    defines the type of information that is specified, the conditions that are met,
    and the procedure that is followed.The requirements and procedure contained herein
    apply to all Administered Items specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3. In addition, administration
    records that document the common administration and identification, naming and
    definition details as required by, and associated with, any administered item-specific
    details are also governed by ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005.ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 only addresses
    the metadata that is used to specify all types of Administered Items. Others may
    want to use ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 to register and manage locally defined Administered
    Item types that are not defined in ISO/IEC 11179-3.ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 does not
    address the metadata that is used to specify particular types of Administered
    Items such as data elements and value domains. ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 does not specify
    the registry's system design, file organization techniques, storage media, programming
    languages, etc. to be used in its implementation.
