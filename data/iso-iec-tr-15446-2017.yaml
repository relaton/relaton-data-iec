    <p>ISO/IEC TR 15446 provides guidance relating to the construction of Protection Profiles (PPs) and Security Targets (STs) that are intended to be compliant with the third edition of ISO/IEC 15408 (all parts). It is also applicable to PPs and STs compliant with Common Criteria Version 3.1 Revision 4<sup>[6]</sup>, a technically identical standard published by the Common Criteria Management Board, a consortium of governmental organizations involved in IT security evaluation and certification.</p>
    <p>NOTE       ISO/IEC TR 15446 is not intended as an introduction to evaluation using ISO/IEC 15408 (all parts). Readers who seek such an introduction can read ISO/IEC 15408‑1.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 15446 does not deal with associated tasks beyond PP and ST specification such as PP registration and the handling of protected intellectual property.</p>
