abstract:
- content: "IEC 62862-3-1:2022 specifies the general requirements for the design of
    parabolic-trough solar thermal power plants. It includes requirements for the
    electric power system, solar resource assessment, site selection, overall planning,
    collector system, heat transfer system, thermal energy storage system, steam generation
    system, steam turbine system, layout of solar field, layout of power block, electrical
    equipment and system, water treatment system, instrumentation and control, auxiliary
    system and ancillary facilities, as well as considerations concerning health and
    safety.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to the design of new, expanded or
    rebuilt parabolic-trough solar thermal power plants using a steam turbine."
