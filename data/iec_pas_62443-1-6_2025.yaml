abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 62443-1-6:2025 introduces new communication channels, a new organization
    of functions, and new cybersecurity concerns. Asset owners are looking for more
    guidance in how to deal with all these changes. The IEC 62443 series, Security
    for industrial automation and control systems, can be applied to this new technology,
    but many asset owners look at the scope of the series and wonder where to start.<br
    />\r\nThis part of IEC 62443 seeks to give guidance to asset owners and their
    service providers on how the IEC 62443 series can be used to address IIoT. The
    document points to requirements in the different parts of the IEC 62443 series
    that might be helpful to the asset owner as they both consider implementing IIoT
    in their automation solutions as well as dealing with existing IIoT. Product suppliers
    and service providers can find this document useful as well.<br />\r\nNOTE The
    drafting committee for IEC 62443 is currently engaged in revision of parts of
    the standard to recognize emerging technologies, such as IIoT, and this document
    is part of that on-going effort.<br />\r\nNOTE In accordance with ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 1, IEC PASs are automatically withdrawn after 4 years."
