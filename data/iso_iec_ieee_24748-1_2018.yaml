abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidelines for the life cycle management of
    systems and software, complementing the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288
    and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207. This document:</p><p>— addresses systems concepts and
    life cycle concepts, models, stages, processes, process application, key points
    of view, adaptation and use in various domains and by various disciplines;</p><p>—
    establishes a common framework for describing life cycles, including their individual
    stages, for the management of projects to provide, or acquire either products
    or services;</p><p>— defines the concept and terminology of a life cycle;</p><p>—
    supports the use of the life cycle processes within an organization or a project.
    Organizations and projects can use these life cycle concepts when acquiring and
    supplying either products or services;</p><p>— provides guidance on adapting a
    life cycle model and the content associated with a life cycle or a part of a life
    cycle;</p><p>— describes the relationship between life cycles and their use in
    applying the processes in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 (systems aspects) and ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 (software aspects);</p><p>— shows the relationships of life cycle concepts
    to the hardware, human, services, process, procedure, facility and naturally occurring
    entity aspects of projects; and</p><p>— describes how its concepts relate to detailed
    process standards, for example, in the areas of measurement, project management
    and risk management.</p>"
