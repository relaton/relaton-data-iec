abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60317-2:2019
    specifies the requirements of solderable enamelled round copper winding wire of
    class 130 with a dual coating. The underlying coating is based on polyurethane
    resin, which may be modified providing it retains the chemical identity of the
    original resin and meets all specified wire requirements. The superimposed coating
    is a bonding layer based on a thermoplastic resin. NOTE A modified resin is a
    resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives
    to enhance certain performance or application characteristics. The range of nominal
    conductor diameters covered by this standard is:<br />\r\n– Grade 1B: 0,020 mm
    up to and including 2,000 mm;<br />\r\n– Grade 2B: 0,020 mm up to and including
    2,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe nominal conductor diameters are specified in Clause 4 of
    IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) addition of heat bonding test loads for nominal conductor
    diameters up to and including 0,050 mm;<br />\r\nb) addition of pin hole test
    requirements according to IEC 60317-0-1:2013.<br />\r\nKeywords: insulated wires
    used for windings"
