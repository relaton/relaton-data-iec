abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005 (MPEG-4 Audio) is a new kind of audio International
    Standard that integrates many different types of audio coding: natural sound with
    synthetic sound, low bitrate delivery with high-quality delivery, speech with
    music, complex soundtracks with simple ones, and traditional content with interactive
    and virtual-reality content. By standardizing individually sophisticated coding
    tools as well as a novel, flexible framework for audio synchronization, mixing
    and downloaded post-production, the developers of the MPEG-4 Audio International
    Standard have created new technology for a new, interactive world of digital audio.</p><p>MPEG-4,
    unlike previous audio standards created by ISO/IEC and other groups, does not
    target a single application such as real-time telephony or high-quality audio
    compression. Rather, MPEG-4 Audio is a standard that applies to<em>every</em>
    application requiring the use of advanced sound compression, synthesis, manipulation
    or playback. The subparts that follow specify the state-of-the-art coding tools
    in several domains; however, ISO/IEC 14496-3:2005 is more than just the sum of
    its parts. As the tools described here are integrated with the rest of the MPEG-4
    International Standard, exciting new possibilities for object-based audio coding,
    interactive presentation, dynamic soundtracks, and other sorts of new media are
    enabled.</p><p>Since a single set of tools is used to cover the needs of a broad
    range of applications, interoperability is a natural feature of systems that depend
    on the MPEG-4 Audio International Standard.</p>"
