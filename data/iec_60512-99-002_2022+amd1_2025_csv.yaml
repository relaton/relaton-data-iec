abstract:
- content: 'IEC 60512-99-002:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV is used for the assessment of connectors
    within the scope of SC 48B that are used in twisted pair communication cabling
    with remote power, such as ISO;IEC 11801 1 Class D, or better, balanced cabling
    in support of IEEE 802.3btTM (Power over Ethernet, supporting up to 90 W from
    the power sourcing equipment). The object of this document is to detail a test
    schedule to determine the ability of sets of connectors to withstand a minimum
    of 100 mechanical operations with electrical load, where an electrical current
    is being passed through the connectors in accordance with IEC 60512 9 3 during
    the separation (unmating) step. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition: Test group UEL has been revised with respect to the order of
    the test phases, the test severities and the requirements.'
