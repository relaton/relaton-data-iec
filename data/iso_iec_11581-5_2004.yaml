abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11581 defines graphical symbols for use on a screen, which users
    can manipulate and interact with. They are part of a graphical interface that
    can facilitate the user's ability to learn, understand and remember functional
    elements of the system, and aid in the manipulation of these elements. Their purpose
    is to facilitate interaction between computer-based applications (software products)
    and users.ISO/IEC 11581-5:2004 describes user interaction with and appearance
    of tool icons on the screen. These tool icons are a subset of the interactive
    icons that modify graphical or text elements of an application by association
    with real-life tool objects. These icons represent tool functions such as drawing,
    painting or modifying graphical elements. ISO/IEC 11581-5:2004 contains requirements
    and recommendations for 21 commonly used tool icons. It also specifies the relationship
    between tool and pointer icons.
