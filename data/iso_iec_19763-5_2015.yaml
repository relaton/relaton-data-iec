abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    primary purpose of the multipart standard ISO/IEC 19763 is to specify a metamodel
    framework for interoperability.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19763-5:2015 specifies the metamodel
    that describes a facility to register administrative information and selected
    metadata about process models. The metamodel specified in ISO/IEC 19763â€‘5:2015
    is intended to promote semantic discovery and reuse of process models within/across
    process model repositories. For this purpose, it provides selected metadata and
    common semantics of process models created with a specific process modelling language,
    including Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), UML (Unified Modelling Language)
    Activity Diagram and EPC (Event-driven Process Chain), etc. The metamodel can
    help discovery of the function and composition of a process, and promote reuse
    of its components at different levels of granularity."
