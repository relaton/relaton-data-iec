abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63263:2025 describes a test method for evaluating the lifetime
    of winding wires under electrical high frequency voltage impulses (with partial
    discharges) at elevated temperatures. This method is only applicable as a comparative
    examination under a given sample preparation and testing environment. The comparative
    nature of this document lies in the fact that the lifetime under partial discharges
    depends on a large number of influencing factors in the sample preparation and
    test conditions which could not all be thoroughly investigated so far.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to round and rectangular magnet wires."
