abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60034-31:2021 provides a guideline of technical and economical
    aspects for the application of energy-efficient electric AC motors. It applies
    to motor manufacturers, OEMs (original equipment manufacturers), end users, regulators,
    legislators and other interested parties.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to all electrical machines covered by IEC 60034-1, IEC 60034-30‑1 and IEC TS 60034-30-2.<br
    />\r\na. references to relevant standards have been updated;<br />\r\nb. global
    market data for industrial motors have been updated;<br />\r\nc. guidelines and
    theories about normal industrial applications have been described;<br />\r\nd.
    energy efficiency comparison examples have been given.<br />\r\nThis publication
    contains an attached file titled, “TS 60034-31 Generic Efficiency Interpolation”,
    in the form of an XLS document."
