  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-96:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-96:2024 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-96:2024 deals with the safety of flexible sheet heating
    elements intended to be incorporated into floors and walls below 1,2 m and above
    2,3 m and in ceilings, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    installations and 480 V for other installations including direct current (DC)
    supplied appliances. Flexible sheet heating elements are converted into heating
    units that are incorporated in the building in accordance with the instructions
    after which the required level of protection against hazards is achieved.<br />\r\nAttention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- in many countries, different wiring rules
    apply;<br />\r\n- for heating units intended to be used in vehicles or on-board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many
    countries, additional requirements are specified by the national authorities for
    fire protection, the national authorities for building regulations, the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n-
    heating units intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- heating
    units intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such
    as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- blankets, pads, clothing and similar flexible heating appliances (IEC
    60335-2-17);<br />\r\n- foot warmers and heating mats (IEC 60335-2-81);<br />\r\n-
    heated carpets and for heating units for room heating installed under removable
    floor coverings (IEC 60335-2-106);<br />\r\n- flexible sheet heating elements
    incorporated in other appliances.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 5.2, 7.12.101);<br />\r\nc)
    correction to reinstate the touch current limit in 22.105.<br />\r\nThis part
    2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its
    amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-10)
    has been included in this copy."
