  content: "IEC 60917-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60917-1:2019 specifies
    the relationships between equipment practices and the modular order which are
    applicable to the main structural dimensions of electronic and electrical equipment
    mounted in various installations where dimensional interfaces have to be considered
    for mechanical compatibility. This document also established terms for parts and
    assemblies of mechanical structures for electrical and electronic equipment, to
    clarify the specific relations between equipment practices and modular order.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1998 and
    its Amendment 1:2000. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) added information on newly developed detail specification
    standards of mechanical structures for the electrical and electronic equipment
    practices;<br />\r\nb) added information on newly developed performance test standards
    for the verifications of environmental performances and safety aspects and issues
    of the thermal performance and thermal management for the electrical and electronic
    equipment practices;<br />\r\nc) introduced the relations between the mechanical
    structure for electrical and electronic system, the verification of environmental
    performance and safety aspects and issues of the thermal performance and thermal
    management for the electrical and electronic equipment practices.<br />\r\nKey
