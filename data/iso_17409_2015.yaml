abstract:
- content: ISO 17409:2015 specifies electric safety requirements for conductive connections
    of electrically propelled road vehicles to an external electric power supply using
    a plug or vehicle inlet. It applies to electrically propelled road vehicles with
    voltage class B electric circuits. In general, it may apply to motorcycles and
    mopeds if no dedicated standards for these vehicles exist. It applies only to
    vehicle power supply circuits. It applies also to dedicated power supply control
    functions used for the connection of the vehicle to an external electric power
    supply. It does not provide requirements regarding the connection to a non-isolated
    d.c. charging station. It does not provide comprehensive safety information for
    manufacturing, maintenance, and repair personnel. The requirements when the vehicle
    is not connected to the external electric power supply are specified in ISO 6469-3.
    NOTE 1 This International Standard does not contain requirements for vehicle power
    supply circuits using protection by class II or double/reinforced insulation but
    it is not the intention to exclude such vehicle applications. NOTE 2 Requirements
    for EV supply equipment are specified in IEC 61851.
