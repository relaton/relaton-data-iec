abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-118:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-118:2025
    deals with the safety of appliances for making ice cream and artisan gelato exclusively
    operated by professional users. Ice cream makers intended for professional use
    are employed in commercial environments, such as restaurants, hotels, supermarkets,
    shops, as well as in preparation areas of bars, bakeries, ice cream shops, institutional
    catering, and other similar professional settings. Appliances taken into account
    are those intended for commercial use and similar appliances not intended for
    normal household use but which can nevertheless be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, stores, by artisans
    or on farms, which rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances. Appliances covered by this standard are provided
    with a refrigerant condensing unit which is usually incorporated, but for some
    appliances can be remote.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by these types of appliances including those
    that use flammable refrigerants and appliances employing R-744 refrigerant. This
    standard is not applicable to appliances with a mass of flammable refrigerant
    exceeding the limits specified in 22.112 or to appliances with that use refrigerants
    with a toxicity classification of B according to ISO 817. It does not cover those
    features of construction and operation of refrigerating appliances that are dealt
    with in ISO standards.<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to following types
    of appliances:<br />\r\n– mixers to make ice cream and similar pastry products
    in which, for the preparation of the product, heating process is made within the
    appliance before the cooling process;<br />\r\n– appliances for storing whipping
    cream mix in a refrigerated tank and for whipping the cream for the delivery process;<br
    />\r\n– freezers designed to produce soft ice cream and dispense it directly into
    containers;<br />\r\n– machines for soft-serve ice cream;<br />\r\n– batch dispensing
    freezers.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– countries can
    have additional requirements for appliances incorporating pressure vessels;<br
    />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities;<br />\r\n–
    for appliances or parts of appliances intended to be used outdoors, additional
    requirements can be necessary.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n–
    split systems having a refrigerant charge of flammable refrigerant exceeding 150
    g in any refrigerating circuit;<br />\r\n– ice cream appliances for household
    use (IEC 60335-2-24);<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) scope has been revised (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) requirements for appliances
    employing R-744 system have been added (7.1, 7.12.1, 22.7, 22.111);<br />\r\nd)
    additional requirements for appliances employing flammable refrigerant have been
    added (7.1, 7.6, 7.12, 7.15, 21.105, 22.110, 22.112, 22.113, 22.114, 22.115, 22.116,
    22.117, 22.118, 22.119, 22.120, 22.121, 22.122, 22.123, Annex CC);<br />\r\ne)
    definition of hermetically sealed system has been revised (3.6.113);<br />\r\nf)
    reference to flammable refrigerant has been deleted (22.7);<br />\r\ng) new subclauses
    have been added (22.40, 22.49, 22.51);<br />\r\nh) compatibility tests for winding
    insulation of motor-compressors used with different types of refrigerants and
    oils have been introduced (22.9);<br />\r\ni) Annex AA has been modified to cover
    motors that are supplied at a voltage that is different from the rated voltage
    of the appliance;<br />\r\nj) Annex BB has been updated to align with the latest
    edition of IEC 60079-15;<br />\r\nk) text in 3.1.9.101, 3.1.9.102 and 3.1.9.103
    has been cancelled and the text copied in 5.102;<br />\r\nl) new informative tightness
    routine test has been added (Annex A).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
