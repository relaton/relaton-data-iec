abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the characteristics for identification cards
    and the use of such cards for international interchange.</p><p>This document specifies
    the physical characteristics of identification cards including card materials,
    construction, characteristics and dimensions for four sizes of cards.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    10373‑1 and ISO/IEC 24789‑2 specify the test procedures used to check cards against
    the parameters specified in this document.</p><p>This document specifies the requirements
    for cards and card interface devices used for identification. It takes into consideration
    both human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.</p><p>It is the
    purpose of this document to provide criteria for the performance of cards. No
    consideration is given within this document to the amount of use, if any, experienced
    by the card prior to test.</p><p>NOTE 1 Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial
    measurement system in this document have been rounded off and therefore are consistent
    with, but not exactly equal to, each other. Either system can be used, but intermixing
    or reconverting the two can result in errors. The original design was made using
    the Imperial measurement system.</p><p>NOTE 2 Thin flexible cards are not within
    the scope of this document (see the ISO/IEC 15457 series).</p>"
