abstract:
- content: 'Product interoperability is essential when using home control standards,
    such as the Home Electronic System (HES). Models have been developed to foster
    interoperability among products from competing or complementary manufacturers.
    These models are intended to facilitate validation of the language being specified
    for HES in ISO&#x2F;IEC TR 15067-1: Information technology - Home Electronic System
    (HES) application model - Application services and protocol. Models for lighting
    and energy management have already been developed and accepted. This Technical
    Report defines a typical security system and describes the communications services
    needed. A high-level model for a security system using HES is presented.'
