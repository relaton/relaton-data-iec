- content: "<p>This document defines transport and container formats for JPEG XS codestreams
    as specified in ISO/IEC 21122-1. It defines file formats for working with still
    image and motion image sequence files on computer platforms and gives guidance
    on how to embed the codestream in transport streams, allowing internet-based communication.</p><p>This
    document uses already existing specifications for file formats and extends them
    for the embedding of JPEG XS codestreams.</p>"
