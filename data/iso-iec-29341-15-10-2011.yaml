  content: ISO/IEC 29341-15-10:2011(E) Describes the Content Synchronization service
    which enables two or more ContentDirectory services [CDS] to synchronize content
    with each other. This service also enables a UPnP control point to synchronize
    content with a ContentDirectory service. We refer this service as "CSS" or "ContentSync
    service" from hereon. If a CDS wants to support synchronization of objects and
    its resources with other CDSs, the implementation MUST enable this ContentSync
    service (CSS). CSS keeps change log as part of CDS object property that describe
    which CDS objects are added or modified or deleted since it has synchronized last.
    Since synchronization enables interaction between ContentSync services, each service
    has a Control Point (CP) functionality that invokes actions to other ContentSync
    service to achieve synchronization of contents with each other. This service definition
    is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.
