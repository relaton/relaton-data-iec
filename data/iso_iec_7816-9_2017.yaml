abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-9:2017 specifies interindustry commands for card, file
    and other structure management, i.e. data object and security object. These commands
    cover the entire life cycle of the card and therefore some commands are used before
    the card has been issued to the cardholder or after the card has expired. For
    details on record life cycle status, refer to ISO/IEC 7816-4.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7816-9:2017
    is not applicable to the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside
    world.</p>"
