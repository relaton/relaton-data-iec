abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 25052-1:2022 This document defines the quality model of cloud
    services.<br />\r\nThe quality model of cloud services is composed of nine characteristics
    (some of which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics), which provide
    consistent terminology for specifying, measuring and evaluating cloud services
    so that the stakeholders, cloud service customer (CSC), cloud service provider
    (CSP) and cloud service partner (CSN) have a common understanding.<br />\r\nSince
    the quality model in this document is the extension to the existing quality models
    defined in ISO/IEC 2501n, it can be used with the product quality model, IT service
    quality model, data quality model, and quality-in-use model according to evaluation
    purposes. As there are several cloud service categories, this document focuses
    on the quality model of SaaS (Software as a Service).<br />\r\nNOTE Future documents
    are intended to address PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure
    as a Service)."
