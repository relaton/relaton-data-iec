abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the quality model of cloud services.</p><p>The
    quality model of cloud services is composed of nine characteristics (some of which
    are further subdivided into subcharacteristics), which provide consistent terminology
    for specifying, measuring and evaluating cloud services so that the stakeholders,
    cloud service customer (CSC), cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud service partner
    (CSN) have a common understanding.</p><p>Since the quality model in this document
    is the extension to the existing quality models defined in ISO/IEC 2501n, it can
    be used with the product quality model, IT service quality model, data quality
    model, and quality-in-use model according to evaluation purposes. As there are
    several cloud service categories, this document focuses on the quality model of
    SaaS (Software as a Service).</p><p>NOTE Future documents are intended to address
    PaaS (Platform as a Service) and IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).</p>"
