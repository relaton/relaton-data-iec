  content: "IEC 62680-1-3:2016(E) defines the USB Type-C™ receptacles, plug and cables.
    It defines a new receptacle, plug, cable and detection mechanisms that are compatible
    with existing USB interface electrical and functional specifications. This specification
    covers the following aspects that are needed to produce and use this new USB cable/connector
    solution in newer platforms and devices, and that interoperate with existing platforms
    and devices:<br />\r\n- USB Type-C receptacles, including electro-mechanical definition
    and performance requirements;<br />\r\n- USB Type-C plugs and cable assemblies,
    including electro-mechanical definition and performance requirements;<br />\r\n-
    USB Type-C to legacy cable assemblies and adapters;<br />\r\n- USB Type-C-based
    device detection and interface configuration, including support for legacy connections;<br
    />\r\n- USB Power Delivery optimized for the USB Type-C connector."
