  content: "As the fourth industrial revolution advances – merging physical, digital,
    and biological domains – the industrial metaverse is poised to become a transformative
    platform. The virtual platform could host digital twins of real-world assets,
    enabling enhanced efficiency, predictive simulations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe IEC
    Societal and technological trend report explores the emerging landscape of the
    industrial metaverse, highlighting the gap in current standardization efforts
    which predominantly focus on consumer applications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile organizations
    such as IEC, ITU, ISO, IEEE, and the Metaverse Standards Forum are actively analyzing
    metaverse technologies, only a few standardization deliverables address industrial
    use cases or monetization strategies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe industrial metaverse
    promises significant benefits: reduced costs in product design, testing and manufacturing,
    while improving product quality, and streamlining services. Its unified digital
    ecosystem could yield economic, environmental, and social advantages and opportunities.
    The authors argue that when leveraged efficiently, the technology can also advance
    several UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, critical
    challenges persist, particularly in areas such as privacy, ownership, safety,
    sustainability, and monetization. In consumer space, for instance, adoption is
    slowed by reluctance to pay for metaverse-based services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    report identifies key challenges and opportunities within the industrial metaverse,
    outlines relevant economic and business models, maps the value chain, and defines
    the value proposition. It also presents industry perspectives on overcoming standardization
    hurdles from both market and operational standpoints, offering a foundation for
    future development and collaboration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC societal and
    technology trend report was developed by the Metaverse Sub-Working Group (SWG
    20) of the Societal and Technology Trend Working Group (STTWG) in the IEC Market
    Strategy Board (<a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">MSB</a>).<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/industrial-metaverse\">free
