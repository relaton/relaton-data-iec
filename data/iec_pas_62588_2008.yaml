    IEC/PAS 62588:2008(E) applies to components and assemblies that contain Pb-free and Pb-containing solders and finishes. This document describes the marking of components and the labeling of their shipping containers to identify their 2nd level terminal finish or material, and applies to components that are intended to be attached to boards or assemblies with solder or mechanical clamping or are press fit. This document also applies to 2nd level terminal materials for bumped die that are used for direct board attach.
    IEC/PAS 62588:2008(E) also applies to boards/assemblies, to identify the type of Pb-free or Pb-containing solder used. This document documents a method for identifying board surface finishes and Printed Circuit Board (PCB) resin systems. This document applies to PCB base materials and for marking the type of conformal coating utilized on Printed Circuit Board Assemblies (PCBAs).
