abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62977-2-3:2017 (E), which is a Technical Report, reviews the impact
    of test pattern colour content and image loading on the measured display's photometric
    and colorimetric performance. Experimental data for several display technologies
    is presented to demonstrate the need for using a broader range of colours in the
    test patterns, and measuring the display at an image loading level appropriate
    for the intended application.
