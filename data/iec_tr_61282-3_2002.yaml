abstract:
- content: This technical report provides guidelines for the calculation of polarisation
    mode dispersion (PMD) in fibre optic systems. It accomodates the statistical variation
    of PMD and differential group delay (DGD) of optical fibre cables and optical
    components in an optical link. Example calculations are given, including concatenating
    individual optical fibre cables. The calculations describe first order PMD only.
