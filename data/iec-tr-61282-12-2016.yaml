  content: 'IEC TR 61282-12:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, provides a definition
    for in-band optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) that is applicable to situations
    where the spectral noise power density is not independent of the optical frequency,
    as assumed in the OSNR definition of IEC 61280-2-9, but is significantly shaped
    across the optical bandwidth of the signal. Considering the development of multiple
    measurement methods for different use cases, as detailed in this Technical Report,
    it is desirable to establish a definition of in-band OSNR that is independent
    of the method used and, furthermore, is consistent with the OSNR definition of
    IEC 61280-2-9 in the case of frequency-independent noise power density. Keywords:
    in-band optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR)'
