    <p>ISO/IEC 9075-2 speciﬁes embedded SQL for the programming languages: Ada, C, COBOL, Fortran, MUMPS, Pascal, and PL/I. ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016 deﬁnes similar features of Database language SQL that support embedding of SQL-statements into programs written in the Java? programming language (Java is a registered trademark of Sun Microsystems, Inc.). The embedding of SQL into Java is commonly known as "SQLJ". This part of ISO/IEC 9075 speciﬁes the syntax and semantics of SQLJ, as well as mechanisms to ensure binary portability of resulting SQLJ applications. In addition, it speciﬁes a number of Java packages and their contained classes (including methods).</p>
    <p>Throughout ISO/IEC 9075-10:2016, the terms "SQLJ" and "SQL/OLB" are used synonymously.</p>
    <p>NOTE Additional explanatory material (non-normative) about certain facilities defined in ISO/IEC 9075-2 can be found in ISO/IEC TR 19075-3.</p>
