abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines the technical requirements to be met by contactless
    public transport (PT) devices in order to be able to interface together using
    the ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts) contactless communications protocol.</p><p>This
    document applies to PT devices:</p><p>— PT readers which are contactless fare
    management system terminals acting as a PCD contactless reader based on ISO/IEC
    14443 (all parts);</p><p>— PT objects which are contactless fare media acting
    as a PICC contactless object based on ISO/IEC 14443 (all parts).</p><p>This document
    addresses interoperability of consumer-market NFC mobile devices, compliant to
    NFC Forum specifications, with above mentioned PT devices, aligns with ISO/IEC
    14443 (all parts) and does not seek to limit compliance for PT readers with EMV
    Contactless Interface Specification.</p>"
