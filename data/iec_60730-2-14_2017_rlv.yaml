abstract:
- content: "IEC 60730-2-14:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60730-2-14:2017
    applies to electric actuators for use in, on, or in association with equipment
    for household and similar use. The equipment may use electricity, gas, oil, solid
    fuel, solar thermal energy, etc., or a combination thereof.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard is applicable to controls for building automation within the scope of
    ISO 16484. This part 2-14 also applies to automatic electrical controls for equipment
    that may be used by the public, such as equipment intended to be used in shops,
    offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial applications.<br />\r\nEXAMPLE
    Controls for commercial catering, heating and air-conditioning equipment. Electric
    actuators for appliances are within the scope of IEC 60335.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 1995, its Amendment
    1 (2001) and its Amendment 2 (2007). This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition: adapting it to the 5th Ed of IEC 60730-1, addition of
    checking electric actuators with action 1.AB or 2AB, and modification of tests
    under abnormal condition. This Part 2-14 is intended to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 60730-1. It was established on the basis of the 5th edition of that standard
    (2013). Consideration may be given to future editions of, or amendments to, IEC
    60730-1. This part 2-14 supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC
    60730-1, so as to convert that publication into the IEC standard: Particular requirements
    for electric actuators. Where this part 2-14 states \"addition\", \"modification\"
    or \"replacement\", the relevant requirement, test specification or explanatory
    matter in part 1 should be adapted accordingly. Where no change is necessary part
    2-14 indicates that the relevant clause or subclause applies.<br /><br />\r\nKey
    words: Automatic Controls, Electric Actuators"
