  content: "IEC 61753-061-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61753-061-2:2020
    contains the minimum test and measurement requirements and severities which a
    fibre optic isolator as specified by IEC 61202-1 satisfies in order to be categorized
    as meeting the requirements of isolators used in controlled environments as specified
    in IEC 61753-1. The requirements cover single-mode pigtailed style polarization
    independent isolators for category C used in controlled environments. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012 and constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of the detail
    high optical power test procedures and the condition in Annex B;<br />\r\n- change
    of test conditions harmonizing with IEC 61753-1:2018;<br />\r\n- addition of category
    CHD;<br />\r\n- addition of the detailed measurements conditions in Annex C;<br
    />\r\n- change of clause structure accordance with the latest ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 2.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-05) has been included
    in this copy."
