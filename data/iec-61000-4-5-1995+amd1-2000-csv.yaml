abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Relates to the immunity requirements, test methods, and range of recommended
    test levels for equipment to unidirectional surges caused by overvoltages from
    switching and lightning transients. Several test levels are defined which relate
    to different environment and installation conditions. These requirements are developed
    for and are applicable to electrical and electronic equipment. Establishes a common
    reference for evaluating the performance of equipment when subjected to high-energy
    disturbances on the power and inter-connection lines.
