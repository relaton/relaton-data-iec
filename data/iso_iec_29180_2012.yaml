abstract:
- content: 'The recent advancement of wireless-based communication technology and
    electronics has facilitated the implementation of a low-cost, low-power sensor
    network. Basically, a ubiquitous sensor network (USN) consists of three parts:
    a sensor network consisting of a large number of sensor nodes, a base station
    (also known as a gateway) interfacing between the sensor network and an application
    server, and the application server controlling the sensor node in the sensor network
    or collecting the sensed information from the sensor nodes in the sensor network.ISO/IEC
    29180:2012 describes the security threats to and security requirements of the
    USN. In addition, it categorizes the security technologies according to the security
    functions that satisfy the said security requirements and where the security technologies
    are applied in the security model of the USN. Finally, the security functional
    requirements and security technologies for the USN are presented.'
