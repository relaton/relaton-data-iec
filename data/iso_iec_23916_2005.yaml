abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    23916:2005 specifies call transfer interworking between the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) and \"QSIG\" within corporate telecommunication networks (CN),
    also known as enterprise networks.<br />\r\n\"QSIG\" is a signalling protocol
    that operates between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) within
    a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides circuit-switched
    basic services and supplementary services to its users.<br />\r\nSIP is an application
    layer protocol for establishing, terminating and modifying multimedia sessions.
    It is typically carried over IP. Telephone calls are considered as a type of multimedia
    session where just audio is exchanged.<br />\r\nAs the support of telephony within
    corporate networks evolves from circuit-switched technology to Internet technology,
    the two technologies will co-exist in many networks for a period, perhaps several
    years. Therefore, there is a need to be able to establish, modify, terminate and
    transfer sessions involving participants in the SIP network and participants in
    the QSIG network. Such calls are supported by gateways that perform interworking
    between SIP and QSIG.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 23916:2005 specifies SIP-QSIG signalling
    interworking for transfer services between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate
    IP network employing SIP."
