  content: IEC 63241-2-19:2025 applies to jointers. This document is to be used in
    conjunction with the first edition of IEC 63241-1:2023. The attention of National
    Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations
    may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.
