abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the supplementary service Simple
    Dialog (SS-SD), which is applicable to various basic</p><p>services supported
    by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified
    in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>Supplementary service SD enables a user to communicate
    with another user or application by the exchange of keypad and</p><p>display information
    transparently over a PISN.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three
    stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. This International</p><p>Standard
    contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-SD. The stage 1 specification
    (clause 6) specifies the</p><p>supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs.
    The stage 2 specification (clause 7) specifies the functional entities involved</p><p>in
    the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>"
