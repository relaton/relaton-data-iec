abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the supplementary service Simple Dialog (SS-SD),
    which is applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated
    Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nSupplementary
    service SD enables a user to communicate with another user or application by the
    exchange of keypad and display information transparently over a PISN.<br />\r\nService
    specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. This International<br />\r\nStandard contains the stage 1 and
    stage 2 specifications of SS-SD. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies
    the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification
    (clause 7) specifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary service
    and the information flows between them."
