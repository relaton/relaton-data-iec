abstract:
- content: "IEC 60645-6:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 606045-6:2022
    applies to instruments designed primarily for the measurement of otoacoustic emissions
    in the human external auditory meatus evoked by acoustic probe stimuli. This document
    defines the characteristics to be specified by the manufacturer, specifies minimum
    mandatory functions for two types of instruments and provides performance specifications
    applicable to both instrument types. This document describes methods to be used
    to demonstrate conformance with the specifications in this document and guidance
    on methods for periodic calibration. The purpose of this document is to ensure
    that measurements made under comparable test conditions with different instruments
    complying with this document will be consistent. Instruments can provide a measurement
    function not specifically within the scope of this document and still comply with
    the relevant requirements of this document for the functions that are within the
    scope. This document is not intended to restrict development or incorporation
    of new features, nor to discourage innovative approaches. IEC 606045-6:2022 cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the nominal test frequency used
    in DPOAE is now defined as the higher of the two frequencies, f2;<br />\r\nb)
    the permitted deviation of the stimulus signal for TEOAE has been specified;<br
    />\r\nc) the frequency range for DPOAE stimulus signals has been redefined,<br
    />\r\nd) the stimulus level requirements for TEOAE have been redefined;<br />\r\ne)
    the stimulus level requirements for DPOAE have been redefined;<br />\r\nf) the
    harmonic distortion requirements for DPOAE have been redefined;<br />\r\ng) a
    minimum measurement range for DPOAE has been added."
