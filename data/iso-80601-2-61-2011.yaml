  content: ISO 80601-2-61:2011 applies to the basic safety and essential performance
    of pulse oximeter equipment intended for use on humans, hereafter referred to
    as ME equipment. This includes any part necessary for normal use, including the
    pulse oximeter monitor, pulse oximeter probe, and probe cable extender. These
    requirements also apply to pulse oximeter equipment, including pulse oximeter
    monitors, pulse oximeter probes and probe cable extenders, which have been reprocessed.
    The intended use of pulse oximeter equipment includes, but is not limited to,
    the estimation of arterial oxygen haemoglobin saturation and pulse rate of patients
    in professional healthcare institutions as well as patients in the home healthcare
    environment. ISO 80601-2-61:2011 is not applicable to pulse oximeter equipment
    intended for use in laboratory research applications nor to oximeters that require
    a blood sample from the patient. ISO 80601-2-61:2011 can also be applied to pulse
    oximeter equipment and their accessories used for compensation or alleviation
    of disease, injury or disability. ISO 80601-2-61:2011 is not applicable to pulse
    oximeter equipment intended solely for foetal use. ISO 80601-2-61:2011 is not
    applicable to remote or slave (secondary) devices that display SpO2 values that
    are located outside of the patient environment.
