  content: IEC/PAS 61169-43:2010 provides information and rules for preparation of
    detail specification of RBMA series blind mating RF connectors together with the
    pro forma blank detail specification. It also prescribes mating face dimensions
    for general connectors - grade 2, dimensional details of standard test connectors
    - grade 0, gauging information and tests selected from IEC 61169-1, applicable
    to all detail specifications relating to RBMA series blind mating RF connectors.
    It indicates recommended performance characteristics to be considered when writing
    a detail specification and it covers test schedules and inspection requirements
    for assessment levels M and H. RBMA series connectors with characteristic impedance
    50 ohm are normally used in microwave, telecommunication, wireless and other fields,
    connecting with RF cables or micro-strips. The operating frequency limit is up
    to 12,4 GHz.
