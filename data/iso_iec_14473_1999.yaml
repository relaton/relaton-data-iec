abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard is intended to facilitate user selection
    of an image scanner. This International Standard</p><p>specifies the minimum information
    that shall be included by manufacturers in their specification sheets for scanners.</p><p>This
    International Standard is made for the average end user. For this reason it does
    not describe all specifications</p><p>of scanners with special features such as
    double sided scanning or high speed. By insuring consistency of</p><p>specification
    of scanner product information, this International Standard enables the end user
    to make meaningful</p><p>comparisons of machine functionality and performance
    characteristics. The most meaningful parameters of function</p><p>and performance
    are specified and defined, and measures of performance are provided.</p><p>This
    International Standard further applies to types of scanners which are most prevalent
    in use, including</p><p>parameters for a scanning engine (an optomechanical physical
    device) and basic image processing only (those</p><p>processes include digital
    data output with encoded gray scale, or unencoded single bit plus halftone data).
    It does not</p><p>require specification of advanced application processing such
    as OCR, translation, vector conversion, etc. Because</p><p>scanners use both software
    and/or hardware to achieve some scanner functions and controls, the standard contains</p><p>some
    entries related to software even though the standard is primarily for scanner
    hardware. The manufacturer, at</p><p>his option, may include description of such
    additional functionality which may be provided. This standard also does</p><p>not
    consider image quality, nor does it provide or use related test targets.</p>"
