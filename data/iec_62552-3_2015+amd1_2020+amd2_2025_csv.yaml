abstract:
- content: "IEC 62552-3:2015+AMD1:2020+AMD2:2025 CSV specifies the essential characteristics
    of household and similar refrigerating appliances cooled by internal natural convection
    or forced air circulation, and establishes test methods for checking these characteristics.
    This part of IEC 62552 describes the methods for the determination of energy consumption
    characteristics and defines how these can be assembled to estimate energy consumption
    under different usage and climate conditions. This part of IEC 62552 also defines
    the determination of volume.<br />\r\n- All parts of the standard have been largely
    rewritten and updated to cope with new testing requirements, new product configurations,
    the advent of electronic product controls and computer based test-room data collection
    and processing equipment.<br />\r\n- For more efficient analysis and to better
    characterise the key product characteristics under different operating conditions,
    the test data from many of the energy tests in Part 3 (this part) is now split
    into components (such as steady state operation and defrost and recovery). The
    approach to determination of energy consumption has been completely revised, with
    many internal checks now included to ensure that data complying with the requirements
    of the standard is as accurate as possible and of high quality.<br />\r\n- Part
    3 (this part) now provides a method to quantify each of the relevant energy components
    and approaches on how these can be combined to estimate energy under different
    conditions on the expectation that different regions will select components and
    weightings that are most applicable when setting both their local performance
    and energy efficiency criteria while using a single set of global test measurements.<br
    />\r\n- For energy consumption measurements in Part 3 (this part), no thermal
    mass (test packages) is included in any compartment and compartment temperatures
    are based on the average of air temperature sensors (compared to the temperature
    in the warmest test package). There are also significant differences in the position
    of temperature sensors in unfrozen compartments.<br />\r\n- The energy consumption
    test in Part 3 (this part) now has two specified ambient temperatures (16°C and
    32°C).<br />\r\n- A load processing energy efficiency test has been added in Part
    3 (this part).<br />\r\n- Tests (both performance (Part 2) and energy (Part 3
    (this part)) have been added for wine storage appliances."
