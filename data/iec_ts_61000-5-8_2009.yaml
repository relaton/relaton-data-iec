abstract:
- content: IEC&#x2F;TS 61000-5-8:2009(E) provides guidance on how to protect the distributed
    infrastructure (power, telecommunications, transportation and pipeline networks,
    etc.) from the threat of a high altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP). In order
    to accomplish this goal, it is necessary to describe the special aspects of the
    HEMP threat to electrical&#x2F;electronic systems that are connected and distributed
    in nature. In particular a nuclear burst at a typical altitude of 100 km will
    illuminate the Earth to a ground radius from the point directly under the burst
    to a range of 1 100 km. This means that any distributed and connected infrastructure
    such as power or telecommunications will observe disturbances simultaneously over
    a wide area. This type of situation is not normally considered in the EMC or HEMP
    protection of facilities that are part of a distributed network as the impact
    of a local disturbance is usually evaluated only locally. IEC&#x2F;TS 61000-5-8:2009
    provides general information concerning the disturbance levels and protection
    methods for all types of distributed infrastructures. Due to its importance to
    all other parts of the infrastructure, the distributed electric power system (power
    substations, generation plants and control centres) and its protection are described
    in more detail. While the telecommunication system is also critical to most of
    the other distributed infrastructures, the protection of the telecommunication
    network from HEMP and other electromagnetic threats is covered by the work done
    by ITU-T. This technical specification forms Part 5-8 of IEC 61000. It has the
    status of a basic EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide 107.
