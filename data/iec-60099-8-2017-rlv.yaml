  content: "IEC 60099-8:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60099-8:2017
    covers metal-oxide surge arresters with external series gap (externally gapped
    line arresters (EGLA)) that are applied on overhead transmission and distribution
    lines, only to protect insulator assemblies from lightning-caused flashovers.
    \ This document defines surge arresters to protect the insulator assembly from
    lightning-caused over-voltages only. Therefore, and since metal-oxide resistors
    are not permanently connected to the line, the following items are not considered
    for this document:<br />\r\n- switching impulse spark-over voltage;<br />\r\n-
    residual voltage at steep current and switching current impulse;<br />\r\n- thermal
    stability;<br />\r\n- long-duration current impulse withstand duty;<br />\r\n-
    power-frequency voltage versus time characteristics of an arrester;<br />\r\n-
    disconnector test;<br />\r\n- aging duties by power-frequency voltage.<br />\r\nConsidering
    the particular design concept and the special application on overhead transmission
    and distribution lines, some unique requirements and tests are introduced, such
    as the verification test for coordination between insulator withstand and EGLA
    protective level, the follow current interrupting test, mechanical load tests,
    etc. Designs with the EGLA's external series gap installed in parallel to an insulator
    are not covered by this document. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\nThe Lightning discharge capability test has
    been completely re-written and re-named to Test to verify the repetitive charge
    transfer rating, Qrs with lightning discharges to reflect changes introduced in
    IEC 60099-4 Ed.3 (2014) regarding new methods for rating the energy and charge
    handling capability of metal-oxide arresters. In addition to testing to evaluate
    the performance of the MO resistors, procedures for evaluating the performance
    of the EGLA series gaps have been introduced.<br />\r\n- Omissions from Ed. 1
    of this standard have been included, notably an RIV test and a means for determining
    the thermal time constant of the SUV portion of the EGLA.<br />\r\n- Definitions
    for new terms have been added<br />\r\n- A number of NOTES in Ed. 1 have been
    converted to normative requirements<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: externally gapped
    line arresters (EGLA), lightning-caused over-voltages"
