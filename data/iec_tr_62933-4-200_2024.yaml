abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62933-4-200:2024 describes aspects on reduction of greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions associated with electrical energy storage systems (EES systems),
    and presents current practices, research activities and related researches in
    each country.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to be used by those involved
    in design, development and use of EES systems, the grids and the renewable energy
    sources in the grids, where various applications, including but not limited to
    long term ones (peak shaving, load levelling, backup power, etc.) and short term
    ones (frequency regulation, renewable energy stabilization, etc.), are considered."
