abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 16512-2:2011 specifies the relayed multicast protocol for simplex
    group applications (RMCP-2), an application-layer protocol, which constructs a
    multicast tree for data delivery from one sender to multiple receivers over the
    Internet where IP multicast is not fully deployed.It defines a basic RMCP-2 protocol
    without security features, and a secure RMCP-2 protocol that adds security features
    to the basic protocol. Both protocols specify a series of functions and procedures
    for multicast agents to construct a one-to-many relayed data path and to relay
    simplex data. They also specify the operations of the session manager to manage
    multicast sessions.These protocols can be used for applications that require one-to-many
    data delivery services, such as multimedia streaming services or file dissemination
    services.ISO/IEC 16512-2:2011 also defines a membership authentication procedure
    for use with the secure RMCP-2 protocol and provides informative material related
    to the protocols.
