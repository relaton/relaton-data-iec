abstract:
- content: "CISPR TR 18-3:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nCISPR TR 18-3:2017
    which is a technical report, applies to radio noise from overhead power lines
    and high-voltage equipment which may cause interference to radio reception, excluding
    the fields from power line carrier signals. The frequency range covered is 0,15
    MHz to 3 GHz. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- localisation system of spark discharges which might contain frequency
    components up to 3 GHz;<br />\r\n- information regarding equations for predetermination
    of the radio noise level from HVDC overhead power lines.<br />\r\nKeywords: radio
    noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment"
