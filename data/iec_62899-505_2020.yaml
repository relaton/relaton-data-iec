abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-505:2020(E) specifies mechanical and thermal test methods for
    the determination of the reliability characteristics of a printed flexible gas
    sensor, which is operated at relatively low temperature and is composed of a flexible
    substrate, electrode, and gas sensing layer. The examples of target gas include
    in-door air pollutants, combustion gas from a fire situation, and industrial flue
    gas.
