  content: "IEC TR 61340-5-4:2019(E) describes compliance verification testing for
    technical items that are included in ESD control programs, such as those specified
    in IEC 61340-5-1.<br />\r\nTest methods, in the main body of this document, are
    based on those specified in IEC 61340-5-1 and other parts of IEC 61340, and are
    simplified where necessary for the purposes of compliance verification, to be
    performed by competent personnel.<br />\r\nAdditional compliance verification
    tests and procedures within the scope of this document are described in Annexes
    B to G.<br />\r\nUsers can, by reference to this document in their compliance
    verification plan, adopt the necessary test methods described herein without change
    or addition. Alternatively, tests methods described in this document can be adapted
    to match the requirements of their own ESD control program, provided deviations
    in equipment or procedure are documented in their compliance verification plan.<br
    />\r\nProduct qualification is excluded from the scope of this document."
