  content: "IEC 60320-2-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60320-2-4:2018
    is applicable to two-pole appliance couplers for alternating current only, with
    or without earthing contact, with a rated voltage not exceeding 250 V and a rated
    current not exceeding 16 A, for household and similar general purposes and intended
    for incorporation or integration within electric appliances or other electric
    equipment of multi‑part construction for 50 Hz or 60 Hz supply which depend on
    the weight of the appliance to ensure correct engagement. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2005 and Amendment 1:2009.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    IEC 60320-2-4 is aligned with IEC 60320-1:2015.<br />\r\n- IEC 60320-2-4 is aligned
    with IEC 60335-1 and IEC 60335-2-15. IEC 60320-2-4 appliance couplers are incorporated
    into appliances designed and manufactured to these standards. To this end, particular
    attention is drawn to 14.2 and Clause 20.<br />\r\n- It also now proposes that
    appliance couplers with auxiliary contacts be considered."
