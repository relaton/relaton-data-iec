abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 10646:2017 specifies the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS).
    It is applicable to the represen-tation, transmission, interchange, processing,
    storage, input, and presentation of the written form of the lan-guages of the
    world as well as of additional symbols.<br />\r\n- specifies the architecture
    of this International Standard,<br />\r\n- defines terms used in this International
    Standard,<br />\r\n- describes the general structure of the UCS codespace,<br
    />\r\n- specifies the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the UCS,<br />\r\n- specifies
    supplementary planes of the UCS: the Supplementary Multilingual Plane (SMP), the
    Supplemen-tary Ideographic Plane (SIP), the Tertiary Ideographic Plane (TIP),
    and the Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP),<br />\r\n- defines a set of
    graphic characters used in scripts and the written form of languages on a world-wide
    scale,<br />\r\n- specifies the names for the graphic characters and format characters
    of the BMP, SMP, SIP, TIP, SSP and their coded representations within the UCS
    codespace,<br />\r\n- specifies the coded representations for control characters
    and private use characters,<br />\r\n- specifies three encoding forms of the UCS:
    UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32,<br />\r\n- specifies seven encoding schemes of the
    UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE,<br />\r\n-
    specifies the management of future additions to this coded character set.<br />\r\nThe
    UCS is an encoding system different from that specified in ISO/IEC 2022. The method
    to designate UCS from ISO/IEC 2022 is specified in 12.2.<br />\r\nA graphic character
    will be assigned only one code point in the standard, located either in the BMP
    or in one of the supplementary planes."
