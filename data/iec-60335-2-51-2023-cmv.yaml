  content: "IEC 60335-2-51:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-51:2023 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-51:2019
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-51:2023 deals with the safety of electric stationary
    circulation pumps for house-hold and similar purposes intended for use in heating
    systems or in service water sys-tems, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct
    current (DC) supplied appliances. The hydraulic and electrical parts of the pump
    can be in the same enclosure, so that the water flows through the motor and serves
    as a coolant, or they can be separated. Appliances not intended for normal household
    use, but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by ap-pliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in gen-eral, it does not take into account:<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authori-ties, the national authorities responsible for
    the protection of labour and similar au-thorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- pumps for circulating liquids other than water;<br />\r\n-
    pumps, other than circulation pumps (IEC 60335-2-41);<br />\r\n- circulation pumps
    intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- circulation pumps intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour, or gas).<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2019. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the pre-vious edition:<br />\r\na) the text
    has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been converted
    to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) the use of separate connectors to ease
    the installation and establish the supply con-nection has been introduced (7.12.1,
    22.102, 24.1.5, 24.1.101, 25.3);<br />\r\nd) clarifications related to remote
    operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
