  content: "IEC 60204-32:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60204-32:2023 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60204-32:2023:2008
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 44 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60204-32:2023 applies to electrical, electronic, programmable
    electronic equipment and systems to hoisting machines and related equipment, including
    a group of hoisting machines working together in a co-ordinated manner. The equipment
    covered by this document commences at the point of connection of the supply to
    the electrical equipment of the hoisting machine (crane-supply-switch) and includes
    systems for power supply and control feeders situated outside of the hoisting
    machine, for example, flexible cables or conductor wires or conductor bars. This
    document is applicable to equipment or parts of equipment not exceeding 1 000
    V AC or 1 500 V DC between lines and with nominal frequencies not exceeding 200
    Hz. This document does not cover all the requirements (for example guarding, interlocking,
    or control) that are needed or required by other standards or regulations in order
    to protect persons from hazards other than electrical hazards. Each type of hoisting
    machine has unique requirements to be accommodated to provide adequate safety.
    This document does not cover noise risks. Additional and special requirements
    can apply to the electrical equipment of hoisting machines including those that<br
    />\r\n– handle or transport potentially explosive material (e.g. paint or sawdust);<br
    />\r\n– are intended for use in potentially explosive and/or flammable atmospheres;<br
    />\r\n– have special risks when transporting or moving certain materials;<br />\r\n–
    are intended for use in mines.<br />\r\nFor the purposes of this document, hoisting
    machines include cranes of all types, winches of all types and storage and retrieval
    machines. The following product groups are included:<br />\r\n– overhead travelling
    cranes;<br />\r\n– mobile cranes;<br />\r\n– tower cranes;<br />\r\n– slewing
    luffing cranes;<br />\r\n– gantry cranes;<br />\r\n– offshore cranes;<br />\r\n–
    floating cranes;<br />\r\n– winches of all types;<br />\r\n– hoists and accessories;<br
    />\r\n– loader cranes;<br />\r\n– cable cranes;<br />\r\n– load holding devices;<br
    />\r\n– storage and retrieval machines;<br />\r\n– monorail hoists;<br />\r\n–
    straddle carriers;<br />\r\n– rubber tyred gantry cranes (RTGs).<br />\r\nThis
    document does not cover individual items of electrical equipment other than their
    selection for use and their erection.<br />\r\nIEC 60204-32:2023 cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment to the IEC 60204-1 sixth edition
    (2016) especially for:<br />\r\n– requirements for earthing and bonding;<br />\r\n–
    requirements for circuit protection;<br />\r\n– consideration of use of Power
    Drive Systems;<br />\r\n– protective bonding requirements and terminology;<br
    />\r\n– requirements pertaining to safe torque off for PDS, emergency stop, and
    control circuit protection;<br />\r\n– symbols for actuators of control devices;<br
    />\r\nb) reference for high voltage electrical equipment;<br />\r\nc) cableless
    control system requirements;<br />\r\nd) EMC requirements;<br />\r\ne) technical
    documentation requirements;<br />\r\nf) general updating to current special national
    conditions, normative standards, and bibliographical references."
