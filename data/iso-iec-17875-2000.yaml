    <p>This International Standard specifies the Supplementary Service (SS) Private User Mobility Registration (PUMR), which is</p>
    <p>applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>SS-PUMR is a supplementary service that enables a PUM user to register at, or de-register from, any wired or wireless</p>
    <p>terminal within the PISN. The ability to register at different wired and wireless terminals in the PISN at different times enables</p>
    <p>the PUM user to maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls) at different access points.</p>
    <p>Supplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT Rec. I.130.</p>
    <p>This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-PUMR. The stage 1 specification (clause 6)</p>
    <p>specifies the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the Functional Entities</p>
    <p>involved in the supplementary service and the information flows between them.</p>
