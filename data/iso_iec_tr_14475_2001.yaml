    TR 14475:2001 A Private Integrated Service Network (PISN) is a network comprising
    either one PINX or more than one PINX interconnected by Inter-PINX connections.
    This Technical Report is concerned with inter-PINX connections (IPC) that are
    provided by Intervening Networks (IVN), and the way in which these are handled
    by PINXs to provide a platform for inter-PINX communication. Different types of
    IVNs can be used to provide IPCs, in accordance with the scenarios indicated in
    ISO/IEC 11579-1. These are Overlay Scenarios in that they enable the services
    of the PISN to operate transparently across an IVN.<br />\r\nConnected PINXs need
    to co-ordinate their use of IVNs, and appropriate standardisation is needed to
    allow networks to be created employing PINXs and IVNs from multiple vendors. The
    following points need to be considered:<br />\r\n- In general but depending on
    the type of IVN, procedures and signalling protocols between the PINXs are needed
    for the establishment, maintenance and release of IPCs. Appropriate standardisation
    of these procedures and signalling protocols is necessary.<br />\r\n- At the Q
    reference point (a conceptual point within a PINX) channels and PISN call control
    signalling (QSIG) are defined independently of the type of IVN. However, at the
    C reference point (where the PINX is connected to the IVN), the representation
    of the channels and of signalling is dependent on the type of IVN, and on how
    the PINXs use the IPCs. Appropriate standardisation of these aspects at the C
    reference point is necessary.<br />\r\n- In general the relationship between a
    channel at the Q reference point and its representation at the C reference point
    is not static, and procedures and signalling between the PINXs are needed for
    the co-ordination of these relationships. Appropriate standardisation of these
    procedures and signalling is necessary.<br />\r\n- Appropriate mechanisms need
    to be standardised for conveying inter-PINX signalling through the IVN. These
    will depend on the characteristics of the IPC used.<br />\r\nThe aim of this Technical
    Report is to identify:<br />\r\n1. In addition to PISN call control signalling
    (QSIG), what needs to be standardised, in order to be able to inter-connect PINXs;<br
    />\r\n2. General techniques, procedures, protocols etc., that apply to of all
    (or at least very many) types of IVNs."
