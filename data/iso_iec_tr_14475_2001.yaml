abstract:
- content: "<p>A Private Integrated Service Network (PISN) is a network comprising
    either one PINX or more than</p><p>one PINX interconnected by Inter-PINX connections.
    This Technical Report is concerned with inter-</p><p>PINX connections (IPC) that
    are provided by Intervening Networks (IVN), and the way in which these</p><p>are
    handled by PINXs to provide a platform for inter-PINX communication. Different
    types of IVNs</p><p>can be used to provide IPCs, in accordance with the scenarios
    indicated in ISO/IEC 11579-1. These</p><p>are Overlay Scenarios in that they enable
    the services of the PISN to operate transparently across</p><p>an IVN.</p><p>Connected
    PINXs need to co-ordinate their use of IVNs, and appropriate standardisation is
    needed</p><p>to allow networks to be created employing PINXs and IVNs from multiple
    vendors. The following</p><p>points need to be considered:</p><p>_ In general
    but depending on the type of IVN, procedures and signalling protocols between
    the</p><p>PINXs are needed for the establishment, maintenance and release of IPCs.
    Appropriate</p><p>standardisation of these procedures and signalling protocols
    is necessary.</p><p>_ At the Q reference point (a conceptual point within a PINX)
    channels and PISN call control</p><p>signalling (QSIG) are defined independently
    of the type of IVN. However, at the C reference</p><p>point (where the PINX is
    connected to the IVN), the representation of the channels and of</p><p>signalling
    is dependent on the type of IVN, and on how the PINXs use the IPCs. Appropriate</p><p>standardisation
    of these aspects at the C reference point is necessary.</p><p>_ In general the
    relationship between a channel at the Q reference point and its representation
    at</p><p>the C reference point is not static, and procedures and signalling between
    the PINXs are needed</p><p>for the co-ordination of these relationships. Appropriate
    standardisation of these procedures and</p><p>signalling is necessary.</p><p>_
    Appropriate mechanisms need to be standardised for conveying inter-PINX signalling
    through</p><p>the IVN. These will depend on the characteristics of the IPC used.</p><p>The
    aim of this Technical Report is to identify:</p><p>1. In addition to PISN call
    control signalling (QSIG), what needs to be standardised, in order to be</p><p>able
    to inter-connect PINXs;</p><p>2. General techniques, procedures, protocols etc.,
    that apply to of all (or at least very many) types</p><p>of IVNs.</p>"
