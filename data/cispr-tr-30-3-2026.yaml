  content: "CISPR TR 30-3:2026 which is a Technical report , details the construction
    and parameters of a reference luminaire, a measurement procedure and conditions
    for assessment of the radio disturbance characteristics of electronic control
    gears (ECG) for LED light sources applied inside. This document is limited to
    ECGs (also called “control gears”) as well as end-user replaceable ECGs with the
    following characteristics or applications:<br />\r\n- applied in luminaires with
    safety protection class I;<br />\r\nNOTE This means that the mains interface of
    the ECG itself can have either a protective earth (PE) or a functional earth (FE)
    terminal. For details, see 4.6 and Table 2.<br />\r\nlinear form factor, i.e.
    fits within the space provision defined in Figure A.1 a).<br />\r\n- ECGs with
    a rated output power less than 360 W.<br />\r\nExcluded from the scope of this
    document are<br />\r\n- ECGs for applications that are excluded in CISPR 15:2018
    and CISPR 15:2018/AMD1:2024, and<br />\r\n- control gear with only L, N input
    terminals (without PE terminal)."
