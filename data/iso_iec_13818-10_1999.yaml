- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 138 18 defines compliance to Data Storage Media
    Command and Control (DSMCC) standard in 2 steps: the static review and the dynamic
    review as defined in ISO/IEC 9646 Conformance Testing standard [ 1, 2, 31. The
    static review requirements are specified in clause 4 of this part of ISO/IEC 138
    18 in the form of Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) proforma.
    The ATS used for dynamic review is described in clause 5.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC
    138 18 does not specify all the requirements with which terminal equipment intended
    for use in conjunction with multimedia information retrieval services has to comply.
    In particular, this part of ISO/IEC 138 18 does not specify (lower layer) protocols
    to be used to deliver/transport DSM-CC protocol data units. Neither does it specify
    requirements related to safety, protection, and electromagnetic compatibility
    (EMC) of the equipment, or regulatory requirements with which such equipment may
    be required to comply.</p>"
