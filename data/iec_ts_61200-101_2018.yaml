abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61200-101:2018(E) applies to individual DC low-voltage electrical
    installations entirely supplied by local power sources, and not intended to be
    connected to a public distribution network and having a nominal voltage lower
    or equal to 60 V DC within the extra-low-voltage limit. This document also applies
    to DC installations according to use cases TIER 2 and TIER 3 of the World Bank
    defined in ESMAP 008/15 Report.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to shared
    or collective electrical installations which are covered in IEC 61200-102."
