  content: The common measuring conditions and methods, described in this standard,
    are used for the measurement of the performance characteristics of equipment having
    an audio bandwidth equal to approximately one-half of the sampling frequency of
    a system, where the audio information is processed in the form of digital data.
    CD players, DAT recorders, digital amplifiers, digital sound broadcast receivers
    and television broadcast receivers with digital sound are examples. Methods specified
    in this standard are not applicable to systems incorporating bit-rate reduced
    digital audio signals that have data loss.
