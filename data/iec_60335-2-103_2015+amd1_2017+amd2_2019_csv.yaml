abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-103:2015+A1:2017+A2:2019 deals with the safety of electric
    drives for horizontally and vertically moving gates, doors, garage doors and windows
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase drives and 480 V for other drives. It also covers the hazards
    associated with the movement of the driven part.<br />\r\nBattery-operated drives
    and other d.c. supplied drives are within the scope of this standard. Dual supply
    drives, either mains-supplied or battery-operated, are regarded as battery-operated
    drives when operated in the battery mode.<br />\r\nDrives not intended for normal
    household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public,
    such as drives intended to be used by laymen in shops, offices, hotels, restaurants,
    hospitals, in industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nRequirements for drives for doors that may be used in emergency routes and
    exits are given in Annex AA.<br />\r\nExamples of drives within the scope of this
    standard are drives for:<br />\r\n- folding doors;<br />\r\n- revolving doors;<br
    />\r\n- rolling doors;<br />\r\n- roof windows;<br />\r\n- sectional overhead
    doors;<br />\r\n- swinging and sliding gates or doors.<br />\r\nDrives may be
    supplied with a driven part.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by drives that are encountered by all
    persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose<br />\r\n- physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or<br />\r\n- lack of experience and knowledge<br />\r\nprevents
    them from using the drive safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the drive.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that
    in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to drives<br />\r\n- for vertically moving garage doors
    for residential use (60335-2-95);<br />\r\n- for shutters covering doors and windows
    (including locations where the door is set back from the shutter), awnings, blinds
    and similar equipment (60335-2-97);<br />\r\n- intended exclusively to be used
    by trained persons in commercial and industrial premises;<br />\r\n- for specific
    purposes, such as fire doors;<br />\r\n- for natural smoke exhaust ventilators
    not used as windows (ISO 21927-2);<br />\r\n- intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to movement
    of a pedestrian door where such movement is based solely on stored energy.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2006 and its Amendment 1 (2010). It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThe
    principal changes in this edition as compared with the second edition of IEC 60335
    2 103 are as follows:<br />\r\n- modification of requirements in Clause 20 by
    introduction of new annexes.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established
    on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard.<br />\r\nThis part
    2 supplements or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 60335-1, so as to convert
    that publication into the IEC standard: Safety requirements for electric drives
    for gates, doors and windows.<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 60335-1:2013.<br /><strong>This consolidated version consists of the
    third edition (2015), its amendment 1 (2017) and its amendment 2 (2019). Therefore,
    no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.</strong>"
