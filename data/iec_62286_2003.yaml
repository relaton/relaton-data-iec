abstract:
- content: specifies the requirements that have to be implemented in future products
    that incorporate a digital interface, and service diagnostic software developed
    for these products. The Service Diagnostic Interface (SDI) requires the use of
    a PC (desktop or laptop) into which service diagnostic software can be loaded.
    A part of this PC software has to be standardised while another part of this PC
    software is manufacturer&#x2F;product related.
