  content: "IEC 61535:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61535:2023
    applies to two-wire, up to five-wire installation couplers, with or without earthing
    contact, if provided, with a rated voltage up to and including 500 V AC or 500
    V DC and a rated connecting capacity up to and including 10 mm2 and a rated current
    not exceeding 32 A for permanent connection in electrical installations. Installation
    couplers with additional contacts for voltages other than mains voltages are outside
    the scope of this document. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) inclusion of a definition for \"live part\" based
    on IEC 61140;<br />\r\nb) additional optional cross medial documentation, e.g.
    marking with QR-Code;<br />\r\nc) corrections on the consistent use of the expressions
    \"earth\", \"earthing contact\", \"earthing circuit\" and \"protective earth(ing)\"
    throughout the document;<br />\r\nd) addition of missing compliance provisions
    to 13.3;<br />\r\ne) update of Figure D.1 of Annex D;<br />\r\nf) inclusion of
    new Annex F for cold climate requirements."
