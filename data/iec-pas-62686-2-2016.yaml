  content: "IEC PAS 62686-2:2016(E) defines the minimum requirements for general purpose
    'off the shelf' COTS passive components for ADHP (Aerospace, Defence and High
    Performance) applications. This specification shall be used wherever possible
    for components that typically can be applied to operate in high reliability applications
    within the manufacturers publicly available datasheet limits. This specification
    has been derived from STACK Specification S/0003 issue 02. Adoption of the STACK
    Specification S/0003 issue 02 will enable all existing STACK Certified manufacturers
    to be audited by IECQ under the STACK-IECQ joint venture.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/22125\">IEC
    62239-1:2015</a> for avionics applications."
