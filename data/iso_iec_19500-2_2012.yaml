abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19500-2:2012 specifies a comprehensive, flexible approach to
    supporting networks of objects that are distributed across and managed by multiple,
    heterogeneous CORBA-compliant Object Request Brokers (ORBs). The approach to inter-ORB
    operation is universal, because elements can be combined in many ways to satisfy
    a very broad range of needs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19500-2:2012 specifies</p><ul><li>ORB
    interoperability architecture</li><li>Inter-ORB bridge support</li><li>General
    Inter-ORB Protocol (GIOP) for object request broker (ORB) interoperability. GIOP
    can be mapped onto any connection-oriented transport protocol that meets a minimal
    set of assumptions defined by this International Standard</li><li>Internet Inter-ORB
    Protocol (IIOP), a specific mapping of the GIOP which runs directly over connections
    that use the Internet Protocol and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP/IP connections)</li><li>CORBA
    Security Attribute Service (SAS) protocol and its use within the CSIv2 architecture
    to address the requirements of CORBA security for interoperable authentication,
    delegation, and privileges</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 19500-2:2012 provides a widely
    implemented and used particularization of ITU-T Rec. X.931 | ISO/IEC 14752. It
    supports interoperability and location transparency in ODP systems.</p>"
