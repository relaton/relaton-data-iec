abstract:
- content: "<p>This Technical Report describes the functions that may be supported
    by systems using ISO/IEC 16500. These</p><p>functions have been derived by analyzing
    the requirements of a number of example applications from the</p><p>viewpoints
    of a range of participants, including:</p><p>_ content providers _ IPR holders</p><p>_
    service providers _ rights collection agencies</p><p>_ delivery system providers
    _ regulatory authorities</p><p>_ end-users _ business support services</p><p>_
    equipment manufacturers _ financial services</p><p>Applications, tools and functions
    are described from a behavioral viewpoint. The report does not assume any</p><p>technical
    implementation for a particular service.</p><p>The Technical Report consists of
    a main body, and a series of Annexes. The main body introduces the concept of</p><p>a
    contour in the context of ISO/IEC 16500 and outlines its use in compliance and
    conformance definitions. The</p><p>behaviour and parameters of sets of core functions
    and generic tools that can be derived from the functions are</p><p>then presented.
    Nineteeen example applications are analysed and described in terms of generic
    and application</p><p>specific functionalities. The main body concludes with an
    integrated summary listing of the functionalities</p><p>required by users and
    providers of digital audio-visual applications and systems organised under a set
    of</p><p>functional groupings. The User and Market Requirements and the corresponding
    Functional Requirements</p><p>required for the IDB (Interactive Digital Broadcast)
    contour are defined in Annex A. Similar information is</p><p>provided in Annex
    B for the EDB (Enhanced Digital Broadcast) contour. This overall structure is
    designed to</p><p>readily incorporate future descriptions of new core functions,
    generic tools, sample applications and additional</p><p>contours.</p>"
