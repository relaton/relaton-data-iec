abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance for performance testing of biometrics
    when this technology is used on mobile devices with local biometric authentication
    to improve authentication assurance.<br />\r\nThis document aims to:<br />\r\n-
    Provide guidance for affordable and cost-efficient testing and reporting methods
    for performance assessment at a full system level of biometric systems embedded
    in mobile devices with offline evaluation of false accept rate (FAR) claims.<br
    />\r\n- Define modality-specific considerations of these methods.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to:<br />\r\n- verification use cases related to secure
    transactions.<br />\r\nThis document is not applicable to:<br />\r\n- privacy
    aspects;<br />\r\n- secure authentication from mobile device to server;<br />\r\n-
    testing and reporting for presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms in mobile
    devices;<br />\r\n- performance testing of biometric sub-systems such as acquisition
    sub-system or comparison sub-system;<br />\r\n- continuous authentication."
