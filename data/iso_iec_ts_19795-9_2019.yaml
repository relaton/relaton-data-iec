abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance for performance testing of biometrics
    when this technology is used on mobile devices with local biometric authentication
    to improve authentication assurance.</p><p>This document aims to:</p><p>— Provide
    guidance for affordable and cost-efficient testing and reporting methods for performance
    assessment at a full system level of biometric systems embedded in mobile devices
    with offline evaluation of false accept rate (FAR) claims.</p><p>— Define modality-specific
    considerations of these methods.</p><p>This document is applicable to:</p><p>—
    verification use cases related to secure transactions.</p><p>This document is
    not applicable to:</p><p>— privacy aspects;</p><p>— secure authentication from
    mobile device to server;</p><p>— testing and reporting for presentation attack
    detection (PAD) mechanisms in mobile devices;</p><p>— performance testing of biometric
    sub-systems such as acquisition sub-system or comparison sub-system;</p><p>— continuous
    authentication.</p>"
