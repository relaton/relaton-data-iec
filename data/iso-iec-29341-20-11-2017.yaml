    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-20-11:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [14].</p>
    <p>This service-type enables modeling of streaming capabilities of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between devices. Each device that is able to send or receive a stream according to the UPnP AV Architecture will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This service provides a mechanism for control points to:</p>
    <p>a)         Perform capability matching between source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,</p>
    <p>b)         Find information about currently ongoing transfers in the network,</p>
    <p>c)         Setup and teardown connections between devices (when required by the streaming protocol).</p>
    <p>The ConnectionManager service is generic enough to properly abstract different kinds of streaming mechanisms, such as HTTP-based streaming, RTSP/RTP-based and 1394-based streaming.  </p>
    <p>The ConnectionManager enables control points to abstract from physical media interconnect technology when making connections. The term ?stream' used in this service template refers to both analog and digital data transfer.</p>
