abstract:
- content: "<p>IEC TS 62257-9-8:2025 provides baseline requirements for quality, durability
    and truth in advertising to protect consumers of off-grid renewable energy products.
    Evaluation of these requirements is based on tests described in IEC TS 62257-9-5.
    This document can be used alone or in conjunction with other international standards
    that address the safety and durability of components of off-grid renewable energy
    products.<br />\r\nThis document applies to stand-alone renewable energy products
    having the following characteristics:<br />\r\n- The products are powered by photovoltaic
    (PV) modules or electromechanical power generating devices (such as dynamos),
    or are designed to use grid electricity to charge a battery or other energy-storage
    device for off-grid use. The requirements may also be appropriate as guidance
    for evaluating the quality of products with other power sources, such as thermoelectric
    generators.<br />\r\n- The peak power rating of the PV module or other power generating
    device is less than or equal to 350 W.<br />\r\n- The system evaluated includes
    all the loads (lighting, television, radio, fan, etc.) and load adapter cables
    that are sold or included as part of the kit or integrated into kit components.<br
    />\r\n- The PV module maximum power point voltage and the working voltage of any
    other components in the kit do not exceed 35 V. Exceptions are made for AC-to-DC
    converters that meet appropriate safety standards, and systems that include PV
    modules (or combinations of PV modules) with open-circuit voltage greater than
    35 V that meet additional safety requirements beyond those assessed in IEC TS
    62257-9-5.<br />\r\nThis document includes provisions related to safety; however,
    it is not intended to be a comprehensive safety standard. In particular, this
    document is not intended to be used as an alternative to safety standards such
    as IEC 62368-1 or the IEC 60335 series for appliances such as radios and televisions
    that are included with stand-alone renewable energy products. Nor is it intended
    to replace the safety requirements of IEC 62281 or UN 38.3 for battery safety
    during transport, or safety requirements of IEC 61730-1 and IEC 61730-2 for PV
    modules intended for use outside the context of stand-alone renewable energy products.</p>"
