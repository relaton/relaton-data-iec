abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 10373-5:2014 defines test methods for characteristics of identification
    cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross-referenced
    to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the
    supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed
    in identification cards applications.<p>NOTE 1 Criteria for acceptability do not
    form part of this International Standard but will be found in the International
    Standards mentioned above.<p>NOTE 2 Test methods described in this International
    Standard are intended to be performed separately. A given card is not required
    to pass through all the tests sequentially.<p>This part of ISO/IEC 10373 deals
    with test methods which are specific to optical memory card technology. ISO/IEC
    10373-1 deals with test methods which are common to one or more card technologies
    and other parts deal with other technology-specific tests.
