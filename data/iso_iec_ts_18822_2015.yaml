abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015 specifies requirements for implementations of an
    interface that computer programs written in the C++ programming language may use
    to perform operations on file systems and their components, such as paths, regular
    files, and directories. This Technical Specification is applicable to information
    technology systems that can access hierarchical file systems, such as those with
    operating systems that conform to the POSIX (3) interface. This Technical Specification
    is applicable only to vendors who wish to provide the interface it describes.
