  content: "IEC 60404-8-7:2020 defines the grades of cold-rolled grain-oriented electrical
    steel strip and sheet in nominal thicknesses of 0,20 mm, 0,23 mm, 0,27 mm, 0,30
    mm and 0,35 mm. In particular, it gives general requirements, magnetic properties,
    geometric characteristics, tolerances and technological characteristics, as well
    as inspection procedures. This document applies to Goss textured grain-oriented
    electrical steel strip and sheet supplied in the final annealed condition in coils
    or sheets, and intended for the construction of magnetic circuits. The grades
    are grouped into three classes:<br />\r\n- conventional grades;<br />\r\n- high
    permeability grades;<br />\r\n- magnetic domain refined high permeability grades.<br
    />\r\nThey correspond to Class C22 of IEC 60404-1.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- insertion of a third class of grain-oriented electrical steels for magnetic
    domain refined high permeability grades;<br />\r\n- introduction of the single
    sheet tester (SST) method as reference measurement method for this third class
    of material together with a conversion factor for transposition of the SST measurement
    results to equivalent Epstein values;<br />\r\n- update of the electrical steel
    range to take account of the current offers and demands of grades."
