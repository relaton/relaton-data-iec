  content: Reports processes that exist for using semiconductor devices in wider temperature
    ranges than those specified by the device manufacturer. Covers applications in
    avionics in which only the performance of the device is an issue. The wider temperature
    ranges will be limited to those that do not compromise the system performance
    or application-specific reliability of the device.
