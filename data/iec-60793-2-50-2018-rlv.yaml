  content: "IEC 60793-2-50:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60793-2-50:
    2018 is applicable to optical fibre categories B-652, B-653, B-654, B-655, B 656
    and B-657. A map illustrating the connection of IEC designations to ITU-T designations
    is shown in Table 1. These fibres are used or can be incorporated in information
    transmission equipment and optical fibre cables.  Three types of requirements
    apply to these fibres:<br />\r\n• general requirements, as defined in IEC 60793-2;<br
    />\r\n• specific requirements common to the class B single-mode fibres covered
    in this document and which are given in Clause 5;<br />\r\n• particular requirements
    applicable to individual fibre categories or specific applications, which are
    defined in Annexes A to F.<br />\r\nFor some fibre categories (shown in the relevant
    family specifications), there are sub-categories that are distinguished on the
    basis of difference in transmission attribute specifications. The designations
    for these sub-categories are documented in the individual family specifications.<br
    />\r\nThe sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2015.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Introduction of a revised naming convention which better matches with those found
    in ITU T Recommendations G.652, G.653, G.654, G.655, G.656, and G.657. These changes
    are outlined in the scope of this document along with a cross reference table
    for the new names. Annexes have been rearranged to improve clarity based on the
    new naming;<br />\r\nb) Further details on the requirements for 200 micron coated
    single-mode fibre;<br />\r\nc) Harmonization with the following ITU-T Recommendations
    published in November 2016: G.652, G.654, G.657 including revised chromatic dispersion
    specifications, new categories and new application spaces for these fibre categories;<br
    />\r\nd) Descriptions of fibre types have been added to the titles of Annexes
    A to F.<br />\r\nKeywords: information transmission equipment, optical fibre cables"
