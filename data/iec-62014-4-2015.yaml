  content: IEC 62014-4:2015(E) describes an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema
    for meta-data documenting intellectual property (IP) used in the development,
    implementation, and verification of electronic systems and an application programming
    interface (API) to provide tool access to the meta-data. This schema provides
    a standard method to document IP that is compatible with automated integration
    techniques. The API provides a standard method for linking tools into a system
    development framework, enabling a more flexible, optimized development environment.
