abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24775:2011(E) defines an interface for the secure, extensible,
    and interoperable management of a distributed and heterogeneous storage system.
    This interface uses an object-oriented, XML-based, messagingbased protocol designed
    to support the specific requirements of managing devices and subsystems in this
    storage environment. Using this protocol, this International Standard describes
    the information available to a WBEM Client from an SMI-S compliant CIM WBEM Server.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007 and
    constitutes a technical. This edition includes the following significant changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Expanded scope: The range of
    SAN components modeled by the profiles defined in this specification has been
    greatly expanded. Many of the profiles that were identified as either future work
    or experimental content at the time of the initial publication have matured to
    full profiles. In addition, new areas have been modelled and included (e.g., SCSI
    Target Ports).<br />\r\n- Improved organization: The specification has been reorganized
    to provide more information more easily. The experimental content has been incorporated
    into the body of the document, rather than being segregated in an annex, to ease
    planning for adoption of emerging techniques.<br />\r\n- Additional documentation
    of best practices and deployment concerns: The specification now includes a more
    formal representation of common deployment and usage practices, a more complete
    treatment of backward compatibility issues and a more detailed discussion of the
    capabilities of the API, grouping them into a five-level architecture, spanning
    from physical devices to application-level manipulation, and addressing error
    conditions, configuration, accounting performance and security issues at each
    level."
