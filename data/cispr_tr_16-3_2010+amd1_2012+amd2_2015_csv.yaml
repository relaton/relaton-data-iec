abstract:
- content: CISPR TR 16-3:2010+A1:2012+A2:2015(E) is a collection of technical reports
    that serve as background and supporting information for the various other standards
    and technical reports in CISPR 16 series. In addition, background information
    is provided on the history of CISPR, as well as a historical reference on the
    measurement of interference power from household and similar appliances in the
    VHF range. Over the years, CISPR prepared a number of recommendations and reports
    that have significant technical merit but were not generally available. Reports
    and recommendations were for some time published in CISPR 7 and CISPR 8. At its
    meeting in Campinas, Brazil, in 1988, CISPR subcommittee A agreed on the table
    of contents of Part 3, and to publish the reports for posterity by giving the
    reports a permanent place in Part 3. With the reorganization of CISPR 16 in 2003,
    the significance of CISPR limits material was moved to CISPR 16-4-3, whereas recommendations
    on statistics of disturbance complaints and on the report on the determination
    of limits were moved to CISPR 16-4-4. The contents of Amendment 1 (2002) of CISPR
    16-3 were moved to CISPR 16-4-1. This third edition of CISPR 16-3 cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2003, and its Amendments 1 (2005) and
    2 (2006). It is a technical revision. The main technical change with respect to
    the previous edition consist of the addition of a new clause to provide background
    information on FFT instrumentation. This consolidated version consists of the
    third edition (2006) and its amendment 1 (2012) and 2 (2015). Therefore, no need
    to order amendments in addition to this publication.
