  content: "IEC/TR 61439-0:2013(E), which is a technical report identifies, from the
    user's perspective, those functions and characteristics that should be defined
    when specifying ASSEMBLIES. It provides:<br />\r\n- an explanation of the ASSEMBLY
    characteristics and options within the IEC 61439 series;<br />\r\n- a guidance
    on how to select the appropriate option and to define characteristics so as to
    meet specific application needs, using a functional approach; and<br />\r\n- an
    assistance in the specification of ASSEMBLIES. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2010. It constitutes a technical revision.
    This second edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- alignment with IEC 61439-1:2011;<br
    />\r\n- alignment of Annex B with Annex AA of IEC 61439-2:2011;<br />\r\n- alignment
    of Table C.1 with Table BB.1 of IEC 61439-2:2011;<br />\r\n- addition of a new
    Annex D regarding IEC 61439-3;<br />\r\n- addition of a new Annex E regarding
    IEC 61439-4;<br />\r\n- addition of a new Annex G regarding IEC 61439-6;<br />\r\n-
    general editorial review. Within the IEC 61439 series of standards for low-voltage
    switchgear and controlgear assemblies (ASSEMBLIES), there are system and application
    details that are specified by the user to enable the manufacturer to produce an
    ASSEMBLY that meets the needs and expectations of the user."
