  content: "IEC/IEEE 60214-2:2019 is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo standard and
    is intended to assist in the selection of tap-changers designed in accordance
    with IEC 60214-1 or IEEE Std C57.131 for use in conjunction with the tapped windings
    of transformers or reactors. Requirements, references and definitions relevant
    to either IEC 60214-1 or IEEE Std C57.131 are given and their use is described
    in Clause 4. It is also intended to assist in understanding the various types
    of tap-changers and their associated equipment available. These application guidelines
    cover on-load tap-changers (resistor and reactor types) and de-energized tap-changers.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2004.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    title has been updated from \"Application guide\" to \"Application guidelines\";<br
    />\r\nb) tap-changers for gas-filled transformers have been added;<br />\r\nc)
    description of typical circuits for regulation has been added;<br />\r\nd) description
    of basic arrangements of tapped windings with on-load tap-changers and de-energized
    tap-changers has been added;<br />\r\ne) types of tap-changers are explained in
    more detail (e.g. vacuum type on-load tap-changer) and new types have been added
    (e.g. step-voltage regulator, advance retard switch (ARS), on-load tap-changers
    for distribution transformers);<br />\r\nf) selection of tap-changers (on-load
    and de-energized) are described in more detail with respect to applications and
    parameters, which have to be considered (e.g. current wave shapes, operating pressure,
    temperature conditions, overloading conditions, continuous consecutive operations);<br
    />\r\ng) storage and installation has been considered;<br />\r\nh) field service,
    including commissioning, operation, maintenance and monitoring, has been considered;<br
    />\r\ni) safety aspects have been updated.<br />\r\nKeywords: tap-changers"
