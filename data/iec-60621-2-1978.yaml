  script: Latn
  content: Applies to all installations with voltages up to and including 1 000 V
    as well as with those above 1 000 V. Describes protective measures intended to
    ensure the safety of persons from electric shock in normal service and in case
    of fault. Also, particular requirements applicable to TN, TT and IT system earthing.
    Extends the principles to the protection against overcurrent in respect of overload
    and short-circuit protection, together with the co-ordination of overload and
    short-circuit protection and the coordination of this protection with the conductors
    and apparatus. Also, the principles developed in IEC 364 for the protection of
    conductors are extended to the protection of apparatus in respect of security
    of the installation and protection of personnel.
