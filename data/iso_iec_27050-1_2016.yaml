abstract:
- content: Electronic discovery is the process of discovering pertinent Electronically
    Stored Information (ESI) or data by one or more parties involved in an investigation
    or litigation, or similar proceeding. ISO/IEC 27050:2016 provides an overview
    of electronic discovery. In addition, it defines related terms and describes the
    concepts, including, but not limited to, identification, preservation, collection,
    processing, review, analysis, and production of ESI. This document also identifies
    other relevant standards (e.g. ISO/IEC 27037) and how they relate to, and interact
    with, electronic discovery activities.<p>ISO/IEC 27050-1:2016 is relevant to both
    non-technical and technical personnel involved in some or all of the electronic
    discovery activities, and it is not intended to contradict or supersede local
    jurisdictional laws and regulations, so exercise care to ensure compliance with
    the prevailing jurisdictional requirements.</p>
