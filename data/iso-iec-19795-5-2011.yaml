  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19795-5:2011 specifies a framework for testing and a grading
    scheme for reporting the performance of a biometric system suitable for use in
    access control applications. It also allows for specifying application performance
    requirements in terms of the required performance of the biometric component of
    the access control system. It specifies the environment in which and the means
    by which testing will be performed and how the results will be reported. The grading
    scheme takes a conservative approach, using statistical analysis and confidence
    intervals to support the claim that the device performance is at least as good
    as the graded performance indicates. ISO/IEC 19795-5:2011 addresses conventional
    access control circumstances, and unusual or extreme circumstances are not within
    its scope.</p>"
