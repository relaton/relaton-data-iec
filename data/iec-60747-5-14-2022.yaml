  content: IEC 60747-5-14:2022(E) specifies the measuring method of the surface temperature
    of single LED die or package, based on the thermoreflectance (TR) method. TR is
    the effect that the reflectance of light changes with the temperature of a substance.
    This part measures relative change in the reflectance of light from a metal film
    deposited nearby on the metallurgical pn junction as the relative change in the
    LED junction temperature. The surface temperature can be approximated as the junction
    temperature when the thermal resistance effect between the metal surface and the
    pn junction is negligibly small.
