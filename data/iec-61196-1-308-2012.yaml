  content: IEC 61196-1-308:2012(E) applies to coaxial communication cables. It specifies
    test methods for tensile strength and percentage elongation at fracture for annealed
    and hard-drawn solid copper clad metals to be used as inner conductor for coaxial
    cables. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2005. It constitutes a technical revision. Changes from the previous edition of
    the document are the addition of test methods for annealed copper-clad conductors.
    This second edition makes a distinction between annealed and hard-drawn solid
    copper clad metals. Requirements are more precise than in the first edition.
