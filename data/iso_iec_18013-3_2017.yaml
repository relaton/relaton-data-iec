abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18013 establishes guidelines for the design format and data
    content of an ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) with regard to human-readable
    features (ISO/IEC 18013‑1), machine-readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013‑2), and
    access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013‑3). It
    creates a common basis for international use and mutual recognition of the IDL
    without impeding individual countries/states to apply their privacy rules and
    national/community/regional motor vehicle authorities in taking care of their
    specific needs.</p><p>ISO 18013-3:2017</p><p>- is based on the machine-readable
    data content specified in ISO/IEC 18013‑2;</p><p>- specifies mechanisms and rules
    available to issuing authorities (IAs) for:</p><ul><li>- access control (i.e.
    limiting access to the machine-readable data recorded on the IDL),</li><li>- document
    authentication (i.e. confirming that the document was issued by the claimed IA),
    and</li><li>- data integrity validation (i.e. confirming that the data has not
    been changed since issuing).</li></ul><p>ISO 1813-3:2017 does not address issues
    related to the subsequent use of data obtained from the IDL, e.g. privacy issues.</p>"
