abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62282-9-101:2020 provides a streamlined methodology to assess major
    environmental impacts of stationary fuel cell power systems for residential applications.
    The fuel cell power systems can be complemented with a supplementary heat generator
    and/or a thermal storage system such as a hot water tank. The analysis can include
    the import of electricity from the grid or the export to the grid. The analysed
    systems are intended to meet the electricity and heat demand of a given household.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides a set of specific rules, requirements and guidelines
    based on life cycle thinking for the description of relevant environmental impacts
    of fuel cell power systems that can be complemented with a supplementary heat
    generator or a thermal storage system. This document also provides guidance on
    how to communicate these environmental impacts to consumers."
