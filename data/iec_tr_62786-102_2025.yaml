abstract:
- content: "<p>IEC TR 62786-102:2025 provides principles and technical needs for the
    interconnection of the compressed air energy storage (CAES) system to the distribution
    network. It is suitable for the planning, design, operation and testing of CAES
    system interconnection to distribution networks. It includes the additional needs
    for the CAES system, such as connection scheme, grid-connected process and needs,
    response characteristics of active power to frequency, response characteristics
    of active power to current, response characteristics of active power to injecting
    mass flow, response characteristics of active power to pressure, selection of
    the point of connection (POC), electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) and power quality,
    communication and automation, monitoring and protection, immunity to disturbances,
    grid-connected testing needs, etc. This document will report response of active
    power to frequency, response of active power to current, response of active power
    to injecting mass flow, response of active power to pressure, response of reactive
    power to voltage, and grid-connected testing for distributed CAES system, as a
    supplement for IEC TS 62786-1:2023. This document reports the interface needs
    for connecting CAES system to distribution network operating at a nominal frequency
    of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.</p>"
