  content: IEC TS 62910:2020 provides a test procedure for evaluating the performance
    of Under Voltage Ride-Through (UVRT) functions in inverters used in utility-interconnected
    Photovoltaic (PV) systems. This document is most applicable to large systems where
    PV inverters are connected to utility high voltage (HV) distribution systems.
    However, the applicable procedures may also be used for low voltage (LV) installations
    in locations where evolving UVRT requirements include such installations, e.g.
    single-phase or 3-phase systems. The assessed UVRT performance is valid only for
    the specific configuration and operational mode of the inverter under test. Separate
    assessment is required for the inverter in other factory or user-settable configurations,
    as these may cause the inverter UVRT response to behave differently. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition issued in 2015 and constitutes
    a technical revision.
