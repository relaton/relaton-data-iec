    <p>This document defines a test method to evaluate the interference rejection performance of tags covered by ISO/IEC 18000-63 and a heterogeneous wireless system using different access technologies, e.g. radio frequency identification and cell phone network.</p>
    <p>It specifies the general requirements and test requirements.</p>
    <p>The test method in this document makes it possible to compare the relative interference rejection performance among tags under a single wireless interference environment. In addition, this document can be used in a benchmarking test according to requirements in a given application or service.</p>
