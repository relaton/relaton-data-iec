abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    13170:2010 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of a
    120 mm and an 80 mm dual layer DVD re-recordable disk to enable the interchange
    of such disks. It specifies the quality of the embossed, unrecorded and the recorded
    signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format
    of the unrecorded zone, and the recording method, thereby allowing for information
    interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD re-recordable
    disk for dual layer (DVD-RW for DL).<br />\r\nISO/IEC 13170:2010 specifies:\r\n\r\n\t120
    mm and 80 mm nominal diameter disks that may be either single or double sided;\r\n\tthe
    conditions for conformance;\r\n\tthe environments in which the disk is to be operated
    and stored;\r\n\tthe mechanical and physical characteristics of the disk, so as
    to provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems;\r\n\tthe format
    of the embossed information on an unrecorded disk, including the physical disposition
    of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method used;\r\n\tthe
    format of the data and the recorded information on the disk, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding
    method used;\r\n\tthe characteristics of the signals from embossed and unrecorded
    areas on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the embossed information
    and to write to the disks;\r\n\tthe characteristics of the signals recorded on
    the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the data from the disk.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC
    13170:2010 provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with
    an International Standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full
    data interchange between data processing systems."
