  content: "IEC 60800:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60800:2021
    is applicable to, and specifies requirements for resistive heating cables for
    low temperature applications such as comfort heating and the prevention of ice
    formation. These heating cables and heating cable sets can comprise either factory
    assembled or field (work-site) assembled units, and are heating cables assembled
    in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. Bare conductors and protected
    conductors to be supplied at voltages equal to, or less than, 50 V are excluded
    from the scope of this document.<br />\r\nTypical applications include, but are
    not limited to:<br />\r\n- surface heating installed in or under surfaces;<br
    />\r\n- direct and storage heating;<br />\r\n- snow melting and frost protection
    of roofs, gutters, pipes, etc.<br />\r\nElectrical resistance trace heating systems
    for industrial and commercial applications are specified in the IEC 62395 series
    [1] and for explosive atmospheres applications in the IEC/IEEE 60079-30 series
    [2], as are mineral insulated heating cables. Applications in which the sheath
    temperature exceeds 100 °C are outside the scope of this document."
