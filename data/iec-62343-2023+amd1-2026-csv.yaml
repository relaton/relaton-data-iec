  content: "IEC 62343:2023+AMD1:2026 CSV applies to all commercially available optical
    dynamic modules and devices. It describes the products covered by the IEC 62343
    series, defines terminology, fundamental considerations and basic approaches.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is to:<br />\r\n- establish uniform requirements
    for operation, reliability and environmental properties of dynamic modules (DMs)
    to be implemented in the appropriate DM standard, and<br />\r\n- provide assistance
    to the purchaser in the selection of consistently high-quality DM products for
    their particular applications, as well as in the consultation of the appropriate
    specific DM standard(s).<br />\r\nThis document covers performance templates,
    performance standards, reliability qualification requirements, hardware and software
    interfaces and related testing methods. Since a dynamic module integrates an optical
    module/device, printed wiring board, and software/firmware, the standards developed
    in the series will mimic appropriate existing standards. On the other hand, since
    \"dynamic module\" is a relatively new product category, the dynamic module standards
    series will not be bound by the existing practices where requirements differ.The
    safety standards as related to dynamic modules are mostly optical power considerations,
    which is covered by the IEC 60825 series (see Clause 6). This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of terms and
    definitions for optical multicast switches (3.8);<br />\r\n- revision of Clause
    4, listing the requirements for standards in the IEC 62343 series;<br />\r\n-
    addition of Clause 6 (Safety requirements)."
