abstract:
- content: Applies to those components of X-ray equipment which - generate, influence
    the propagation of and detect X-radiation; - process, record and present radiographic
    information in radiological installations with mammographic X-ray equipment using
    intensifying screens with radiological films. This standard defines - the essential
    parameters which describe or affect the performance of the above components of
    X-ray equipment; - methods of checking that variations in measured quantities
    related to those parameters are within acceptable limits, in order to maintain
    adequate standards of imaging whilst reducing unnecessary irradiation of the patient.
