abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 defines the generic architecture concepts in which
    item identification may commonly be required within the logistics and supply chain
    and defines the parameters that need to be determined in any standardized air
    interface definition in the subsequent parts of ISO/IEC 18000. The subsequent
    parts of ISO/IEC 18000 provide the specific values for definition of the air interface
    parameters for a particular frequency/type of air interface from which compliance
    (or non-compliance) with ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 can be established. ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008
    also provides a description of example conceptual architectures in which these
    air interfaces are often to be utilized.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 limits
    its scope to transactions and data exchanges across the air interface at reference
    point delta. The means of generating and managing such transactions, other than
    a requirement to achieve the transactional performance determined within ISO/IEC
    18000-1:2008, are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008, as is the definition
    or specification of any supporting hardware, firmware, software or associated
    equipment.<br /><br />\r\nStandardization of other reference points is outside
    the scope of ISO/IEC 18000-1:2008.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 is an enabling
    standard which supports and promotes several RFID implementations without making
    conclusions about the relative technical merits of any available option for any
    possible application.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-1:2008 also provides reference
    information in respect of patents that have been declared to the developers of
    ISO/IEC 18000 as pertinent and provides reference addresses in respect of regulations
    under which ISO/IEC 18000 must operate."
