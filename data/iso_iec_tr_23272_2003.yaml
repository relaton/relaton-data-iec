abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 23272:2003 is intended as an aid for understanding the libraries
    specified in ISO/IEC 23271, Partition IV: Profiles and Libraries. That Partition
    includes a machine-readable specification, in XML, of the types that comprise
    the standard libraries. ISO/IEC TR 23272:2003, in companion files, provides the
    following items which help to form a traceable chain from the normative XML specification
    to a portable, printable representation of its contents:</p><ol><li> Tool Source
    Code. A program written in the C# programming language, XML Style-sheet Language
    (XSL), and using the facilities of the Microsoft.NE Framework and Microsoft Office
    to convert the XML into files viewable using Microsoft Word. This program, provided
    by Intel Corporation, can be modified to produce other views of the XML.</li><li>
    Microsoft Word Files. These are the files produced by running the tool mentioned
    above on the XML from Partition IV.</li><li> PDF Files. These files are produced
    from the Microsoft Word files using the Adobe Acrobat program. They are viewable
    on a wide range of computer systems and printable on a range of computer output
    devices. In most cases, they will appear visually identical regardless of the
    means used to render them.</li></ol>"
