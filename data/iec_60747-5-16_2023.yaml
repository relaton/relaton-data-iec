abstract:
- content: IEC 60747-5-16:2023 specifies the measuring method of flat-band voltage
    of single GaN-based light emitting diode (LED) die or package without phosphor,
    based on the photocurrent (PC) spectroscopy. White LEDs for lighting applications
    are out of the scope of this part of IEC 60747.
