abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    13870:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Call Completion
    supplementary services at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services
    Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services
    Network (PISN). The Call Completion supplementary services are Completion of Calls
    to Busy Subscribers (SS-CCBS) and Completion of Calls on No Reply (SS-CCNR).<br
    />\r\nSS-CCBS enables a calling User A, encountering a busy destination User B,
    to have the call completed when User B becomes not busy, without having to make
    a new call attempt.<br />\r\nSS-CCNR enables a calling User A, encountering a
    destination User B that, though alerted, does not answer, to have the call completed
    when User B becomes not busy again after a period of activity, without having
    to make a new call attempt.<br />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced in three stages and according
    to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13870:2003 contains the stage
    3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified
    by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13866.<br />\r\nThe signalling
    protocols for SS-CCBS and SS-CCNR operate on top of the signalling protocol for
    basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain
    aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 13870:2003 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between SS-CC and other supplementary services and ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 13870:2003
    is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN."
