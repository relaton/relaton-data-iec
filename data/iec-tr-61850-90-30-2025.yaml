  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-30:2025, which is a Technical Report, describes extensions
    of the SCL Substation/Process Section allowing the creation of a comprehensive,
    IED and hardware independent specification of an IEC 61850 based power system.<br
    />\r\nIt addresses how to:<br />\r\n• decompose functions in SCL<br />\r\n• show
    function classifications in SCL<br />\r\n• relate functions with the SCL Substation
    and Process Section<br />\r\n• relate functions to Logical Nodes and IEDs/Specification
    IEDs<br />\r\n• present information flow between functions in a hardware/implementation
    independent way<br />\r\n• position Functions in relation to \"Application Schemes\",
    \"Distributed Functions\", \"Protection Schemes\"<br />\r\n• consider the relationship
    to Basic Application Profiles (BAP) defined in IEC TR 61850-7-6<br />\r\nThe document
    addresses the engineering process as far as it is related to the specification
    of Functions and their instantiation in IEC 61850 based power system. This includes
    the impact on the SCL Process Section during system configuration.<br />\r\nThe
    engineering process related to the definition of Applications and their instantiation
    is addressed in the Basic Application Profile Document (BAP) in IEC TR 61850-7-6.<br
    />\r\nThe System Configuration process is described in IEC 61850-6.<br />\r\nModifications
    and extensions of SCL are done in a way to guarantee backwards compatibility.<br
    />\r\nIn addition, this document introduces:<br />\r\n• Some further elements
    to SCL that improve the content and usefulness of SSD files and facilitate the
    handling of SCL files for engineering purposes,<br />\r\n• New variants of IED
    specific files: ISD file and FSD files,<br />\r\n• Evolution of the engineering
    rights management, to first improve the usage of SED and add a new concept of
    System Configuration Collaboration (SCC file) which allows collaboration on the
    same project with different engineers."
