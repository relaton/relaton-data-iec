abstract:
- content: applies to the suspension parts of electroacoustical transducers (for example,
    loudspeakers). It defines the parameters and measurement method to determine the
    stiffness of suspension parts like spiders, surrounds, diaphragms or cones before
    being assembled in the transducer. The measurement results are needed for engineering
    design purposes and for quality control. Furthermore, this method is intended
    to improve the correlation of measurements between suspension-part manufacturers
    and loudspeaker manufacturers
