abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 20071-21:2015 provides recommendations for describing audiovisual
    content in an auditory modality for use in recorded video presentations, broadcast
    television, cinema, live or recorded drama, museum and art gallery exhibits, heritage
    tours, news, and comedies, regardless of the language and technology being used
    to transmit and present the recorded or live audiovisual content.</p><p>NOTE 1
    There are many secondary users of audio description, but the primary and intended
    users of audio description are blind persons or persons with low vision and their
    friends and family.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 20071-21:2015 provides guidance on the subjective
    nature of creating audio description.</p><p>It also provides guidance for audio
    description developers (script writers, voice narrators, and organizations or
    groups responsible for delivering audio description) in faithfully and accurately
    representing audiovisual content.</p><p>NOTE 2 It might not always be possible
    to provide an equivalent experience due to limitations in the amount of time available
    for audio description depending on the content being described.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 20071-21:2015 applies to describing audiovisual content and does not consider
    the devices or transmission mechanisms used to deliver the content or the audio
    description. These devices include, but are not limited to, televisions, computers,
    wireless devices, projection equipment, DVD and home cinema equipment and other
    forms of user interface technology. Therefore, this part of ISO/IEC 20071 does
    not consider transcoding files for the various video outputs.</p><p>NOTE 3 Technical
    matters of transmission and distribution are covered by other International Standards
    (e.g. MPEG standards and other technical international standards such as IEC 62731).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 20071-21:2015 provides guidance on how to approach user preferences, available
    styles and flexibility in approaches to audio description.</p><p>It does not apply
    to static images contained in electronic documents (see ISO/IEC 20071âˆ’11 for guidance
    on text alternatives for images).</p><p>It applies to auditory presentations intended
    to be transmitted or delivered simultaneously to the original audiovisual content.</p><p>NOTE
    4 Limitations experienced by broadcasters or people in synchronous environments
    might be reduced online or in asynchronous environments.</p>"
