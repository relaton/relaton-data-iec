abstract:
- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-83:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-83:2024 RLV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-83:2024 deals with the safety of electrically heated gullies
    for de-icing the inlet of the drainage system of flat roofs, balconies, and similar
    structures, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances. As far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances which are
    encountered by all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nHowever, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that
    in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to appliances intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2001 and Amendment
    1:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) removal of test probe 18
    (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
