  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19501:2004 describes the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a
    graphical language for visualizing, specifying, constructing and documenting the
    artifacts of a software-intensive system. The UML offers a standard way to write
    a system's blueprints, including conceptual things such as business processes
    and system functions, as well as concrete things such as programming language
    statements, database schemas, and reusable software components.</p>"
