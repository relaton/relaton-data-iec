abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29167-16:2015 describes a crypto suite based on Elliptic Curve
    Cryptography (ECC) for the ISO/IEC 18000â€‘ series of standards protocol. In particular,
    it specifies the use of Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement in
    a secure channel establishment and the use of Elliptic Curve Digital Signature
    Algorithm (ECDSA) in an authentication mechanism.<p>ISO/IEC 29167-16:2015 specifies
    a crypto suite for ECDSA-ECDH for air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite
    is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29167-16:2015
    defines a mutual authentication method and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag
    and an Interrogator may support one, a subset, or all of the specified options,
    clearly stating what is supported. Key update is not supported in this international
    standard.</p>
