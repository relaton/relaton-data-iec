  content: IEC/TR 62476:2010(E) provides a framework for the use of internationally
    accepted standards, tools and practices to evaluate electrical and electronic
    products with respect to restricted substances. It can also be applied to declarable
    substances which are not restricted in electrical and electronic products. It
    provides guidance on how technical documentation and relevant evaluation and control
    methods should be selected and applied for restricted or declarable substances
    of any producer's product.
