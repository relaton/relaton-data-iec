  content: Applies to all commercially available optical amplifiers (OAs), including
    optical fibre amplifiers (OFAs) using active fibres, as well as Raman amplifiers.
    Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) using semiconductor gain media are also
    included. Also provides a simple informative guideline on the threshold of high
    optical power that causes high-temperature damage of fibre. Optical safety for
    manufactures and users of optical amplifiers by reiterating substantial parts
    of existing standards and agreements on eye and skin safety are also discussed.
