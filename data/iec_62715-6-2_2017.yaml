abstract:
- content: IEC&nbsp;62715-6-2:2017(E) specifies testing methods for evaluating the
    environmental endurance of flexible display panels and modules for use, storage
    and transport under assumed usage environment. This part of IEC&nbsp;62715 is
    applicable to flexible display panels and modules such as liquid crystal display
    devices (LCDs), electric paper display devices (EPDs), and organic light emitting
    diode display devices (OLEDs). This part of IEC&nbsp;62715 will also be suitable
    for flexible panel or module with mechanical operation.
