  content: "IEC 61290-4-3:2015(E) applies to output power controlled optically amplified,
    elementary sub-systems. It applies to optical fibre amplifiers (OFA) using active
    fibres containing rare-earth dopants, presently commercially available, as indicated
    in IEC 61291-1, as well as alternative optical amplifiers that can be used for
    single channel output power controlled operation, such as semiconductor optical
    amplifiers (SOA). The object of this standard is to provide the general background
    for optical amplifier (OA) power transients and its measurements and to indicate
    those IEC standard test methods for accurate and reliable measurements of the
    following transient parameters:<br />\r\n- Transient power response;<br />\r\n-
    Transient power overcompensation response;<br />\r\n- Steady-state power offset;<br
    />\r\n- Transient power response time. The stimulus and responses behaviours under
    consideration include:<br />\r\n- Channel power increase (step transient);<br
    />\r\n- Channel power reduction (inverse step transient);<br />\r\n- Channel power
    increase/reduction (pulse transient);<br />\r\n- Channel power reduction/increase
    (inverse pulse transient);<br />\r\n- Channel power increase/reduction/increase
    (lightning bolt transient);<br />\r\n- Channel power reduction/increase/reduction
    (inverse lightning bolt transient). These parameters have been included to provide
    a complete description of the transient behaviour of an output power transient
    controlled OA. The test definition defined here are applicable if the amplifier
    is an OFA or an alternative OA. However, the description in Annex A of this document
    concentrates on the physical performance of an OFA and provides a detailed description
    of the behaviour of OFA; it does not give a similar description of other OA types.
