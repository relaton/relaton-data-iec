  content: "IEC 63041-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 63041-1:2021
    applies to piezoelectric sensors of resonator, delay-line and non-acoustic types,
    which are used in physical and engineering sciences, chemistry and biochemistry,
    medical and environmental sciences, etc. The purpose of this document is to specify
    the terms and definitions for piezoelectric sensors, and to make sure from a technological
    perspective that users understand the state-of-art piezoelectric sensors and how
    to use them correctly. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the new terms \"piezoelectric
    sensor system\" and \"wireless SAW sensor system\" and their definitions have
    been added;<br />\r\n- new types of sensor modules and sensor system have been
    added;<br />\r\n- some symbols of sensor elements are added in Clause 4;<br />\r\n-
    a new Figure B.3 has been added in Annex B;<br />\r\n- Annex C has been added."
