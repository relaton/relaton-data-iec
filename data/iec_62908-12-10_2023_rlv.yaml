abstract:
- content: "IEC 62908-12-10:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62908-12-10:2023
    specifies the standard measuring conditions and measurement methods for determining
    touch and hovering performance of a touch sensor module. This document is applicable
    to touch sensor modules, where the structural relationship between touch sensor,
    touch controller, touch sensor module, display panel, touch display panel, and
    touch display module is defined in IEC 62908-1-2. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- added hovering performance measurement
    methods, especially in-plane characteristics at a constant distance from the touch
    sensor;<br />\r\n- added pen touch performance."
