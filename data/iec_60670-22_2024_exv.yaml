    accessories with a rated voltage not exceeding 1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC intended
    for household or similar fixed electrical installations, either indoors or outdoors.
    Boxes and enclosures complying with this document are suitable for use at ambient
    temperatures not normally exceeding +40 °C, but their average over a period of
    24 h does not exceed +35 °C, with a lower limit of the ambient air temperature
    of −5 °C. Other temperatures outside the above range can apply according to the
    classification of the boxes and the enclosures. This document applies to junction
    connecting boxes or tapping connecting boxes or both.<br />\r\nThis second edition
