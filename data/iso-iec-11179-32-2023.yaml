    <p>This document provides a specification for an extension to a metadata registry (MDR), as specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3:2023, in which metadata that describes concept systems can be registered.</p>
    <p>The specification in this document, together with the relevant clauses of the specification in ISO/IEC 11179-3, provides the ability to record the following metadata:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>concept systems and associated concepts;</li>
    <li>relations among concepts in a concept system;</li>
    <li>assertions about concepts in a concept system.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The metamodel in this document is intended to support the full description of a concept system, including ontologies.</p>
    <p>Where there is a requirement to register an ontology where the details are defined elsewhere, consider using ISO/IEC 19763-3 instead.</p>
