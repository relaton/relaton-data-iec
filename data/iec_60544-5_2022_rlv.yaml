abstract:
- content: "IEC 60544-5:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60544-5:2022
    covers ageing assessment methods which can be applied to components based on polymeric
    materials (e.g. cable insulation and jackets, elastomeric seals, polymeric coatings,
    gaiters) which are used in environments where they are exposed to radiation. The
    object of this document is aimed at providing methods for the assessment of ageing
    in service. The approaches discussed in Clause 5 through Clause 9 cover ageing
    assessment programmes based on condition monitoring (CM), the use of sample deposits
    in severe environments and sampling of real-time aged components. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- added recent references in 7.4 showing that some electrical
    condition monitoring methods show promising correlations with ageing;<br />\r\n-
    updated recommendations for implementation of a sample deposit in 9.2, installation
    of a sample deposit in 9.3 and testing of samples from the deposit in 9.4;<br
    />\r\n- updated list of references."
