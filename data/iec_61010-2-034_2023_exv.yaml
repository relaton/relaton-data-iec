abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-034:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 61010-2-034:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD1:2016.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-034:2023
    specifies safety requirements to equipment for measuring insulation resistance
    and to equipment for testing electric strength which have an output voltage exceeding
    50 V a.c. or 120 V d.c. This document also applies to combined measuring equipment
    which has an insulation resistance measurement function or an electric strength
    test measurement function. This document has the status of a horizontal publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 108. It has the status of a group safety publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 104. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) in 1.2.1, requirements for protection against
    hazards which could occur from reading a voltage have been added to the scope;<br
    />\r\nb) Clause 2, all normative references have been dated; new normative references
    have been added;<br />\r\nc) in 4.3.2.5, requirements for power supply have been
    modified;<br />\r\nd) in 4.3.2.6, requirements for inputs/outputs have been modified;<br
    />\r\ne) in 5.1.5.101.2, minimum ratings for voltage of measuring terminals are
    required;<br />\r\nf) in 5.4.2, new ratings for documentation have been added;<br
    />\r\ng) in 5.4.4, new instructions for operation have been added;<br />\r\nh)
    in 5.101.1, hazard indicators shall be functional in normal condition and in single
    fault condition;<br />\r\ni) in 6.6.101.1, insulating material of group I may
    be allowed for determination of creepage distances of measuring circuit terminals;<br
    />\r\nj) in 6.6.101.2, Clearances and creepage distances above 1 000 V a.c. and
    1 500 V d.c. for measuring circuit terminals in unmated position have been defined;<br
    />\r\nk) in 6.6.101.3, requirements for measuring circuit terminals in partially
    mated position have been specified;<br />\r\nl) in 6.6.101.4, requirements for
    measuring circuit terminals in mated position have been specified;<br />\r\nm)
    Subclause 6.102 replaces 6.9.103 and has been rephrased;<br />\r\nn) new Subclause
    9.101 to consider the protection of measuring circuits against the spread of fire
    and arc flash has been added. Table 102 has been replaced by Table K.101;<br />\r\no)
    In 9.101.2, relocation of 101.3 of previous edition;<br />\r\np) In 9.101.3, relocation
    of 101.4 of previous edition, extension to measurement category II and reference
    to IEC 61000-4-5 for tests;<br />\r\nq) in 9.101.4, requirements for measuring
    circuit terminals in mated position have been specified;<br />\r\nr) in 9.101.5,
    relocation of K.103 of previous edition with numerous technical changes;<br />\r\ns)
    in 14.101, relocation of 14.102. 14.101 of previous edition has been removed;<br
    />\r\nt) in 101.3, relocation of 101.5 of previous edition, and more requirements
    added against hazard occurring from reading a voltage value;<br />\r\nu) in K.2.1,
    another method for determination of clearances of secondary circuits is proposed;<br
    />\r\nv) in K.3.2, new Table K.15 and Table K.16 for clearance calculation;<br
    />\r\nw) in K.3.101, relocation of 6.9.104 of previous edition;<br />\r\nx) in
    K.101.4.1, new Table K.103 and Table K.104 replace Table K.102, Table K.103 and
    Table K.104;<br />\r\ny) in K.101.4, the subclause has been reviewed. Tables and
    tests for solid insulation have been modified. Table K.105 replaces Table K.9;<br
    />\r\nz) Table K.101, replacement of Table K.106;<br />\r\naa) Clause K.4, redraft
    of the clause to propose a method for determination of Ut for circuits which reduce
    transient overvoltages;<br />\r\nbb) Annex EE: addition of a new informative annex
    for determination of clearances for Table 101."
