abstract:
- content: IEC CA 01:2020 CSV provides a framework and sets out the basic rules for
    the structure and operation of the IEC CA Systems. This harmonized set of rules
    ensures that the Systems operate in a consistent and transparent manner while
    allowing flexibility for the individual Systems to serve the needs of their respective
    customers, providing a mechanism for easier collaboration between the Systems.
    This harmonization also provides an opportunity to promote the use of existing,
    and proven, best practices across the IEC CA Systems.
