  content: "IEC TR 61547-1:2020 describes an objective light flickermeter, which can
    be applied for the following purposes:<br />\r\n- measuring the intrinsic performance
    of all lighting equipment without the application of voltage fluctuations in terms
    of illuminance flicker; during this measurement, the lighting equipment is supplied
    with a stable mains;<br />\r\n- testing the immunity performance of lighting equipment
    against (unintentional) voltage fluctuation disturbance on the AC mains in terms
    of illuminance flicker; during this test a set of defined voltage fluctuations
    are applied to the AC mains and the immunity of the lighting equipment to the
    disturbance is determined.<br />\r\nApart from the above two purposes, the immunity
    performance of lighting equipment can also be tested against intentional voltage
    fluctuation on the AC mains arising for example from mains signalling. This is
    however not described in further detail in this document. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the scope of this document
    has been clarified to make a distinction between flicker testing without voltage
    fluctuations to measure the intrinsic performance of lighting equipment and flicker
    testing in which a specific set of voltage fluctuations are applied in order to
    measure the immunity of the lighting equipment to voltage fluctuations present
    on the mains;<br />\r\n- the test procedure for flicker testing has been clarified."
