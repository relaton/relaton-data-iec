  content: "IEC 61162-460:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61162-460:2024 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61162-460:2018+AMD1:2020
    CSV edition 2.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 80 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61162-460:2024 is an add-on to IEC 61162-450 where
    higher safety and security standards are needed, for example due to higher exposure
    to external threats or to improve network integrity. This document provides requirements
    and test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network
    as well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection
    from the network to other networks. This document also contains requirements for
    a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This document does not introduce
    new application level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of July 2024 have been included in this
    copy."
