abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 20060:2010 provides the specifications for the standard Open Terminal
    Architecture (OTA) kernel in several layers:definition of the virtual machine
    (VM);description of the services provided by the VM to terminal programmers;specification
    of a set of tokens representing the native machine language of the VM;specification
    of the format in which token modules are delivered to an OTA kernel for processing.OTA
    defines a standard software kernel whose functions and programming interface are
    common across all terminal types. This kernel is based on a standard VM, which
    is implemented on each CPU type and which provides drivers for the terminal's
    I/O and all low-level CPU-specific logical and arithmetic functions. High-level
    libraries, terminal programs and payment applications may be developed using these
    standard kernel functions.
