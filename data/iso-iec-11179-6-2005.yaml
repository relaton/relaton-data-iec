    <p>ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 specifies the procedure by which Administered Items required in various application areas could be registered and assigned an internationally unique identifier. For each Administered Item to be registered, ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 defines the type of information that is specified, the conditions that are met, and the procedure that is followed.</p>
    <p>The requirements and procedure contained herein apply to all Administered Items specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3. In addition, administration records that document the common administration and identification, naming and definition details as required by, and associated with, any administered item-specific details are also governed by ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 only addresses the metadata that is used to specify all types of Administered Items. Others may want to use ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 to register and manage locally defined Administered Item types that are not defined in ISO/IEC 11179-3.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 does not address the metadata that is used to specify particular types of Administered Items such as data elements and value domains. ISO/IEC 11179-6:2005 does not specify the registry's system design, file organization techniques, storage media, programming languages, etc. to be used in its implementation.</p>
