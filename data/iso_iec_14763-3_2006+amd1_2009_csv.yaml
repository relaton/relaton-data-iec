abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14763-3:2006+A1:2011 specifies systems and methods for the inspection
    and testing of optical fibre cabling designed in accordance with ISO/IEC 11801
    or equivalent standards. The test methods refer to existing standards-based procedures
    where they exist. It replaces ISO/IEC TR 14763-3, first edition, published in
    2000, and constitutes a technical revision. It incorporates innovations and recent
    developments including guidance in the proper use of uni-directional and bi-directional
    OTDR testing, the three-jumper method as default test method, fibre end-face inspection
    and criteria for scratches, return loss values for SC and non-SC connectors and
    the normative use of reference connectors. However, the most substantial change
    is the application of the 2 parameters which are used to determine the two repeatable
    multimode launch conditions "modal power distribution and "coupled power ratio.
    This consolidated version of ISO/IEC 14763-3 consists of the first edition (2006)
    and its amendment 1 (2009). It bears the edition number 1.1. The technical content
    is therefore identical to the base edition and its amendment and has been prepared
    for user convenience. A vertical line in the margin shows where the base publication
    has been modified by amendment 1. Additions and deletions are displayed in red,
    with deletions being struck through.<strong>This consolidated version consists
    of the first edition (2006) and its amendment 1 (2009). Therefore, no need to
    order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>
