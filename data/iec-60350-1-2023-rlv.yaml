  content: "IEC 60350-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60350-1:2023
    specifies methods for measuring the performance of electric cooking ranges, ovens,
    steam ovens, and grills for household use. This document is also applicable to
    portable appliances with similar functionalities that were previously covered
    by the withdrawn IEC 61817. The ovens covered by this document can be with or
    without microwave function. Manufacturers are expected to define the primary cooking
    function of the appliance – microwave function or thermal heat. The primary cooking
    function is measured with an existing method according to energy consumption.
    If the primary cooking function is declared in the instruction manual as a microwave
    function, IEC 60705 is applied for energy consumption measurement. If the primary
    cooking function is declared as a thermal heat, then IEC 60350-1 is applied for
    energy consumption measurement. If the primary function is not declared by the
    manufacturer, the performance of the microwave function and thermal heat is measured
    as far as it is possible. For measurement of energy consumption and time for heating
    a load (see Clause 8), this document is furthermore not applicable to:<br />\r\n-
    microwave combination function;<br />\r\n- ovens with reciprocating trays or turntable;<br
    />\r\n- small cavity ovens (see 3.16);<br />\r\n- ovens without adjustable temperature
    control;<br />\r\n- heating functions and eco functions other than defined in
    this document;<br />\r\n- appliances with only solo steam function.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to microwave ovens (IEC 60705). This document defines
    the main performance characteristics of these appliances that are of interest
    to the user and specifies methods for measuring these characteristics.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not specify a classification or ranking for performance. This document
    does not deal with safety requirements (IEC 60335-2-6 and IEC 60335-2-9). Appliances
    covered by this document can be built-in or for placing on a working surface or
    the floor. There is no measurement method for the energy consumption for grilling
    and steam functions available. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2016 and Interpretation Sheet 1:2021. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) new definitions for
    heating function, eco function and definitions relevant for low power mode considerations
    are amended in Clause 3;<br />\r\nb) order of clauses is changed;<br />\r\nc)
    revision of 5.3;<br />\r\nd) update of 6.2 in order to improve the reliability
    of volume measurement;<br />\r\ne) removal of 6.7, Level of shelf;<br />\r\nf)
    revision of Clause 7 concerning the accuracy of eco functions with residual heat
    use;<br />\r\ng) revision of Clause 8 in order to improve the reliability of the
    method for measuring the energy consumption, especially regarding anti-circumvention;<br
    />\r\nh) unique energy consumption measurement for all heating functions and eco
    functions with an indication of the energy consumption for a temperature increase
    of 165 K (compared to 155 K currently for forced air circulation function, for
    example), which results in higher energy consumption values compared to the previous
    edition;<br />\r\ni) Ry replaced by L* in Clause 9 and reference to IEC TS 63350;<br
    />\r\nj) cooking time for reference measurement introduced for broccoli in Clause
    10;<br />\r\nk) yellow part replaced by hue angle value in Clause 10;<br />\r\nl)
    requirements for digital assessment (see former 7.5.3.6.3) are obsolete as specified
    in IEC TS 63350;<br />\r\nm) revision of Clause 14 (Consumption measurement of
    low power modes, previous Clause 12);<br />\r\nn) former Annex G (informative)
    is cancelled due to the fact that this method for measuring an associated activity
    has been not applied;<br />\r\no) former Annexes B and F are obsolete, up-to-date
    shade charts are specified in IEC TS 63350;<br />\r\np) former Annex E will be
    substituted by a supporting document located on the IEC's website."
