abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23005-6:2019 This document provides definitions of data types
    and tools, which are used in other parts of the ISO/IEC 23005 series, but are
    not specific to a single part.<br />\r\nThis document specifies syntax and semantics
    of the data types and tools common to the tools defined in the other parts of
    the ISO/IEC 23005 series, such as basic data types which are used as basic building
    blocks in more than one of the tools in the ISO/IEC 23005 series, colour-related
    basic types which are used in light and colourâ€‘related tools to help in specifying
    colour-related characteristics of the devices or commands, and time stamp types
    which can be used in device commands, and sensed information to specify timing
    related information.<br />\r\nClassification schemes, which provide semantics
    of words or terms and normative way of referencing them, are also defined in Annex
    A, if they are used in more than one part of the ISO/IEC 23005 series.<br />\r\nThe
    tools defined in this document are not intended to be used alone, but to be used
    as a part or as a supporting tool of other tools defined in other parts of the
    ISO/IEC 23005 series, except for the profile and level definitions.<br />\r\nThis
    document also contains standard profiles and levels to be used in specific application
    domains. The profile and level definitions include collection of tools from ISO/IEC
    23005-2 and ISO/IEC 23005-5 with necessary constraints."
