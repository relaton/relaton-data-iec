abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 10118 specifies two hash-functions which make
    use of modular arithmetic. These hash-functions,</p><p>which are believed to be
    collision-resistant, compress messages of arbitrary but limited length to a hash-code</p><p>whose
    length is determined by the length of the prime number used in the reduction-function
    defined in 7.3. Thus,</p><p>the hash-code is easily scaled to the input length
    of any mechanism (e.g., signature algorithm, identification</p><p>scheme).</p><p>The
    hash-functions specified in this part of ISO/IEC 10118, known as MASH-1 and MASH-2
    (Modular Arithmetic</p><p>Secure Hash) are particularly suitable for environments
    in which implementations of modular arithmetic of sufficient</p><p>length are
    already available. The two hash-functions differ only in the exponent used in
    the round-function.</p>"
