    <p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of magnetic tape cassettes, using magnetic tape</p>
    <p>12,65 mm wide so as to provide physical interchange of such cassettes between drives. It also specifies the quality of the</p>
    <p>recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format, called Digital Tape Format-2 (DTF-2), thereby allowing data</p>
    <p>interchange between drives by means of such cassettes. The format supports variable length Logical Records, high-speed</p>
    <p>search, and the use of a registered algorithm for data compression.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies two sizes of cassette. For the purposes of this International Standard the larger cassette is</p>
    <p>referred to as Type L, and the smaller as Type S.</p>
    <p>Together with a standard for volume and file structure, e.g. International Standard ISO 1001, this International Standard</p>
    <p>provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
