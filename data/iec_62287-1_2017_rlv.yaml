abstract:
- content: "IEC 62287-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62287-1:2017
    specifies the minimum operational and performance requirements, methods of testing
    and required test results for Class B shipborne automatic identification system
    (AIS) equipment using carrier-sense time division multiple access (CSTDMA) techniques.
    This document takes into account other associated IEC International Standards
    and existing national standards, as applicable.<br />\r\nIt is applicable for
    AIS equipment used on craft that are not covered by the mandatory carriage requirement
    of AIS under SOLAS Chapter V.<br />\r\nAn AIS station intended to operate in receive-only
    mode is not considered a Class B shipborne mobile AIS station.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical change with respect to the previous
    edition: in the synchronisation method, addition of a direct method for synchronisation
    from an internal UTC source."
