    <p>This International Standard can be used with benefits on all kinds of platform.</p>
    <p>This International Standard's most immediate interest is for deploying portable applications</p>
    <p>on small footprint devices. This International Standard provides dramatic savings of</p>
    <p>dynamic memory and execution time without sacrificing any of the flexibility usually attached</p>
    <p>to the use of non-pre-linked portable code.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is especially important to provide a complete solution to execute</p>
    <p>portable programs of which code size is bigger than the available dynamic memory.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is also very important when fast reactivity of programs is</p>
    <p>important. By avoiding the extra-processing related to loading into dynamic memory and</p>
    <p>formatting classes at runtime, this International Standard provides a complete answer to the</p>
    <p>problem of class-loading slow-down.</p>
    <p>These benefits are particularly interesting for small devices supporting financial applications.</p>
    <p>Such applications are often complex and relying on code of significant size, while the</p>
    <p>pressure of the market often imposes to these devices to be of a low price and,</p>
    <p>consequently, to be very small footprint platforms. In addition, to not impose unacceptable</p>
    <p>delays to customers, it is important these applications do not waste time in loading classes</p>
    <p>into dynamic memory when they are launched but, on the contrary, to be immediately</p>
    <p>actively processing the transaction with no delay. When using smart cards, there are also</p>
    <p>some loose real-time constraints that are better handled if it can be granted that no</p>
    <p>temporary freezing of processing can occur due to class loading.</p>
    <p>This International Standard can also be of great benefit for devices dealing with real-time</p>
    <p>applications. In this case, avoiding the delays due to class loading can play an important</p>
    <p>role to satisfy real-time constraints.</p>
