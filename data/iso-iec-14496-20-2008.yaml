    <p>ISO/IEC 14496-20:2008 defines a scene description format (LASeR) and an aggregation format (SAF) respectively suitable for representing and delivering rich-media services to resource-constrained devices such as mobile phones.</p>
    <p>LASeR aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the scene description level. LASeR supports:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>an optimized set of objects inherited from SVG to describe rich-media scenes,</li>
    <li>a small set of key compatible extensions over SVG, </li>
    <li>the ability to encode and transmit a LASeR stream and then reconstruct SVG content,</li>
    <li>dynamic updating of the scene to achieve a reactive, smooth and continuous service,</li>
    <li>simple yet efficient compression to improve delivery and parsing times, as well as storage size, one of the design goals being to allow both for a direct implementation of the SDL as documented, as well as for a decoder compliant with ISO/IEC 23001-1 to decode the LASeR bitstream,</li>
    <li>an efficient interface with audio and visual streams with frame-accurate synchronization,</li>
    <li>use of any font format, including the OpenType industry standard, and</li>
    <li>easy conversion from other popular rich-media formats in order to leverage existing content and developer communities. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Technology selection criteria for LASeR included compression efficiency, but also code and memory footprint and performance. Other aims included: scalability, adaptability to the user context, extensibility of the format, ability to define small profiles, feasibility of a J2ME implementation, error resilience and safety of implementations. </p>
    <p>SAF aims at fulfilling all the requirements of rich-media services at the interface between media/scene description and existing transport protocols: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>simple aggregation of any type of stream, </li>
    <li>signaling of MPEG and non-MPEG streams, </li>
    <li>optimized packet headers for bandwidth-limited networks, </li>
    <li>easy mapping to popular streaming formats,</li>
    <li>cache management capability, and</li>
    <li>extensibility. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>SAF has been designed to complement LASeR for simple, interactive services, bringing:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>efficient and dynamic packaging to cope with high latency networks,</li>
    <li>media interleaving, and</li>
    <li>synchronization support with a very low overhead.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 14496-20:2008 defines the usage of SAF for LASeR content; however, LASeR can be used independently from SAF.</p>
