  content: "IEC 603352-48:2021+A1:2025 deals with the safety of electrically operated
    commercial grillers and toasters , their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase appliances connected between one phase and neutral, and 480
    V for other appliances.<br />\r\nRotary or continuous grillers or toasters and
    similar appliances intended for grilling by radiant heat such as rotisseries,
    salamanders, etc., are within the scope of this standard. These appliances are
    not intended for household and similar purposes. They are used for commercial
    processing of food, also in areas open to the public, for example in kitchens
    of restaurants, canteens, hospitals and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries
    and butcheries. The electrical part of appliances making use of other forms of
    energy is also within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by these types of appliances.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities;<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used outdoors, additional requirements can
    be necessary.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances
    designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to
    be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of
    a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– appliances
    for continuous mass production of food;<br />\r\n– commercial electric griddles
    and griddle grills (IEC 60335-2-38);<br />\r\n– battery-operated appliances;<br
    />\r\n– grills, toasters and similar portable cooking appliances for household
    use covered by IEC 60335-2-9 and used in the following environments by laymen:
    staff kitchen areas in shops, offices and other working environments, farm houses,
    hotels, motels and other residential type environments, bed and breakfast type
    environments.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition
    published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has
    been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been converted
    to normative text, modified or deleted (Clause 1, 7.15, 9.101, 11.7, 22.101, 23.3,
    27.2, 30.101);<br />\r\nc) clarifications to some test specifications have been
    made (7.101, 11.4, 15.1.1, 19, 20.1, 25.3);<br />\r\nd) introduction of requirements
    for appliances intended for use in areas open to the public, including external
    accessible surface temperatures (Clause 1, 7.12, 11.8, Table 102);<br />\r\ne)
    clarification of applicable standard for appliances for use by laymen (Clause
    1, 7.12);<br />\r\nf) exclusion of battery-operated appliances;<br />\r\ng) relocation
    of cleaning instructions from 7.12.1 to 7.12;<br />\r\nh) relocation of 24.101
    to 22.104;<br />\r\ni) additional instructional requirements in 7.12;<br />\r\nj)
    conciliation of the text of IEC 60335-2-48 with other standards under IEC/TC61/MT32.<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the
    latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis
    of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
