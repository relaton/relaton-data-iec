abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 26555:2015 deals with the tools and methods of technical management
    for software products, software services, software-intensive systems (including
    System Architecture and excluding hardware) within a product line. The scope of
    this International Standard is as follows:</p><p>? Enable the users of this standard
    to holistically understand, adopt, and enact the processes, tools, and methods
    for product line technical management. In addition, this International Standard
    helps the users evaluate and select relevant tools and methods based on business
    and user-related criteria.</p><p>? Help product line engineers, developers, and
    tool vendors become informed about capabilities of tools and methods that are
    required for supporting product line implementation from technical aspects.</p><p>?
    Provide product line-specific processes and capabilities of tools and methods
    in technical management.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26555:2015 does not concern processes and
    capabilities of tools and methods for technical management for a one-of-a-kind
    system but rather deals with those belonging to a family of systems.</p><p>NOTE:
    System Architecture is a set of logical and physical principles used to achieve
    a mission within a given environment. From System Architecture are derived components
    that can be subsystems, software products, human-based products like crew or operators
    or hardware product like mechanical structures, electronic boards, chemicals,
    etc. The scope of the International Standard spans from the system, to sub-systems,
    and software products. Other types of components and especially those related
    to human beings and to hardware parts are not within the scope of this International
    Standard.</p>"
