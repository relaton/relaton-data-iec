  content: "IEC TR 60878:2022 provides a compilation, for easy reference, of graphical
    symbols (graphics, title, description) and safety signs for medical electrical
    equipment. The graphical symbols are grouped in sections according to their specific
    field of application (see Clause 4).<br />\r\nIEC TR 60878:2022 cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2015. This fourth edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThe main changes compared with IEC TR 60878:2015 are as follows:<br
    />\r\n• A total of 109 new symbols and safety signs that have been identified
    since the publication of the third edition have been added. For identification,
    the number of the new symbol or safety sign is printed in red followed by “New”.<br
    />\r\n• Of the symbols and safety signs in the third edition, 14 have changes
    in their title or description. For identification, the number of a modified symbol
    or safety sign is printed in red followed by “Mod”.<br />\r\nThe contents of the
    corrigendum of February 2023 have been included in this copy."
