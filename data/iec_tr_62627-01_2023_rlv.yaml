abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62627-01:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 62627-01:2023
    which is a Technical Report, details cleaning methods for fibre optic connectors.
    It includes typical cleaning tools and machines, and cleaning procedures. Other
    cleaning methods exist. The impact of contamination and the reasons for connector
    visual inspection and cleaning are described in Annex B. This document does not
    address the visual inspection procedures, which are covered in IEC 61300-3-35.
    Optical fibre patch cords are handled by the operators and maintenance staff of
    optical network systems. This document is useful as a guideline to prepare instruction
    manuals for those involved in optical system maintenance and operation. This document
    covers fibre optic connector plugs, optical adaptors, optical receptacles (excluding
    optical transceivers) and dust caps. Guidelines for fibre optic connector end-face
    cleaning methods for receptacle style optical transceivers are covered in IEC
    TR 62572-4. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- addition of cleaning tools for adhesive pad type and adhesive pen type
    in terms and definitions (Clause 3), in information (7.5 and 7.6), in fibre optic
    connectors and their applicable cleaning tools (Table 1 and Clause 8) and procedures
    (9.5, 9.6 and 9.7);<br />\r\n- addition of classification of cleaning tools and
    machines (Figure 1)."
