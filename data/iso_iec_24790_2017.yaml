abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24790:2017 specifies device-independent image quality attributes,
    measurement methods and analytical procedures to describe the quality of output
    images from hardcopy devices. This document is applicable to human-readable monochrome
    documents produced from printers and copiers.</p><p>The attributes, methods and
    procedures rely on measurable properties of printed text and graphic images. Special
    targets or reference images are not required, but image elements are useful for
    adequate measurements only if they meet some minimal requirements, e.g. on size
    or number present. This document is not applicable to images on media other than
    hardcopy (e.g. images on a visual display) or to images that are intended to be
    machine readable only (e.g. bar codes).</p>"
