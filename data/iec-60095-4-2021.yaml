  content: IEC 60095-4:2021 is applicable to lead-acid batteries used for starting,
    lighting and ignition of heavy trucks, commercial vehicles, busses and agricultural
    trucks. The object of this document is to specify global requirements of the main
    dimensions of starter batteries for Europe, North America and East Asia. This
    document comprises 12 types of "preferred types" of batteries. This document specifies
    dimensions of 4 types of batteries each for Europe (types A, B, C and D2), North
    America (types 4D, 8D, 31T, 31A) and East Asia (types E41, F51, G51, H52).
