    <p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a case for use with 120 mm DVD-RAM disks as specified in</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 16824. This International Standard specifies three related, but different implementations of such cases, viz.</p>
    <p><b>Type 1 </b>Provides a case for a one-sided (Type 1S) or a two-sided (Type 2S) DVD-RAM disk such that the disk can</p>
    <p>not be removed from the case. This case is reversible.</p>
    <p><b>Type 2 </b>Provides a case for a one-sided DVD-RAM disk (Type 1S) such that the disk may be removed from the</p>
    <p>case. This case is not reversible.</p>
    <p><b>Type 3 </b>Provides a case into which a one-sided DVD-RAM disk (Type 1S) may be inserted, then used as a</p>
    <p>cartridge. This case is not reversible.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>-  the environments in which the cases are to be operated and stored;</p>
    <p>-  the dimensional and mechanical characteristics of the case, so as to provide mechanical interchangeability between data</p>
    <p>processing systems;</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for mechanical interchange between optical disk drives. Together with 120 mm</p>
    <p>DVD-RAM disks according to ISO/IEC 16824 and a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data</p>
    <p>interchange between data processing systems.</p>
