    for several functions. These machines are intended for placing on counters, tables,
    work tops or sinks, for built-in, or for hand-held use, supplied from mains or
    from batteries and able to ensure the functions described in IEC 60619:1993, Clause
    4 and IEC 60619:1993/AMD1:1995, Clause 4.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 1998. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) definition of various kind of
    food preparation appliances added;<br />\r\nb) revision of the test conditions;<br
    />\r\nc) coffee mills and coffee grinders are removed from the scope.<br />\r\nThis
    Part 2-11 is intended to be used in conjunction with the fourth edition of IEC

    determination of airborne acoustical noise - Part 1: General requirements."
