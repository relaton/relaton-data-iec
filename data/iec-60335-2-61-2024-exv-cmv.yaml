  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-61:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-61:2024 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-61:2024 deals with the safety of electric thermal-storage
    room heaters for household and similar purposes that are intended to heat the
    room in which they are located, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V
    for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances. Appliances not intended for normal household use but
    which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are
    within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n-
    this standard only applies to self-contained thermal-storage room heaters. However,
    it can be used as a guide, in so far as it reasonably applies, to determine the
    requirements and test specifications for other thermal-storage room heaters;<br
    />\r\n- for heaters incorporating direct-acting heating elements, IEC 60335-2-30
    is also applicable;<br />\r\n- for heaters intended to be used in vehicles or
    on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour
    and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- heaters incorporated
    in the building structure;<br />\r\n- central heating systems;<br />\r\n- heaters
    for saunas (IEC 60335-2-53);<br />\r\n- flexible sheet heating elements for room
    heating (IEC 60335-2-96);<br />\r\n- heaters intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2005 and Amendment 2:2008. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion or conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1, 10.1, 19.3.102, 24.101);<br />\r\nc) application
    of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nd) temperature limits
    have been updated and requirements for measurement were defined (Clause 11.3,
    11.8, Table 101);<br />\r\ne) implementation of Figure 101 with the probe for
    measuring surface temperatures.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
