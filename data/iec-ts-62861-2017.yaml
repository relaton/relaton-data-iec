  content: "IEC TS 62861:2017(E) This Technical Specification provides guidelines
    for establishing confidence in product reliability using principal component testing
    for LED light sources and LED luminaires for general lighting. It includes methods
    and criteria using initial qualification tests and accelerated stress tests of
    the principal components. The performance of any principal component will influence
    the performance of the final product.<br />\r\nTechniques to validate full lifetime
    claims and lumen maintenance projection are outside the scope of this Technical
    Specification. The following principal components are included in the testing
    if they are used as an integral part for the LED light source or LED luminaire:<br
    />\r\n- LED package and interconnects;<br />\r\n- optical materials;<br />\r\n-
    electronic subassemblies;<br />\r\n- cooling systems, both active (e.g. fans)
    and passive (e.g. thermal interface material);<br />\r\n- construction materials.<br
    />\r\nThis Technical Specification is not recommended for use as a normative reference
    to the LED product performance standards."
