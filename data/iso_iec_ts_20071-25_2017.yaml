abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 provides recommendations on the audio presentation
    of captions/subtitles and other on-screen text for use in all type of videos regardless
    of the language and technology being used to transmit and present the recorded
    or live video.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 applies to making captions/subtitles
    and other on-screen text accessible to users with various needs, including but
    not limited to people with learning and reading disabilities, people with cognitive
    disabilities, people who are blind or have low vision, older people, and non-native
    language speakers. It does not apply to captions/subtitles or other on-screen
    text whose content is already provided in the soundtrack in a language and a way
    users can access.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 20071-25:2017 provides guidance on spoken
    captions/subtitles as a stand-alone access service but it also provides guidance
    on how to integrate spoken captions/subtitles, other spoken on-screen text and
    audio description, if needed, in different types of videos.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Extensive
    guidance on audio description is provided in ISO/IEC/TS 20071â€‘21.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 20071-25:2017 does not consider the devices or transmission mechanisms used
    to deliver and play the content or the audio presentation of text in videos. These
    devices include, but are not limited to televisions, computers, wireless devices,
    projection equipment, DVD and home cinema equipment, cinema equipment and other
    forms of user interfaces technology. Therefore, this document does not consider
    transcoding files for the various video and audio outputs.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Technical
    matters of transmission and distribution are covered by other documents (e.g.
    MPEG standards and other technical standards such as IEC 62731:2013).<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 20071-25:2017 acknowledges the various needs and preferences of users, as well
    as the different approaches to the audio presentation of text in videos.<br />\r\nIt
    applies to audio presentations intended to be heard simultaneously along with
    the original video."
