  content: IEC/PAS 62816-1:2013(E) specifies the safety requirements for tubular type
    external electrode fluorescent lamps for backlight unit purposes used in flat
    panel displays such as TVs and monitors etc., hereafter called "lamps". This PAS
    will be revised to include other types of lamp when a need for them is recognized.
    It also specifies the method a manufacturer needs to use to show compliance with
    the requirements of this PAS on the basis of whole production appraisal in association
    with test records on finished products. Details of a batch test procedure, which
    can be used to make limited assessment of batches are also given in this PAS.
