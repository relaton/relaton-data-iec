abstract:
- content: "IEC 62873-3-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62873-3-1:2020
    applies to devices equipped with screwless-type terminals for current not exceeding
    40 A, primarily suitable for connecting unprepared copper conductors of crossâ€‘section
    up to 10 mm2. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- Modification of scope to cover screwless-type terminals up to 40 A;<br
    />\r\n- Modification of scope to address other devices in addition to RCDs;<br
    />\r\n- Modification of Table 1 to cover rated currents up to 40 A;<br />\r\n-
    Modification of 8.1 so that IEC 62873-3-1 can be referred to by other product
    standards in addition to those for RCDs;<br />\r\n- Modification of 9.1 so that
    IEC 62873-3-1 can be referred to by other product standards in addition to those
    for RCDs."
