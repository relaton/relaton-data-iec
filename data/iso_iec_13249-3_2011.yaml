abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 13249-3:2011 defines spatial user-defined types, routines and
    schemas for generic spatial data handling. It addresses the need to store, manage
    and retrieve information based on aspects of spatial data such as geometry, location
    and topology.<br /><br />\r\nImplementations of ISO/IEC 13249-3:2011 may exist
    in environments that also support geographic information, decision support, data
    mining, and data warehousing systems. Application areas addressed by implementations
    of ISO/IEC 13249-3:2011 include, but are not restricted to, automated mapping,
    desktop mapping, facilities management, geoengineering, graphics, location-based
    services, terrain modelling, multimedia, and resource management applications."
