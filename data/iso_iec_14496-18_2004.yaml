abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-18:2004 is part of the MPEG-4 suite of International Standards.
    It specifies font data representation, compression and streaming, providing an
    efficient mechanism to embed font data in MPEG-4 encoded presentations. It also
    defines MPEG-4 Text profiles and levels.<br /><br />\r\nThe ISO/IEC 14496 (MPEG-4)
    series has been developed by MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) and defines the
    set of technologies for compression, encoding and delivery of complex audio-visual
    scenes composed of different media objects:\r\n\r\n\tvideo objects (natural or
    synthetic video);\r\n\taudio objects;\r\n\tstill images;\r\n\ttext and vector
    graphics;\r\n\tcomputer-animated images.<br /><br />\r\nMPEG-4 provides a standardized
    way to:\r\n\r\n\trepresent the content of audio-visual objects;\r\n\tdescribe
    the composition of these objects in compound media scenes;\r\n\tencode, multiplex
    and synchronize the data associated with the media objects;\r\n\ttransport the
    media presentation over different channels;\r\n\tinteract with the audio-visual
    scene at the receiver's end.<br /><br />\r\nAn essential part of almost any media
    presentation involves text objects that are created using specific or custom fonts.
    Font selection determines the appearance of text in multimedia content and also
    plays a critical role in the overall scene composition, since the metric properties
    of a font are used for textual parts of multimedia content layout. Many thousands
    of fonts are available today for use in content creation. In order to assure the
    readability and legibility of text as well as the correct appearance and layout
    of content, the font data must be included (embedded) with the text objects as
    part of the multimedia presentation."
