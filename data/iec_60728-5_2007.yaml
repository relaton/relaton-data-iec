abstract:
- content: 'It defines the characteristics of equipment used in the headends of terrestrial
    broadcast and satellite receiving systems (without satellite outdoor units and
    without those broadband amplifiers in the headend as described in IEC 60728-3).
    The satellite outdoor units for FSS are described in ETSI ETS 300 158, for BSS
    in ETSI ETS 300 249. Test methods for both types (FSS and BSS) of satellite outdoor
    units are laid down in ETSI ETS 300 457. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: Revised title and scope
    Clause 3, several new terms and definitions Subclause 4.1, Methods of measurement
    for digitally modulated signals Subclause 4.6.2, RF signal-to-noise ratio (SD,RF/N)
    for digitally modulated signals Subclause 4.8.2, Procedure for the measurement
    of group delay variation on DVB channel converters Subclause 4.9, Phase noise
    of an RF carrier Subclause 4.15, Decoding margin (Teletext). Annex D, Special
    national conditions. Annex E, Correction factors for noise. Annex F, Digital signal
    level and bandwidth. Annex G, Minimum frequency distance of converted satellite
    signals in the IF range. Annex H, Measurement errors which occur due to mismatched
    equipment..Annex I, Correction factor for spectrum analyser'
