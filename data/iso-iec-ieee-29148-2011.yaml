  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 contains provisions for the processes and products
    related to the engineering of requirements for systems and software products and
    services throughout the life cycle. It defines the construct of a good requirement,
    provides attributes and characteristics of requirements, and discusses the iterative
    and recursive application of requirements processes throughout the life cycle.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011 provides additional guidance in the application of requirements
    engineering and management processes for requirements-related activities in ISO/IEC
    12207:2008 and ISO/IEC 15288:2008. Information items applicable to the engineering
    of requirements and their content are defined. The content of ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2011
    \ can be added to the existing set of requirements-related life cycle processes
    defined by ISO/IEC 12207:2008 or ISO/IEC 15288:2008, or can be used independently.</p>"
