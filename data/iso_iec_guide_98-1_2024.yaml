abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC GUIDE 98-1:2024 This document establishes general rules for evaluating
    and expressing uncertainty in measurement from the shop floor to fundamental research.
    Therefore, the principles of this suite of documents are intended to be applicable
    to a broad spectrum of measurements and their applications. An overview of the
    parts of the GUM is given in table A.1 in Annex A. NOTE Where the acronym GUM
    is used in this document, it refers to the suite of documents. An individual part
    of the GUM is referred to by its corresponding JCGM numbering (e.g., part 6 of
    the GUM is JCGM GUM-6:2020). This document gives a rationale for evaluating, expressing
    and using measurement uncertainty (Clause 2). A brief introduction is given to
    measurement (Clause 3) and to the decisions involved when evaluating measurement
    uncertainty (Clause 4). In Clause 5, a brief description of the contents of the
    parts of the GUM is given. In each of these clauses, the relevant parts of the
    GUM are identified for further guidance.
