abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29500-4:2016 defines a set of XML vocabularies for representing word-processing
    documents, spreadsheets and presentations. On the one hand, the goal of ISO/IEC
    29500 is to represent faithfully the existing corpus of word-processing documents,
    spreadsheets and presentations that have been produced by Microsoft Office applications
    (from Microsoft Office 97 to Microsoft Office 2008, inclusive). It also specifies
    requirements for Office Open XML consumers and producers. On the other hand, the
    goal is to facilitate extensibility and interoperability by enabling implementations
    by multiple vendors and on multiple platforms.<p>ISO/IEC 29500-4:2016 defines
    features for backward-compatibility and that are useful for high-quality migration
    of existing binary documents to ISO/IEC 29500. These features are used only by
    documents of conformance class WML Transitional (ยง2.1), SML Transitional (ยง2.1),
    or PML Transitional (ยง2.1). These features are sometimes needed for high-quality
    migration of existing binary documents to ISO/IEC 29500.</p>"
