  content: "IEC 62899-301-3:2024 defines measurement terms and methods related to
    the shape errors of printing plate rollers. Measurement terms include radius,
    total run-out, and three kinds of shape errors of printing plate rollers that
    are axial deviation, radial deviation, and cross-sectional deviation. The remaining
    shape error excluding the three errors mentioned above is defined as a residual
    shape error.<br />\r\nThis document applies to printing plate rollers with or
    without patterns while excluding the pattern area for the measurement."
