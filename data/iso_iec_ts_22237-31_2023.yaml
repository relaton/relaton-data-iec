- content: "ISO/IEC TS 22237-31:2023 This document:<br />\r\na) defines metrics as
    key performance indicators (KPIs) for resilience, dependability, fault tolerance
    and availability tolerance for data centres;<br />\r\nb) covers the data centre
    infrastructure (DCI) of power distribution and supply, and environmental control;<br
    />\r\nc) can be referred to for covering further infrastructures, e.g. telecommunications
    cabling;<br />\r\nd) defines the measurement and calculation of the KPIs and resilience
    levels (RLs);<br />\r\ne) targets maintainability, recoverability and vulnerability;<br
    />\r\nf) provides examples for calculating these KPIs for the purpose of analytical
    comparison of different DCIs.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to IT equipment,
    cloud services, software or business applications."
