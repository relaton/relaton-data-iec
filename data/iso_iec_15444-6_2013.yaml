abstract:
- content: "<p>This Recommendation | International Standard defines a normative but
    optional file format for storing compound images using the JPEG 2000 file format
    family architecture. This format is an extension of the JP2 file format defined
    in Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 Annex I and uses boxes defined for both
    the JP2 file format and the JPX file format defined in Rec. ITU-T T.801 | ISO/IEC
    15444-2 Annex M. This Recommendation | International Standard is useful for applications
    storing multiple pages, images with mixed content, and/or images that need more
    structure than provided in JP2.</p><p>Applications that implement this file format
    shall implement it as described in this Recommendation | International</p><p>Standard.
    This Recommendation | International Standard:</p><p>? specifies a binary container
    for multiple bi-level and continuous-tone images used to represent a</p><p> compound
    image;</p><p>? specifies a mechanism by which multiple images can be combined
    into a single compound image, based</p><p> on the mixed raster content (MRC) model;</p><p>?
    specifies a mechanism for grouping multiple images in a hierarchy of layout objects,
    pages and page</p><p> collections;</p><p>? specifies a mechanism for storing JPEG
    2000 and other compressed image data formats;</p><p>? specifies a mechanism by
    which metadata can be included in files specified by this Recommendation |</p><p>
    International Standard.</p>"
