    <p>This document:</p>
    <p>—     provides risk management elaborations for the processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207,</p>
    <p>—     provides the users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 and their associated elaboration standards with common terminology and specialized guidance for performing risk management within the context of systems and software engineering projects,</p>
    <p>—     specifies the required information items that are to be produced through the implementation of risk management process for claiming conformance, and</p>
    <p>—     specifies the required contents of the information items.</p>
    <p>This document provides a universally applicable standard for practitioners responsible for managing risks associated with systems and software over their life cycle. This document is suitable for the management of all risks encountered in any organization or project appropriate to the systems or software projects regardless of context, type of industry, technologies utilized, or organizational structures involved.</p>
    <p>This document does not provide detailed information about risk management practices, techniques, or tools which are widely available in other publications. Instead this document focuses on providing a comprehensive reference for integrating the large and wide variety of processes, practices, techniques, and tools encountered in systems and software engineering projects and other lifecycle activities into a unified approach for risk management, with the purpose of providing effective and efficient risk management while meeting the expectations and requirements of organization and project stakeholders.</p>
