abstract:
- content: Active antennas used on board vehicles are electronic components in the
    sense of CISPR 25. Therefore, the requirements regarding emissions apply to it
    in its function as EUT. In addition to this, vehicle active antennas are used
    as part of the measurement chain for the evaluation of emissions produced by any
    other component in the vehicle. With a passive antenna no special considerations
    were necessary because it can neither generate emissions nor harmonics due to
    its linearity. This Publicly Available Specification (PAS) gives additional information
    for the use of active antennas for radiated emission measurement according to
    CISPR 25. Test set-ups at component level are defined for the determination of
    noise floor.
