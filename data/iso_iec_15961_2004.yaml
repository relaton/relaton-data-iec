abstract:
- content: "The data protocol used to exchange information in a radio-frequency identification
    (RFID) system for item management is specified in ISO/IEC 15961:2004 and in ISO/IEC
    15962:2004. Both are required for a complete understanding of the data protocol
    in its entirety; but each focuses on one particular interface:\r\n\r\n\tISO/IEC
    15961:2004 addresses the information interface with the application system.\r\n\tISO/IEC
    15962:2004 deals with the processing of data and its presentation to the RF tag,
    and the initial processing of data captured from the RF tag.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15961:2004 focuses on the interface between the application and the data protocol
    processor, and includes the specification of the transfer syntax and definition
    of application commands and responses. It allows data and commands to be specified
    in a standardized way, independent of the particular air interface of ISO/IEC
    18000.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15961:2004\r\n\r\n\tprovides guidelines on how data
    shall be presented as objects;\r\n\tdefines the structure of object identifiers,
    based on ISO/IEC 9834-1;\r\n\tspecifies the commands that are supported for transferring
    data between the application and the RF tag;\r\n\tspecifies the responses that
    are supported for transferring data between the RF tag and the application;\r\n\tprovides
    a formal description of all the processes using ASN.1, as specified in ISO/IEC
    8824-1;\r\n\tspecifies the transfer syntax, based on the Basic Encoding Rules
    of ISO/IEC 8825-1, for data to be transferred from and to the application.<br
    /><br />\r\nIt is expected that ISO/IEC 15961:2004 will be used as a reference
    to develop software appropriate for particular applications, or for particular
    RF equipment."
