    <p>ISO/IEC 15149:2011 specifies the physical layer and media access control layer protocols of a wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency band (~300 kHz), for wireless communication in harsh environments (i.e. around metal, underwater, underground, etc.). </p>
    <p>The physical layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>low carrier frequency for large magnetic field area and reliable communication in harsh environments;</li>
    <li>simple and robust modulation for a low implementation cost and error performance;</li>
    <li>variable coding and bandwidth for a link adaptation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The media access control layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>simple and efficient network topology for low power consumption;</li>
    <li>variable superframe structure for compact and efficient data transmission;</li>
    <li>dynamic address assignment for small packet size and efficient address management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15149:2011 supports several kbps data transmission in a wireless network within a distance of several metres. It can be applied to various services such as the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>in the environmental industry, to manage pollution levels in soil and water using wireless underground or underwater sensors; </li>
    <li>in the construction industry, to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using wireless, inner-corrosion sensors;</li>
    <li>in the consumer-electronics industry, to detect food spoilage in wet, airtight storage areas and to transfer the sensing data from the inside to the outside;</li>
    <li>in the agricultural industry, to manage the moisture level as well as mineral status in soil using buried wireless sensors;</li>
    <li>in the transportation industry, to manage road conditions and traffic information using wireless underground sensors.</li>
    </ul>
