abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30136:2018 supports evaluation of the accuracy, secrecy, and privacy
    of biometric template protection schemes. It establishes definitions, terminology,
    and metrics for stating the performance of such schemes. Particularly, this document
    establishes requirements for the measurement and reporting of:<br />\r\n- theoretical
    and empirical accuracy of biometric template protection schemes,<br />\r\n- theoretical
    and empirical probability of a successful attack on biometric template protection
    schemes (single or multiple), and<br />\r\n- the information leaked about the
    original biometric when one or more biometric template protection schemes are
    compromised.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 30136:2018 also gives guidance on measuring and
    reporting diversity and unlinkability of templates.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 30136:2018
    does not:<br />\r\n- establish template protection schemes;<br />\r\n- address
    testing of traditional encryption schemes."
