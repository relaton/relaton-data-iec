  content: "IEC 60684-3-216:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-216:
    2019 gives the requirements for four types of heat-shrinkable, flame-retarded,
    limited-fire-hazard sleeving with a thermal endurance rating of 105 °C as shown
    below.<br />\r\nClass A: thin wall shrink ratio 2:1 internal diameter up to 102,0
    mm<br />\r\nClass B: medium wall shrink ratio 2:1 internal diameter up to 60,0
    mm<br />\r\nClass C: thick wall shrink ratio 2:1 internal diameter up to 51,0
    mm<br />\r\nClass D: medium wall shrink ratio 3:1 internal diameter up to 40,0
    mm<br />\r\nThese sleevings are normally supplied in the following colours: black,
    red, green, blue, white, yellow and green/yellow. Sizes or colours other than
    those listed in this document are available as custom items. These items are considered
    to comply with this document if they comply with the property requirements listed
    in Tables 5, 6, 7 and 8, excluding dimensions and mass. Materials which conform
    to this specification meet established levels of performance. However, the selection
    of a material by a user for a specific application will be based on the actual
    requirements necessary for adequate performance in that application and not based
    on this specification alone. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2001, Amendment 1:2005 and Amendment 2:2013. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n1. the temperature
    at which the sleeving is shrunk in a forced-air circulation oven for (5 ± 1) min
    has been increased from (150 ± 5) °C to (200 ± 5) °C.<br />\r\nKeywords: flexible
    insulating sleeving for electrical purposes"
