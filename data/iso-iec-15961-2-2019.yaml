    <p>This document specifies the procedural requirements to maintain specific RFID data constructs. The data constructs are associated with managing open and closed applications that utilise RFID systems which conform to the data protocol defined in other parts of ISO/IEC 15961 and ISO/IEC 15962, and the air interface protocols of ISO/IEC 18000.</p>
    <p>It also outlines the obligations of the Registration Authority and the application administrators, with respect to:</p>
    <p>—          the allocation of AFIs to particular applications defined by the application administrator;</p>
    <p>—          the allocation of data formats to particular applications defined by the application administrator;</p>
    <p>—          the registration of Root-OIDs, compliant with ISO/IEC 9834-1, to any Unique Item Identifiers used in applications defined by the application administrator;</p>
    <p>—          the registration of Root-OIDs, compliant with ISO/IEC 9834-1, to any other data used in applications defined by the application administrator;</p>
    <p>—          the registration of various table-driven encoding schemes, compliant with ISO/IEC 15962.</p>
