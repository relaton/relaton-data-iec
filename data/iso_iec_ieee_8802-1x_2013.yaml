abstract:
- content: "<p>Port-based network access control allows a network administrator to
    restrict the use of IEEE 802 local area network (LAN) service access points (ports)
    to secure communication between authenticated and authorized devices. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    8802-1X:2013 specifies a common architecture, functional elements, and protocols
    that support mutual authentication between the clients of ports attached to the
    same LAN and that secure communication between the ports, including the media
    access method independent protocols that are used to discover and establish the
    security associations used by ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802.1AE MAC Security.</p>"
