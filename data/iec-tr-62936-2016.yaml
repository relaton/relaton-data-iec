  content: IEC TR 62936:2016(E) provides guidelines for the selection of substances
    for the development of test method standards. The substances and substance groups
    listed in the IEC 62474 database are the primary source of candidate substances.
    Other substances that are under regulatory roadmap and market requirements can
    also be considered for this filtering and selection process.
