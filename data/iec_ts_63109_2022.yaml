abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63109:2022 specifies a method to measure the diode ideality factor
    of photovoltaic cells and modules by quantitative analysis of electroluminescence
    (EL) images. This document provides a definition of the term diode ideality factor<em>n</em>,
    as the inverse of increment ratio of natural logarithm of current as a function
    of applied voltage, which is related to the fill factor<em>FF</em>, and is useful
    as an effective indicator to represent the output efficiency of photovoltaic cells
    and modules with the other key parameters open circuit voltage<em>V</em>oc and
    short circuit current<em>I</em>sc.
