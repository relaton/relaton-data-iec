abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61292-8:2019, which is a technical report, deals with high-power
    optical amplifiers. It provides general information relating to high-power optical
    amplifiers with an output power greater than 500 mW for the fibre communication
    field. It covers the following aspects:<br />\r\n- general information;<br />\r\n-
    example of the optical amplifier's configuration realizing high optical output
    power;<br />\r\n- test method for optical output power and gain;<br />\r\n- considerations
    on high-power optical amplifiers.<br />\r\nPotential applications of high-power
    optical amplifiers are briefly reviewed in Annex A.<br />\r\nInformative IEC documents
    related to high optical power are listed in Annex B.<br />\r\nKeywords: high-power
    amplifiers"
