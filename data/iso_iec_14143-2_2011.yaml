abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14143-2:2011:establishes a framework for the conformity evaluation
    of a Candidate FSM Method against the provisions of ISO/IEC 14143-1;describes
    a process for conformity evaluation of whether a Candidate FSM Method meets the
    (type) requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1 such that it is an actual FSM method, i.e.
    they are of the same type;describes the requirements for performing a conformity
    evaluation in order to ensure repeatability of the conformity evaluation process,
    as well as consistency of decisions on conformity and the final result;aims to
    ensure that the output from the conformity evaluation process is objective, impartial,
    consistent, repeatable, complete and auditable;provides informative guidelines
    for determining the competence of the conformity evaluation teams;provides an
    example checklist to assist in the conformity evaluation of a Candidate FSM Method;
    andprovides an example template for the conformity evaluation report.
