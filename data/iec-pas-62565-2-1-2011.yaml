  content: IEC/PAS 62565-2-1:2011(E) establishes a blank detail specification for
    the essential electrical properties and certain other common characteristics including
    dimensional, structural and mechanical properties of single-wall carbon nanotubes.
    It provides a standardized format for detail specifications characterising essential
    basic properties of single-wall nanotubes and recommends measurement methods.
    Single-wall carbon nanotubes with a chemical modification, dispersed into a solvent
    or grown on a substrate are included. A PAS is a technical specification not fulfilling
    the requirements for a standard, but made available to the public. Following publication
    of this PAS, which is a pre-standard publication, the technical committee concerned
    may transform it into an International Standard.
