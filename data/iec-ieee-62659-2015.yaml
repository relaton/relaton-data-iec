  content: IEC/IEEE 62659:2015(E) provides a framework for introducing nanoelectronics
    into large scale, high volume production in semiconductor manufacturing facilities
    through the incorporation of nanomaterials (e.g. carbon nanotubes, graphene, quantum
    dots, etc.). Since semiconductor manufacturing facilities need to incorporate
    practices that maintain high yields, there are very strict requirements for how
    manufacturing is performed. Nanomaterials represent a potential contaminant in
    semiconductor manufacturing facilities and need to be introduced in a structured
    and methodical way.
