  content: "IEC TS 62443-1-5:2023 specifies a scheme for defining (selecting, writing,
    drafting, creating) IEC 62443 security profiles.<br />\r\nThis scheme and its
    specified requirements apply to IEC 62443 security profiles which are planned
    to be published as part of the upcoming IEC 62443 dedicated security profiles
    sub-series.<br />\r\nIEC 62443 security profiles can support interested parties
    (e.g. during conformity assessment activities) to achieve comparability of assessed
    IEC 62443 requirements."
