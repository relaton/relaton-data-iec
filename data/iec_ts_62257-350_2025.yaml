abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62257-350:2025 specifies the criteria for selecting and sizing inverters
    suitable for different off-grid applications integrating solar as an energy source.
    As well as off-grid systems, this document can also apply to inverters where a
    utility grid connection is available as a backup for charging batteries, but it
    is not intended to cover applications in which inverters synchronize and inject
    energy back into a utility grid, even though this capability can incidentally
    be a part of the functionality of the inverters. Single and multi-phase applications
    are included.
