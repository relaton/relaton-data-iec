abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: "IEC TS 61156-1-2:2023 specifies symmetrical pair/quad electrical transmission
    characteristics and test methods present in IEC 61156-1:2002 (Edition 2) and not
    carried into IEC 61156-1:2007 (Edition 3). It details characteristic impedance
    test methods and function fitting procedures, the open/short-circuit method and
    the background of unbalance attenuation measurement.<br />\r\nIt is extended by
    a description of the balunless measurements technique, which is an amendment to
    the former technical report and is improved and incorporated into this new edition.
    The complete document is transferred into a technical specification."
