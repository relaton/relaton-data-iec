abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11179-31:2023 This document provides a specification for an extension
    to a Metadata Registry (MDR), as specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3, in which metadata
    that describes data elements and associated concepts, such as “data element concepts”,
    “conceptual domains” and “value domains” can be registered.<br />\r\nThe specification
    in this document, together with the relevant clauses of the specification in ISO/IEC
    11179-3, provides the ability to record metadata about:<br />\r\na) data elements,
    units of measure and derivation rules;<br />\r\nb) data element concepts and associated
    object classes and properties;<br />\r\nc) conceptual domains, conceptual domain
    subsets and value meanings;<br />\r\nd) value domains, value domain subsets, datatypes
    and permissible values.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to the formulation
    of data representations, concepts, meanings and relationships to be shared among
    people and machines, independent of the organization that produces the data. It
    is not applicable to the physical representation of data as bits and bytes at
    the machine level."
