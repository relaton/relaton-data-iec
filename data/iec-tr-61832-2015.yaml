  content: "IEC TR 61832:2015(E) is intended as a guide to assist in the development
    of a specification or material requisition for analysers and their associated
    support systems. It is intended to be used for enquiry purposes and the subsequent
    assessment of the bids presented by the prospective vendors. The intention is
    to cover the general principles and items that need to be addressed when purchasing
    large analyser systems. \n\n<br /><br />This publication is to be read in conjunction
    with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/5976\">IEC 61831:2011</a>."
