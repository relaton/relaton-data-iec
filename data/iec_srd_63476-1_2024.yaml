abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63476-1:2024 provides a gap analysis on ontology relevant standards
    for smart city systems to be used as a base document for mapping, developing and
    maintaining a set of ontology standards for smart city systems.<br />\r\nOntology
    is becoming a key subject in the world of big data, AI, IoT, and smart city system
    standards. The following benefits of ontology are recognized as important with
    respect to interoperability, connectivity, traceability of digital content, particularly
    machine readability, executability and interpretability of digital content for
    decision making and actions.<br />\r\n- Increase interoperability across domains.<br
    />\r\n- Enable machine-readable code for computational reasoning and decision
    making.<br />\r\n- Create semantic linkages between data, information and knowledge
    systems.<br />\r\n- Build accessible APIs and semantic linkages between web-based
    data objects.<br />\r\n- Link data domains with shared concepts or canonical data
    models.<br />\r\n- Connect shared data concepts and definitions between domains.<br
    />\r\nHowever, ontology has a variety of definitions in different international
    standards. How to understand different meanings of ontology and select the right
    definition for the right stakeholders’ concerns for the right purposes is a big
    challenge for effective integration of business, data, information, knowledge
    and decision making, across disciplines, domains, systems, platforms and applications
    in smart cites. Moreover, how to deal with the grand challenges of interoperability
    of many and various ontologies to satisfy the demands from artificial intelligence
    and big data analytics are gaps to be filled in the area of smart city systems.
    How to develop digital content that is machine readable, executable and interpretable,
    working in the system without human effort for a smart city system are emerging
    needs to be studied. There are significant demands for better communication, coordination,
    cooperation, collaboration and connectivity of existing ontology standards to
    smart cities practical sectors. This document aims:<br />\r\n• to identify existing
    ontology standards from different Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) and
    to provide best practice examples and considerations of ontology standards development
    and maintenance for smart city systems;<br />\r\n• to identify gaps in existing
    ontology standards for smart city systems and the opportunities and challenges
    in ontology standards development taking into account multi-dimensional and muti-domain
    stakeholders’ concerns city wide, and to provide recommendations for ontology
    standards development and maintenance to enable integration, interoperability,
    efficiency and effectiveness of smart city systems."
