  content: IEC TS 61973:2012+A1:2019 applies to the specification and evaluation of
    outdoor audible noise from high voltage direct current (HVDC) substations. It
    is intended to be primarily for the use of the utilities and consultants who are
    responsible for issuing technical specifications for new HVDC projects with and
    evaluating designs proposed by prospective contractors. It is primarily intended
    for HVDC projects with line-commutated converters. Part of this technical specification
    can also be used for the same purpose for HVDC projects using voltage sourced
    converters, and for flexible a.c. transmission systems (FACTS) devices such as
    static Var compensators (SVCs) and static synchronous compensators (STATCOMs).
    <strong>This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2012) and its
    amendment 1 (2019). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
