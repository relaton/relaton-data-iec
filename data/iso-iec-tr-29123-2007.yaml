    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29123:2007 defines a series of requirement and tests used to enhance the interoperability of proximity cards (PICC) and proximity coupling devices (PCD) defined in the ISO/IEC 14443 series and tested in accordance with ISO/IEC 10373-6.</p>
    <p>Conformance to ISO/IEC TR 29123:2007 should increase the chance that the PICCs and PCDs designed to the ISO/IEC 14443 series of standards will be interoperable.</p>
