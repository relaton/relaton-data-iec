abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the mapping functions for a pair of on-demand
    inter-PINX connections using a circuit mode basic service and the supplementary
    service User-to-User Signalling (service 3) of a public ISDN at the same time.<br
    />\r\nIn order to connect a Private Integrated Services Network Exchange (PINX)
    to another PINX, mapping functions are required to adapt the specific interfaces
    at the C reference point to the application at the Q reference point. As such,
    mapping functions provide for physical adaptation to the interface at the C reference
    point. Mapping functions also provide for the mapping of user channels and signalling
    information at the Q reference point to the appropriate channels or timeslots
    at the C reference point.<br />\r\nThe C and Q reference points are defined in
    ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nAt the Q reference point the mappings provide a 64 kbit/s
    service for user channels and a packet mode service for the signalling channel.
    Bearer conditioning is outside the scope of this International Standard, except
    for providing the layer 2 for the signalling channel at the Q reference point.<br
    />\r\nScenario management is outside the scope of this International Standard.<br
    />\r\nThis International Standard is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected
    to form a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN) and which support signalling
    protocols at the Q reference point."
