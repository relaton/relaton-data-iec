abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the mapping functions for a pair
    of on-demand inter-PINX connections using a circuit</p><p>mode basic service and
    the supplementary service User-to-User Signalling (service 3) of a public ISDN
    at the same time.</p><p>In order to connect a Private Integrated Services Network
    Exchange (PINX) to another PINX, mapping functions are required</p><p>to adapt
    the specific interfaces at the C reference point to the application at the Q reference
    point. As such, mapping functions</p><p>provide for physical adaptation to the
    interface at the C reference point. Mapping functions also provide for the mapping
    of</p><p>user channels and signalling information at the Q reference point to
    the appropriate channels or timeslots at the C reference</p><p>point.</p><p>The
    C and Q reference points are defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>At the Q reference
    point the mappings provide a 64 kbit/s service for user channels and a packet
    mode service for the</p><p>signalling channel. Bearer conditioning is outside
    the scope of this International Standard, except for providing the layer 2 for</p><p>the
    signalling channel at the Q reference point.</p><p>Scenario management is outside
    the scope of this International Standard.</p><p>This International Standard is
    applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a Private Integrated Services
    Network</p><p>(PISN) and which support signalling protocols at the Q reference
    point.</p>"
