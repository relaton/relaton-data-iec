abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-41:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-41:2024 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-41:2012
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-41:2024 deals with the safety of electric pumps for liquids
    having a temperature not exceeding 90 Â°C, intended for household and similar purposes,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and
    480 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and
    battery-operated appliances. Examples of appliances within the scope of this standard
    are<br />\r\n- aquarium pumps;<br />\r\n- garden pond pumps;<br />\r\n- shower-boost
    pumps;<br />\r\n- sludge pumps;<br />\r\n- submersible pumps;<br />\r\n- table
    fountain pumps;<br />\r\n- vertical wet pit pumps.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended
    for normal household use, but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by ap-pliances that are
    encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in gen-eral, it does
    not take into account<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authori-ties, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar au-thorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- stationary circulation pumps for heating
    and service water installations (IEC 60335-2-51);<br />\r\n- pumps for flammable
    liquids;<br />\r\n- pumps intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n-
    pumps intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such
    as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- pumps incorporating chlorinators of the electrolytic type.<br />\r\nPumps
    incorporated in appliances are not covered by this standard unless a specific
    ref-erence is made.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) modification
    or conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 7.12.1, 25.7);<br />\r\nc)
    introduction of IEC 60417 symbol for maximum operating depth and indoor use only
    (7.1, 7.6, 7.12.1);<br />\r\nd) clarification of requirements for aquarium pumps
    and garden pond pumps;<br />\r\ne) addition of legibility requirements for markings
    exposed to solar radiation (7.14);<br />\r\nf) clarification of pumps subjected
    to test probe 18 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\ng) introduction of accessible surface
    temperature limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nh) addition of requirements for IEC 61984
    connectors for pumps intended for permanent connection to fixed wiring (22.107,
    24.1.5, 24.1.101, 25.3).<br />\r\ni) clarifications on remote operation for pumps
    in scope of this standard (22.40, 22.49, 22,51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be
    used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
