abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 15443-2:2005 describes a variety of IT security assurance methods
    and approaches and relates them to the IT security assurance framework in ISO/IEC
    TR 15443-1. The emphasis is to identify qualitative properties of the assurance
    methods and elements that contribute to assurance, and where possible, to define
    assurance ratings. This material is intended for IT security professionals for
    the understanding of how to obtain assurance in a given life-cycle stage of a
    product or service.The objective is to describe and categorize assurance methods
    and approaches in a manner enabling a review of their comparable and synergetic
    properties. This will facilitate selection of the appropriate assurance method
    or and possible combination of assurance methods for a given IT security product,
    system, or service and its specific environment.
