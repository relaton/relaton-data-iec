  content: This PAS provides guidelines on generic environmental attributes to be
    considered by product committees when preparing a declaration frame suited to
    a concerned product category to disclose credible, relevant, and harmonized product
    related environmental information to who needs or requests it. As a result, generic
    requirements to be followed by upstream suppliers to deliver necessary information
    to downstream producers are also specified. This PAS is stand-alone and only applicable
    if relevant requirements on environmental aspects and impacts information does
    not exist in relevant product standard.
