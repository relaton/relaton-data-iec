abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 30140-2:2017(E) This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 30140 provides an
    underwater acoustic sensor network (UWASN) conceptual model by identifying and
    defining three domains (application domain, network domain and UWASN domain).
    It also provides multiple reference architecture views consistent with the requirements
    defined in ISO&#x2F;IEC 30140-1 (systems reference architecture, communication
    reference architecture and information reference architecture). For each view,
    related physical and functional entities are described.
