abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62720:2017(E) specifies identifiers for units to support computer-based
    processing of product data. It provides a survey of quantities with associated
    collections of internationally standardized as well as nonâ€“standardized units
    used in business and science.\r\nIt covers any standard or non-standard units
    of measure currently in use, in two or more distinct ethno-linguistic groups or
    nations, at least in one domain of industry, for which an explicit method of conversion
    to a known standard unit of measure or its equivalent is well documented or evident
    from external references."
