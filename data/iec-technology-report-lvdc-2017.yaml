  content: "Low voltage direct current (LVDC) is a disruptive technology that fundamentally
    accelerates energy access and improves energy efficiency. LVDC applications are
    many and varied, and can be applied in every country in the world.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIn developed economies, the main drivers for the use of LVDC are the improvement
    of energy efficiency and power quality as well as the conversion to renewable
    energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn developing economies, the standardization of various
    aspects of LVDC is likely to have a profound impact by facilitating electricity
    access in even the remotest of villages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis technology report
    examines LVDC in terms of market potential, access to energy, voltage standardization,
    safety and other key considerations. It pools the collective expertise and know-how
    of experts from all around the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe technology report
    was prepared by the IEC <a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:186:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:11901,25\">SEG
    4</a> on LVDC.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC Technology Report is available for
    <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/lvdc-electricity-21st-century\">free download</a>."
