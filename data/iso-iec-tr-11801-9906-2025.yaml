  content: "ISO/IEC TR 11801-9906:2025 covers cabling channel specifications, for
    cabling channels constructed from balanced single-pair cabling components, primarily
    intended for use in industrial automation and process control applications.<br
    />\r\nThe cabling channel specifications are intended to support ISO/IEC/IEEE
    8802-3 single-pair Ethernet (SPE) link segment specifications in the following
    SPE physical layer specifications (PHYs):<br />\r\na) 1000BASE T1 Type B (bp),
    with reach up to 40 m;<br />\r\nb) 1000BASE T1 Type A (bp), with reach up to 15
    m;<br />\r\nc) 100BASE T1L (dg), with reach up to 500 m;<br />\r\nd) 100BASE T1
    (bw), with reach up to 15 m;<br />\r\ne) 10BASE T1L (cg), with reach up to 1000
    m;<br />\r\nf) 10BASE T1S (cg), with reach up to 15 m.<br />\r\nThe channel component
    specifications are referenced according to corresponding IEC balanced single-pair
    cable and connector specifications.<br />\r\nChannel specifications include IL,
    RL, TCL, coupling attenuation, and alien crosstalk parameters specifications.<br
    />\r\nChannel EMC related specifications include electromagnetic isolation levels
    E1, E2 and E3, which are defined according to the MICE standard environmental
    characterization system specified in ISO/IEC 11801-1.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 11801-9906:2025
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the addition
    of ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3, 100BASE T1L (dg), long reach;<br />\r\nb) complete rearrangement
    of the information contained in Clause 4, Clause 5, Annex A, Annex B, and Annex
    C."
