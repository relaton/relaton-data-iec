abstract:
- content: It provides information and rules for the preparation of detail specifications
    for series TMA r.f. connectors together with the pro forma blank detail specification.
    Series TMA connectors have a characteristic impedance of 50 &Omega; and are normally
    used with r.f. cables or microstrip in microwave fields that has a blind entry
    and middle low power. The connectors can be used up to a frequency of at least
    6 GHz. It also prescribes mating face dimensions for general purpose connectors,
    dimensional details of standard test connectors grade 0, gauging information and
    tests selected from IEC 61169-1 applicable to all detail specifications relating
    to series TMA connectors.
