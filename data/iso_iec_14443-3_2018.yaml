abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the following:</p><p>- polling for proximity
    cards or objects (PICCs) entering the field of a proximity coupling device (PCD);</p><p>-
    the byte format, the frames and timing used during the initial phase of communication
    between PCDs and PICCs;</p><p>- the initial Request and Answer to Request command
    content;</p><p>- methods to detect and communicate with one PICC among several
    PICCs (anticollision);</p><p>- other parameters required to initialize communications
    between a PICC and PCD;</p><p>- optional means to ease and speed up the selection
    of one PICC among several PICCs based on application criteria;</p><p>- optional
    capability to allow a device to alternate between the functions of a PICC and
    a PCD to communicate with a PCD or a PICC, respectively. A device which implements
    this capability is called a PXD.</p><p>Protocol and commands used by higher layers
    and by applications and which are used after the initial phase are described in
    ISO/IEC 14443‑4.</p><p>This document is applicable to PICCs of Type A and of Type
    B (as described in ISO/IEC 14443‑2), to PCDs (as described in ISO/IEC 14443‑2)
    and to PXDs.</p><p>NOTE 1 Part of the timing of data communication is defined
    in ISO/IEC 14443‑2.</p><p>NOTE 2 Test methods for this document are defined in
    ISO/IEC 10373‑6.</p>"
