abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63282-102:2025 assesses the existing technical requirements (by
    TC 64, TC 82, SyC LVDC) and close any gaps related to electric island LVDC power
    supply systems in rural or remote areas without electricity up to a maximum of
    1 500 V only. Additionally, it covers the case of LVDC auxiliary power supply
    systems for ships.<br />\r\nSpecific technical items for electric island LVDC
    systems are explained in this document. Rationale for the proposed voltage level,
    topology, power quality, etc. are given.<br />\r\nThis document gives inputs to
    several TCs in charge of the standardization of different issues and coordinated
    by SyC LVDC."
