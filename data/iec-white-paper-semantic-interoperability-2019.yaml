  content: "Humans use words, diagrams, images, context, but also sounds, facial expressions
    or body language to be understood. Machines use data and information models as
    well as algorithms to manipulate information, and human concepts need to be translated
    for machine use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDue to the exponentially growing number of
    systems that collect, process, and share data, machines increasingly need to be
    able to communicate with each other without the intervention of humans. This requires
    increased interoperability in terms of concepts, data structures, information
    models as well as digital specifications. In addition to enabling data exchange,
    so-called semantic interoperability defines the meaning of data without the need
    for additional programming. It provides the means for two systems to understand
    each other’s conventions and functions behind the data and the context in which
    it is used. It allows computer systems to exchange data with unambiguous, shared
    meaning. Semantic interoperability will be the key to digitalization and the latest
    industrial revolution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis white paper outlines what it takes
    to achieve true machine-to-machine communication and how standards can provide
    structures that will allow machines to interact truly independently.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe white paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>)
    semantic ontologies project team with major contributions from Siemens AG and
    project partner, Prof. Dr.-Ing. Christian Diedrich, ifak e.V. Magdeburg (Germany).<br
