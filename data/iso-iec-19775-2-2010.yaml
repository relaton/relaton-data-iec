    <p>ISO/IEC 19775 defines a software system that integrates network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19775-2:2010 specifies a standard set of services that are made available by a browser so that an author can access the scene graph while it is running. Such access is designed to support interaction with, and modification of, the scene graph.</p>
