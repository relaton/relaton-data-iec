abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of a magnetic tape cartridge, using a magnetic</p><p>tape 12,7 mm wide, so as
    to provide physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies
    the quality of the</p><p>recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded
    format known as Parallel Serpentine, thereby allowing data</p><p>interchange between
    drives by means of such cartridges. The format supports variable length Logical
    Records, high speed</p><p>search, and the use of the algorithm for data compression
    specified in International Standard ISO/IEC 15200.</p><p>Information interchange
    between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange
    parties upon the</p><p>interchange code(s) and the specification of the structure
    and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p><p>Together
    with a standard for volume and file structure, e.g. International Standard ISO
    1001, this International Standard</p><p>provides for full data interchange between
    data processing systems.</p>"
