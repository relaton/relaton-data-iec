    processes with well-defined terminology that can be referenced by the software
    industry. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that apply during the stage
    of operation and use from the point of view of the supplier organization that
    enhances, maintains, and renews the application software and the software-related
    products such as data-structures, architecture, designs, and other documentation.
    It applies to the supply, maintenance, and renewal of applications, whether performed
    internally or externally with respect to the organization that uses the applications.
