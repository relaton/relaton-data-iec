abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 5392:2024 This document defines a reference architecture of knowledge
    engineering (KE) in artificial intelligence (AI). The reference architecture describes
    KE roles, activities, constructional layers, components and their relationships
    amongst themselves and other systems from systemic user and functional views.
    This document also provides a common KE vocabulary by defining KE terms.
