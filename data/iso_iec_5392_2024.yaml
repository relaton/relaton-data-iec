- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    defines a reference architecture of knowledge engineering (KE) in artificial intelligence
    (AI). The reference architecture describes KE roles, activities, constructional
    layers, components and their relationships amongst themselves and other systems
    from systemic user and functional views. This document also provides a common
    KE vocabulary by defining KE terms.</p>
