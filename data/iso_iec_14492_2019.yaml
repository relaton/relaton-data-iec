abstract:
- content: "<p>This Recommendation | International Standard defines methods for coding
    bi-level images and sets of images (documents consisting of multiple pages). It
    is particularly suitable for bi-level images consisting of text and dithered (halftone)
    data.</p><p>The methods defined permit lossless (bit-preserving) coding, lossy
    coding, and progressive coding. In progressive coding, the first image is lossy;
    subsequent images may be lossy or lossless.</p><p>This Recommendation | International
    Standard also defines file formats to enclose the coded bi-level image data.</p>"
