    <ol>
    <li>specifies a tree structure for allocations made by a hierarchical structure of Registration Authorities, called the international object identifier (OID) tree, which supports the ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER type and the ASN.1 OID-IRI type (ISO/IEC 8824-1);</li>
    <li>registers top-level arcs of the international OID tree;</li>
    <li>specifies procedures which are generally applicable to registration at any level of the international OID tree;</li>
    <li>provides guidelines for the establishment and operation of International Registration Authorities for use, when needed, by other ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards;</li>
    <li>provides guidelines for additional ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards which choose to reference the procedures in ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012;</li>
    <li>provides a recommended fee structure for lower-level Registration Authorities.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Information about registration for specific objects is contained in separate ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9834-1:2012 applies to registration by ITU-T Recommendations and/or International Standards, by International Registration Authorities, and by any other Registration Authority.</p>
