abstract:
- content: "<p>The evolution of the harmonized set of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288-12207 related</p><p>standards
    and technical reports that are discussed in this International Standard</p><p>provides
    detailed requirements and guidance on the application of system life cycle</p><p>processes.
    This International Standard unifies technical and management</p><p>requirements
    and guidance from several of these sources to specify the requirements</p><p>for
    the content of a SEMP and to provide a common SEMP format. This International</p><p>Standard
    also identifies the processes as defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 to perform</p><p>the
    necessary project planning activities to accomplish the project's technical effort
    and</p><p>to develop the project's SEMP. Due to close alignment with the content
    of</p><p>ISO/IEC 24748, ISO/IEC 26702 is now Part 4 of the multi-part International
    Standard,</p><p>ISO/IEC 24748 (<em>Systems and software engineering</em>?<em>Life
    cycle management</em>).</p>"
