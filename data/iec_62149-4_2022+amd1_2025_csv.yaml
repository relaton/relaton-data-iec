abstract:
- content: "IEC 62149-4:2022+AMD1:2025 CSV defines performance specifications for
    1 300 nm fibre optic transceiver modules used for the ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3 Gigabit
    Ethernet application. This document contains definitions for product performance
    requirements as well as a series of tests and measurements, for which clearly
    defined conditions, severities and pass/fail criteria are provided. The tests
    are intended to be run on a \"once-off\" basis to prove any product’s ability
    to satisfy the performance standard’s requirements. A product that has been shown
    to meet all the requirements of a performance standard can be declared as complying
    with the performance standard but will then be controlled by a quality assurance/quality
    conformance program. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- the normative references are updated;<br />\r\n- the condition
    \"for short periods\" in 4.1 is removed;<br />\r\n- the absolute limiting rating
    for soldering temperature in Table 1 is modified;<br />\r\n- the maximal optical
    output power (multimode fibre) in Table 4 is increased from −3,5 dBm to −3 dBm,
    to align value with the referenced document;<br />\r\n- a note is added to Table
    7 to clarify that out-of-specification products are not allowed to pass the performance
    tests."
