abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-3-4:2016 applies to transportable bench grinders that can be
    equipped with one or two accessories as follows:<br />\r\n- type 1 grinding wheels
    in accordance with ISO 603-4:1999 with a diameter not exceeding 310 mm and a thickness
    not exceeding 55 mm;<br />\r\n- wire brushes with a diameter not exceeding 310
    mm and a thickness not exceeding 55 mm;<br />\r\n- polishing wheels with a diameter
    not exceeding 310 mm and with a peripheral speed of any accessory between 10 m/s
    and 50 m/s. The attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment
    manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following
    publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products
    in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting
    new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content
    of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than
    36 months from the date of publication Keywords: Bench Grinder, Hand-held tool,
    Transportable tool<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 62841-1:2014. The contents of the corrigendum of December 2016 have been
    included in this copy."
