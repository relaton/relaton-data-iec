abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides an explanation of considerations involved in
    defining a process. This document gives requirements and recommendations for the
    description of processes by identifying elements and rules for their formulation.</p><p>This
    document also describes the use of process views.</p><p>This document explains
    how conformance to a process can be defined, when the process is described in
    accordance with this document.</p><p>This document does not describe how processes
    are composed or otherwise aggregated into larger frameworks or life cycle models.
    Nor does the document cover how to assess or evaluate the performance of a process,
    or the output (products) of a process.</p><p>NOTE Two prominent International
    Standards in process description for software and system engineering are ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288. These two standards have very similar process models.
    The information items associated with their process definitions are given in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15289. Other International Standards provide further characterization of a single
    life cycle process by elaborating the process elements and levying specific requirements
    on the execution of the process.</p><p>This document is applicable when processes
    are described for various process definitions in any party, organization or standard
    relating to systems and software engineering processes.</p>"
