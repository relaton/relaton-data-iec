abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    17346:2005 defines the characteristics of 90 mm Optical Disk Cartridges (ODC)
    with a capacity of 1,3 GB per cartridge. It specifies only Type R/W for 2 048-byte
    sectors of such cartridges.<br />\r\nType R/W provides for data to be written,
    read and erased many times over the entire recording surface of the disk using
    the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects. It is also referred to as \"fully
    rewritable\". ISO/IEC 17346:2004 provides for 2 048-byte sectors only. All sectors
    on a disk are of the same size.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 17346:2005 specifies:\r\n\r\n\tthe
    conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;\r\n\tthe environments
    in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;\r\n\tthe mechanical and
    physical characteristics of the cartridge, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    ability between data processing systems;\r\n\tthe format of the information on
    the disk, both embossed and user-written; including the physical disposition of
    the tracks and sectors, the error correction codes, and the modulation method
    used;\r\n\tthe characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;\r\n\tthe
    magneto-optical characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write
    data onto the disk;\r\n\tthe minimum quality of user-written data on the disk,
    enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC 17346:2005
    provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems."
