  content: IEC 62032:2012(E) covers the application, specification, theory of operation,
    and factory and field testing of single-phase and three-phase oil-immersed, phase-shifting
    transformers (PSTs). This international standard is limited to matters particular
    to PSTs and does not include matters relating to general requirements for power
    transformers covered in existing standards, recommended practices, or guides.
