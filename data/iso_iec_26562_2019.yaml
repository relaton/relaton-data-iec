abstract:
- content: "This document, within the context of methods and tools for supporting
    the transitioning the organization's current development approach to software
    and systems product line engineering:<br />\r\n- defines processes for product
    line transition management. Those processes are described in terms of purpose,
    inputs, tasks and outcomes;<br />\r\n- defines method capabilities to support
    the defined tasks of each process;<br />\r\n- defines tool capabilities that automate
    or semi-automate tasks and methods.<br />\r\nThis document does not concern processes
    and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with
    those for a family of products."
