  content: "IEC TR 63054:2017(E) applies to the fire risk analysis of low-voltage
    switchgear and controlgear (hereinafter referred to as \"equipment\") referring
    to the IEC 60947 relevant publications, where the following applies:<br />\r\n-
    only the case where a fire originates (typically under fault or misuse conditions)
    within the equipment;<br />\r\n- only equipment installed in normal environments.
    Hazardous environments, for example in presence of combustible materials, is not
    to be considered;<br />\r\n- only the case of products selected, installed and
    used according to the manufacturer instructions and installation rules.<br />\r\nIn
    addition, the following cases are not considered:<br />\r\n- faults addressed
    by IEC TR 61641;<br />\r\n- risks due to smoke emissions;<br />\r\n- double faults,
