abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63463:2024 provides guidelines for the general procedure for performing
    life assessment for an HVDC converter station. Following this, a more detailed
    description of performance issues of the thyristor based HVDC systems is given
    and the life assessment measures of equipment and guidelines for accessing the
    techno-economic life of equipment are given. This document also deals with information
    for specification of refurbishing HVDC system and the testing of the refurbished
    and replaced equipment. Lastly, this document outlines environmental issues and
    regulatory issues involved in the life assessment and concludes with a financial
    analysis of the refurbishment options.
