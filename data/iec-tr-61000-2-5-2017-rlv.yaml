    is a Technical Report intended for guidance for those who are in charge of considering
    and developing immunity requirements. It also gives basic guidance for the selection

    equipment, sub-system or system that operates in one of the locations as considered
    in this document.<br />\r\nThis Technical Report provides the following:<br />\r\n–<span
    style=\"font-size:7pt\">    </span>introduces the concept of disturbance degrees
    and defines these for each electromagnetic phenomena;<br />\r\n–<span style=\"font-size:7pt\">
    \   </span>classifies into various location classes and describes them by means
    of attributes;<br />\r\n–<span style=\"font-size:7pt\">    </span>provides background
    information on the different electromagnetic phenomena that may exist within the
    environment and;<br />\r\n–<span style=\"font-size:7pt\">    </span>compiles tables
    of compatibility levels for electromagnetic phenomena that are considered to be
    relevant for those location classes.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na)   the description of the radiated electromagnetic
    environment has been updated taking into account recent communication technologies;<br
    />\r\nb)   some conducted phenomena and respective interference sources have been
    described in more detail."
