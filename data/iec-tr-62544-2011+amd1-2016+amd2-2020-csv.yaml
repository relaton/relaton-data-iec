  content: IEC TR 62544:2011+A1:2016+A2:2020 gives general guidance on the subject
    of active filters for use in high-voltage direct current (HVDC) power transmission.
    It describes systems where active devices are used primarily to achieve a reduction
    in harmonics in the d.c. or a.c. systems. This excludes the use of automatically
    retuned components. The various types of circuit that can be used for active filters
    are described in the report, along with their principal operational characteristics
    and typical applications. The overall aim is to provide guidance for purchasers
    to assist with the task of specifying active filters as part of HVDC converters.
    Passive filters are specifically excluded from this report. <strong>This consolidated
    version consists of the first edition (2011), its amendment 1 (2016) and its amendment
    2 (2020) . Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.</strong>
