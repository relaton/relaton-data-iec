abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61300-3-16:2023 which is a technical specification, deals with
    the limits for harmonic (including grouped interharmonic) currents produced by
    the inverter of inverter-type electrical energy-supplying equipment (ESE) as defined
    in 3.2, but which does not include energy storage. The limits given in this document
    are applicable to inverters with a reference current as defined in 3.3 (see also
    5.2.3) less than or equal to 75 A per phase, intended to be connected to public
    low-voltage AC distribution systems of the following types:<br />\r\n- single-phase,
    two or three wires; nominal voltage up to 240 V<br />\r\n- three-phase, three
    or four wires; nominal voltage up to 690 V<br />\r\n- nominal frequency of 50
    Hz or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nThis document specifies:<br />\r\na) requirements and emission
    limits for equipment;<br />\r\nb) methods for type tests and simulations.<br />\r\nTests
    in accordance with this document are type tests of complete pieces of equipment.<br
    />\r\nEquipment which mainly absorbs energy but which is capable of supplying
    energy to the public supply as a secondary function is out of the scope of this
    document.<br />\r\nEXAMPLE An elevator motor drive returning energy during braking.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides limits and testing procedures for equipment in the
    range up to harmonic order 40 (h40), i.e. 2 000 Hz or 2 400 Hz depending on line
    frequency.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 It is possible that limits for frequencies in the range
    from 2 kHz to 9 kHz will be added in a future edition of this document.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 It is possible that limits and procedures for storage systems will be added
    in a future edition of this document."
