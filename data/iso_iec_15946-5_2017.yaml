abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO/IEC 15946 series specifies public-key cryptographic techniques
    based on elliptic curves described in ISO/IEC 15946‑1.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15946-5:2017
    defines elliptic curve generation techniques useful for implementing the elliptic
    curve based mechanisms defined in ISO/IEC 29192‑4, ISO/IEC 9796‑3, ISO/IEC 11770‑3,
    ISO/IEC 14888‑3 and ISO/IEC 18033‑2.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15946-5:2017 is applicable
    to cryptographic techniques based on elliptic curves defined over finite fields
    of prime power order (including the special cases of prime order and characteristic
    two). This document is not applicable to the representation of elements of the
    underlying finite field (i.e. which basis is used).</p><p>The ISO/IEC 15946 series
    does not specify the implementation of the techniques it defines. Interoperability
    of products complying with the ISO/IEC 15946 series will not be guaranteed.</p>"
