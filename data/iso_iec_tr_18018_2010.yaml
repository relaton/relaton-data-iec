abstract:
- content: 'Configuration management (CM) is a process central to the software engineering
    life cycle. CM has been established as an ISO/IEC standard life cycle process
    in ISO/IEC 12207:2008, Information technology — Software life cycle processes
    and ISO/IEC 15288: 2008, Information technology — System life cycle processes.
    ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC 15288:2008 describe a comprehensive set of processes,
    activities and tasks to be performed when acquiring or developing software.  However,
    these documents do not address the capabilities that a CM tool user can expect
    from a tool in order to support the CM process and other software engineering
    life cycle activities.  There is a gap between CM process descriptions and corresponding
    CM process automation services which affects both tool users and tool suppliers.ISO/IEC
    TR 18018:2010 provides guidance in the evaluation and selection for CM tools during
    acquisition. CM tool evaluation by prospective users can be complex, time consuming,
    and expensive. ISO/IEC TR 18018:2010 helps to characterize what a CM tool can
    and cannot do in the CM process. ISO/IEC TR 18018:2010 provides guidance for tool
    manufacturers in implementing a minimum set of capabilities. The capabilities
    defined in ISO/IEC TR 18018:2010 are linked to ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and ISO/IEC
    15288:2008, and will provide tool manufacturers with guidance on the characteristics
    their tools should support to meet these International Standards.'
