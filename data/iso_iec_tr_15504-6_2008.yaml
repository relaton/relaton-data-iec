abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15504 provides a framework for the assessment of process capability.
    This framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring,
    controlling and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution
    and support of products and services.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008 describes
    an exemplar Process Assessment Model (PAM) for system life cycle processes, conformant
    with the ISO/IEC 15504-2 requirements for a PAM.</p><p>The ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008
    exemplar PAM is derived from the Process Reference Model (PRM) defined in ISO/IEC
    15288, associated with the process attributes defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2. The
    resulting PAM is a two-dimensional PAM which provides indicators for guidance
    on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes as defined in ISO/IEC
    15288, and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 15504â€‘2. It can be used
    to perform a process assessment conformant with ISO/IEC 15504-2, either in the
    context of a process improvement programme or for process capability determination.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 15504-6:2008 describes</p><ul><li>the overall structure of the PAM with its
    process dimension (derived from ISO/IEC 15288) and capability dimension (derived
    from the measurement framework defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2);</li><li>process performance
    indicators (base practices and work products) for 26 processes drawn from ISO/IEC
    15288;</li><li>process capability indicators (generic practices, generic resources
    and generic work products) which characterize, for any process attribute of the
    capability dimension, what are the expected characteristics that demonstrate achievement
    of that process attribute.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008 also includes</p><ul><li>the
    demonstration of conformity of the PAM with the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2;</li><li>the
    detailed characteristics of the work products and the generic work products;</li><li>guidance
    for adapting the PAM and defining additional assessment indicators.</li></ul>"
