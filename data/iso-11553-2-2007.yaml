  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO 11553-2:2007 specifies the requirements
    for laser processing devices, as defined in ISO 11553-1, which are hand-held or
    hand-operated. The purpose of ISO 11553-2:2007 is to draw attention to the particular
    hazards related to the use of hand-held laser and hand-operated laser processing
    devices and to prevent personal injury. This includes both the areas of hazard
    analysis and risk assessment as well as protective measures.
