  content: "IEC 60580:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60580:2019
    specifies the performance and testing of Dose Area Product Meters intended to
    measure Dose Area Product and/or Dose Area Product Rate to which the Patient is
    exposed during Medical Radiological Examinations. This document is applicable
    to the following types of Dose Area Product Meters:<br />\r\na) Field-Class Dose
    Area Product Meters normally used for the measurement of Dose Area Products during
    Medical Radiological Examinations;<br />\r\nb) Reference-Class Dose Area Product
    Meters normally used for the Calibration of Field-Class Dosimeters.<br />\r\nNOTE
    Reference-Class Dose Area Product Meters can be used as Field-Class Dose Area
    Product Meters.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is<br />\r\n1) to establish
    requirements for a satisfactory level of performance for Dose Area Product Meters,
    and<br />\r\n2) to standardize the methods for the determination of compliance
    with this level of performance.<br />\r\nTwo levels of performance are specified:<br
    />\r\n– a lower level of performance applying to Field-Class Dose Area Product
    Meters;<br />\r\n– a higher level of performance applying to Reference-Class Dose
    Area Product Meters.<br />\r\nIEC 60580:2019 cancels and replaces the second edition
    published 2000, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) a second class of devices is introduced with tighter uncertainty tolerances;<br
    />\r\nb) this document has been expanded to include detectors other than ionization
    chambers;<br />\r\nc) radiation qualities have been updated to the new definitions
    according to IEC 61267;<br />\r\nd) a requirement on the linearity of the dose
    area product rate measurement was added;<br />\r\ne) changed chamber light transmission
    requirement from 70 % to 60 %."
