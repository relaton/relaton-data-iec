abstract:
- content: 'IEC TS 62989:2018(E) encompasses key characteristics of primary optical
    elements (lenses and mirrors) and lens or mirror parquets for concentrator photovoltaics
    including: optical performance, mechanical geometry, mechanical strength, materials,
    and surface morphology. The document identifies the essential characteristics,
    the corresponding quantities of interest, and provides a method for measurement
    of each quantity.'
