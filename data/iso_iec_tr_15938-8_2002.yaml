abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 15938-8:2002 forms an informative part of ISO/IEC 15938 on
    extraction and use of metadata descriptions for multimedia content.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 15938-8:2002 provides two types of information:<br />\r\ninformative examples
    that illustrate the instantiation of description tools in creating descriptions
    conforming to ISO/IEC 15938, and<br />\r\ndetailed technical information on extracting
    descriptions automatically from multimedia content and using them in multimedia
    applications.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 15938-8:2002 is a companion for ISO/IEC
    15938-3 (Visual) and ISO/IEC 15938-5 (Multimedia Description Schemes), which provide
    normative definitions of the description tools. Effort has been made in this Technical
    Report to preserve the subclause numbering of ISO/IEC 15938-3 and ISO/IEC 15938-5
    to allow easy mapping of the information on extraction and use with those technical
    specifications."
