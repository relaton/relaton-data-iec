abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19778:2015 specifies a table-based approach for defining Data Models.
    This Data Model specification is used for specifying the collaborative workplace
    Data Model. The same Data Model specification is also used in ISO/IEC 19778‑2
    and ISO/IEC 19778‑3 to define the related components of the collaborative environment
    (ISO/IEC 19778‑2) and the collaborative group (ISO/IEC 19778‑3) in separate Data
    Models.The collaborative workplace Data Model specifies the Data Model Elements
    and their interrelationships that enable the creation of collaborative workplace
    Data Model instantiations.Any conforming collaborative workplace Data Model instantiation
    describes or specifies a particular collaborative workplace with which it is associated.
