abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19778:2015 specifies a table-based approach for defining Data
    Models. This Data Model specification is used for specifying the collaborative
    workplace Data Model. The same Data Model specification is also used in ISO/IEC
    19778‑2 and ISO/IEC 19778‑3 to define the related components of the collaborative
    environment (ISO/IEC 19778‑2) and the collaborative group (ISO/IEC 19778‑3) in
    separate Data Models.</p><p>The collaborative workplace Data Model specifies the
    Data Model Elements and their interrelationships that enable the creation of collaborative
    workplace Data Model instantiations.</p><p>Any conforming collaborative workplace
    Data Model instantiation describes or specifies a particular collaborative workplace
    with which it is associated.</p>"
