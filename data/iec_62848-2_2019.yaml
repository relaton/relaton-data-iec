abstract:
- content: "IEC 62848-2:2019 applies to Voltage Limiting Devices (VLDs) to be applied
    in DC traction systems in order to comply with protective provisions against electric
    shock from DC, and combined AC â€“ DC voltages, in accordance with the IEC 62128
    series, taking into account stray current provisions.<br />\r\nVLDs operate in
    such a way as to connect the track return circuit of DC railway systems to the
    earthing system or to conductive parts within the overhead contact line zone or
    current collector zone."
