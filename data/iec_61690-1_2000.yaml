abstract:
- content: IEC 61690-1:2000 defines the syntax and semantics for EDIF Version 3 0
    0. EDIF Version 3 0 0 addresses EDIF Level 0 and Level 1. EDIF Version 3 0 0 completely
    addresses the Connectivity and Schematic views, including at Level 1 the ability
    to represent frames. It includes capabilities formerly found in the Document and
    Graphics views. A series of releases is planned in the near future to address
    those views not completely addressed in this version.
