abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses some of the security requirements in the areas
    of authentication and other security services through the provision of a set of
    frameworks upon which full services can be based. Specifically, this Recommendation
    | International Standard defines frameworks for:</p><p>? public-key certificates;
    and</p><p>? attribute certificates.</p><p>The public-key certificate framework
    defined in this Recommendation | International Standard specifies the information
    objects and data types for a public-key infrastructure (PKI), including public-key
    certificates, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), trust broker and authorization
    and validation lists (AVLs). The attribute certificate framework specifies the
    information objects and data types for a privilege management infrastructure (PMI),
    including attribute certificates, and attribute certificate revocation lists (ACRLs).
    This Recommendation | International Standard also provides the framework for issuing,
    managing, using and revoking certificates. An extensibility mechanism is included
    in the defined formats for both certificate types and for all revocation list
    schemes. This Recommendation | International Standard also includes a set of extensions,
    which is expected to be generally useful across a number of applications of PKI
    and PMI. The schema components (including object classes, attribute types and
    matching rules) for storing PKI and PMI information in a directory, are included
    in this Recommendation | International Standard.</p><p>This Recommendation | International
    Standard specifies the framework for strong authentication, involving credentials
    formed using cryptographic techniques. It is not intended to establish this as
    a general framework for authentication, but it can be of general use for applications
    which consider these techniques adequate.</p><p>Authentication (and other security
    services) can only be provided within the context of a defined security policy.
    It is a matter for users of an application to define their own security policy.</p>"
