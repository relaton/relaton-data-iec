  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19785-2:2006 specifies the requirements for the operation of
    the Biometric Registration Authority within the Common Biometric Exchange Formats
    Framework (CBEFF). The Registration Authority is responsible for assigning and
    publishing, via its website, unique biometric organization identifier values to
    organizations that own or are otherwise responsible for standardized or proprietary
    format specifications for biometric data blocks, biometric information record
    security blocks and/or CBEFF patron formats, and to organizations that intend
    to assign biometric product identifier values to their products.</p>"
