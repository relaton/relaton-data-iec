  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-7:2023, which is a Technical Report, describes functions
    for power converter-based distributed energy resources (DER) systems, focused
    on DC-to-AC and AC-to-AC conversions and including photovoltaic systems (PV),
    battery storage systems, electric vehicle (EV) charging systems, and any other
    DER systems with a controllable power converter. The functions defined in this
    document were used to help define the information models described in IEC 61850-7-420
    and which can be used in the exchange of information between these power converter-based
    DER systems and the utilities, energy service providers (ESPs), or other entities
    which are tasked with managing the volt, var, and watt capabilities of these power
    converter-based systems. These power converter-based DER systems can range from
    very small grid-connected systems at residential customer sites, to medium-sized
    systems configured as microgrids on campuses or communities, to very large systems
    in utility-operated power plants, and to many other configurations and ownership
    models. They may or may not combine different types of DER systems behind the
    power converter, such as a power converter-based DER system and a battery that
    are connected at the DC level. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2013. This edition is primarily an editorial revision in
    order to be consistent with the publication of Edition 2 of IEC 61850-7-420:2021.
    This edition includes the following significant changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 3 has been updated.<br />\r\nb) Clause 8 (IEC 61850
    information models for power converter-based functions) has been deleted. This
    clause defined data models with the transitional namespace “(Tr) IEC 61850-90-7:2012”.
    The data models are now defined in IEC 61850-7-420."
