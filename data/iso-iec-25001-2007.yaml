    <p>ISO/IEC 25001:2007 provides details about the planning and management requirements associated with software product quality requirements and evaluation.</p>
    <p>While it is mainly concerned with product quality requirements and evaluation, wherever it is relevant the corresponding process requirements and evaluation activities are also discussed.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25001:2007 aims to clarify the requirements which should be identified by the organization in order to ensure the success of specifying quality requirements and executing the evaluation. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25001:2007 is intended to be used in conjunction with the other parts of the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC 25000-ISO/IEC 25051) of International Standards, and with ISO/IEC 14598 and ISO/IEC 9126-1 until superseded by the ISO/IEC 25000 series of International Standards.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25001:2007 complies with the technical processes identified in ISO/IEC 15288 related to quality requirements definition and analysis. </p>
