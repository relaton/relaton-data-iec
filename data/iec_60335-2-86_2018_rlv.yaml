abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-86:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-86:2018
    deals with the safety of electric fishing machines by means of which water may
    be electrified for the purpose of catching fish or for providing barriers to all
    animals living in water. The rated voltage of electric fishing machines is not
    more than 250 V for single phase machines and 480 V for other machines, except
    that the rated voltage of electric fishing machines for permanent connection to
    fixed wiring is not more than 1 000 V. Electric fishing machines are appliances
    for scientific and commercial use. Additional requirements for boat mounted electric
    fishing machines are given in Annex AA. This Part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established
    on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2002, its Amendment 1 (2005)
    and its Amendment 2 (2012). This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5, and its Amendments
    1 and 2;<br />\r\n- some notes have been converted to normative text (22.102,
    22.113, 26.106);<br />\r\n- requirements for battery-operated electric fishing
    machines have been moved to Annex S."
