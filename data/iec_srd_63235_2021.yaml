abstract:
- content: IEC SRD 63235:2021 provides a holistic system of systems approach to provide
    views, methodology framework, principles, processes, rules, and evaluation criteria
    for smart city system concepts building. While it does not specify the definitions
    of a smart city system, it provides a methodology based on system approaches for
    coordination, cooperation and connectivity of the terminology sources including
    IEC, ISO and ITU. The methodology fosters a multi-dimensional system of systems
    view on smart city systems across dimensions, domains and layers along the lifecycle
    of a smart city system, scenarios and use cases, supporting the sustainable development
    of smart city system arrangements, activities and artefacts, convergence of people,
    process and productivity globally.
