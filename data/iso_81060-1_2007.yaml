abstract:
- content: ISO 81060-1:2007 specifies requirements for non-automated sphygmomanometers
    and their accessories, which, by means of inflatable cuffs, are used for the non-invasive
    blood pressure measurement by operator observation. ISO 81060-1:2007 specifies
    requirements for the safety and essential performance, including effectiveness
    and labelling, for non-automated sphygmomanometers and their accessories, including
    test methods to determine the accuracy of non-invasive blood pressure measurement.
    ISO 81060-1:2007 covers non-invasive blood pressure measurement devices with a
    pressure-sensing element and display used in conjunction with means of detecting
    blood flow.
