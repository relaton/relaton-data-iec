  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017 provides a common vocabulary applicable to
    all systems and software engineering work. It was prepared to collect and standardize
    terminology. ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017 is intended to serve as a useful reference
    for those in the information technology field, and to encourage the use of systems
    and software engineering standards prepared by ISO and liaison organizations IEEE
    Computer Society and Project Management Institute. ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2017 includes
    references to the active source standards for definitions so that systems and
    software engineering concepts and requirements can be further explored.</p>"
