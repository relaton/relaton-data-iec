  content: IEC TR 62351-13:2016(E) provides guidelines on what security topics could
    or should be covered in standards and specifications (IEC or otherwise) that are
    to be used in the power industry, and the audience is therefore the developers
    of standards and specifications. These guidelines cannot be prescriptive for every
    standard, since individual standards and specifications may legitimately have
    very different focuses, but it should be expected that the combination of such
    standards and specifications used in any implementation should cover these security
    topics. These guidelines are therefore to be used as a checklist for the combination
    of standards and specifications used in implementations of systems.
