    administrative and evolution information related to ontologies.</p><p>The metamodel
    is intended to promote interoperability among application systems, by providing
    administrative and evolution information related to ontologies, accompanied with
    standardized ontology repositories that register ontologies themselves in specific
    languages.</p><p>This document does not specify the metamodels of ontologies expressed
    in specific languages and the mappings among them.</p>"
