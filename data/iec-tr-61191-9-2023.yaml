  content: "IEC TR 61191-9:2023, which is a Technical Report, applies to electronic
    and electromechanical automotive circuit board assemblies and describes current
    best practices for dealing with electrochemical reactions like migration or corrosion
    and ionic contamination on the surface of a circuit board as one failure mode
    under humidity load. This document deals with the evaluation of materials and
    manufacturing processes for the manufacturing of electronic assemblies with focus
    on their reliability under humidity loads. The electrical operation of a device
    in a humid environment can trigger electrochemical reactions that can lead to
    short circuits and malfunctions on the assembly. In this context, a large number
    of terms and methods are mentioned, such as CAF (conductive anodic filament),
    anodic migration phenomena, dendrite growth, cathodic migration, ROSE (resistivity
    of solvent extract), ionic contamination, SIR (surface insulation resistance),
    impedance spectroscopy, etc., which are used and interpreted differently. The
    aim of the document is to achieve a uniform use of language and to list the possibilities
    and limitations of common measurement methods. The focus of the document is on
    the error pattern of electrochemical migration on the surface of assemblies with
    cathodic formation of dendrites.<br />\r\nEvaluation of different test methods
    of control units under high humidity load are not part of this document."
