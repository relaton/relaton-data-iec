abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20116:2004 specifies supplementary service Message Centre Monitoring/Mailbox Identification
    (SS-MCM/MID), which is related, but not limited, to various basic services supported
    by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). Basic services are specified
    in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nThe supplementary service MCM enables a Served User
    to get informed by a Message Centre about the status and status changes of messages
    stored in that Served Users Mailbox.<br />\r\nThe supplementary service MID enables
    a Message Centre to identify a specific mailbox of a Served User in the event
    that the Served User has more than one Mailbox within the Message Centre. In addition,
    SS-MID enables a Served User to authenticate himself/herself at a specific Mailbox
    located within the Message Centre.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced
    in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 20116:2004
    contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-MCM/MID. The stage 1 specification
    specifies the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification
    specifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary service and the
    information flows between them."
