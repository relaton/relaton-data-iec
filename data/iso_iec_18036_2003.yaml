    that are represented by World Wide Web browser applications on a computer screen

    represent actions by association with objects in the real world and conventional
    controls on hardware, and that prompt the user to recall the intended actions.ISO/IEC
    18036:2003 provides a consistent set of icons applying to such functions as: Back,
    Forward, Refresh, Home, Search, Print and Stop.Each icon in ISO/IEC 18036:2003
    is specified with the following:Primary function;Specific instance;Components;Graphic.Web
    browser toolbar icons enable users to invoke functions that act upon pre-selected
    or default objects. Functions initiated by these icons may also be available via
    text commands on menus. Web browser toolbar icons provide direct access to functions
    by graphically representing those text commands.'
