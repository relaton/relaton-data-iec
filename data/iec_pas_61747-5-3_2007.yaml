abstract:
- content: "This PAS applies to commercially available liquid crystal displays (LCDs).
    \nThis PAS applies to all LCD types, including transmissive, reflective or transflective
    LCD modules using either segment, passive or active matrix and achromatic or colour-type
    LCDs that are equipped with their own integrated source of illumination or without
    their own source of illumination.\nThe object of this PAS is to establish uniform
    requirements for accurate and reliable measurements of the following LCD parameters,
    as defined herein: a) quasistatic strength; b) quasistatic fatigue.\nThe methods
    described in this PAS apply to all sizes, small and large, of LCDs."
