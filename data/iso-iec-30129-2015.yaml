  content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO&#x2F;IEC 30129:2015(E) specifies
    requirements and recommendations for the design and installation of connections
    (bonds) between various electrically conductive elements in buildings and other
    structures, during their construction or refurbishment, in which information technology
    (IT) and, more generally, telecommunications equipment is intended to be installed
    in order to:</br>\r\na) minimise the risk to the correct function of that equipment
    and interconnecting cabling from electrical hazards and</br>\r\nb) provide the
    telecommunications installation with a reliable signal reference - which may improve
    immunity from electromagnetic interference (EMI)."
