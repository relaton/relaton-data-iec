  content: A PAS is a technical specification not fulfilling the requirements for
    a standard, but made available to the public and established in an organization
    operating under given procedures. IEC-PAS 61883-6 was submitted by the 1394 Trade
    Association. Applies to all modules or devices which have any kind of audio and/or
    music data processing, generation and conversion function blocks. All modules
    or devices which implement this A/M protocol should have the capability of "arbitrated
    short bus reset" defined in IEEE-P1394a in order to prevent the interruption of
    audio and music data transmission when a bus reset occurs.
