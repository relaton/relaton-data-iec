  content: "IEC 62025-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62025-2:2019
    specifies a test method for the non-electrical characteristics of the surface
    mounted device (SMD) inductors to be used for electronic and telecommunication
    equipment. The object of this part of this document is to define methods for measuring
    mechanical performance only. As the reliability performances and specifications
    relative to non-electrical performances are defined in IEC 62211, detailed measuring
    methods for mechanical performance of reliability testing are defined in this
    document. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of Table 5;<br />\r\n- revision
    of normative references."
