abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10646:2011 specifies the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS).
    It is applicable to the representation, transmission, interchange, processing,
    storage, input and presentation of the written form of the languages of the world
    as well as additional symbols. It covers over 109 000 characters from the world's
    scripts.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10646:2011:</p>\n\nspecifies the architecture of ISO/IEC
    10646; \ndefines terms used ISO/IEC 10646; \ndescribes the general structure of
    the UCS codespace; \nspecifies the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) of the UCS;
    \nspecifies supplementary planes of the UCS: the Supplementary Multilingual Plane
    (SMP), the Supplementary Ideographic Plane (SIP), the Tertiary Ideographic Plane
    (TIP), and the Supplementary Special-purpose Plane (SSP); \ndefines a set of graphic
    characters used in scripts and the written form of languages on a world-wide scale;
    \nspecifies the names for the graphic characters and format characters of the
    BMP, SMP, SIP, TIP, SSP and their coded representations within the UCS codespace;
    \nspecifies the coded representations for control characters and private use characters;
    \nspecifies three encoding forms of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32; \nspecifies
    seven encoding schemes of the UCS: UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32,
    UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE; \nspecifies the management of future additions to this
    coded character set.<p>The UCS is an encoding system different from that specified
    in ISO/IEC 2022. ISO/IEC 10646:2011 specifies the method to designate UCS from
    ISO/IEC 2022.</p><p>A graphic character will be assigned only one code point in
    the standard, located either in the BMP or in one of the supplementary planes.</p><p>By
    defining a consistent way of encoding multilingual text, ISO/IEC 10646:2011 enables
    the exchange of data internationally. The information technology industry gains
    data stability, greater global interoperability and data interchange. ISO/IEC
    10646:2011 has been widely adopted in new Internet protocols and implemented in
    modern operating systems and computer languages.</p>"
