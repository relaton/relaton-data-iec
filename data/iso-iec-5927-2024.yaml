    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies how augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) devices are to be set up and used in the enterprise workplace in a manner that ensures health and safety (H&amp;S) is maintained, H&amp;S consequences are understood, and additional risks are not introduced. Within this concept of safe usage, there is particular focus on guidance around safe immersion (time) and safety in the workplace.</span></p>

    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document focuses on visual aspects of AR and VR. Other modes such as haptics and olfactory are not addressed within this document.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document covers both the hardware (the physical AR/VR head mounted displays) and areas of visual stimulus (the environments and graphics displayed in those headsets). This document does not cover all possible visual stimulus scenarios; focus is directed toward those areas that are known to have implications on safe use. This specifically includes the source vection (visual illusion of self-motion in physically stationary AR/VR users) and/or motion (physical movement of AR/VR users) and associated safe use considerations.</span></p>
    <p class="Note"><span lang="EN-GB">NOTE<span style="mso-tab-count: 1;">          </span>AR/VR have some shared safety concerns, but many are distinct to AR or VR and a consumer or enterprise environment. As such all of these are in scope, and this document is structured to account for these differences.</span></p>
