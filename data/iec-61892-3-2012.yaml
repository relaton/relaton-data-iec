    IEC 61892-3:2012(E) contains provisions for electrical equipment in mobile and fixed offshore units including pipeline, pumping or 'pigging' stations, compressor stations and exposed location single buoy moorings, used in the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, processing and for storage purposes. This standard applies to equipment in all installations, whether permanent, temporary, transportable or hand-held, to a.c. installations up to and including 35 000 V and d.c. installations up to and including 1 500 V (a.c. and d.c. voltages are nominal values). This standard sets requirements for equipment, which are additional to the requirements given in the product standard for the relevant equipment. This standard does not apply to the electrical installations in rooms used for medical purposes or in tankers. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    a) Table 4 in the previous edition of IEC 61892-3 regarding type testing has been deleted. Information regarding environmental conditions, including requirements to vibration, is now given in Clause 4;<br />
    b) for liquid immersed transformers requirement for overheating alarm and shut down has been added;<br />
    c) requirements for low voltage switchgear and controlgear have been rewritten, based on IEC 61439-1 and IEC 61439-2. Only additional requirements to those given in IEC 61439 are given in the standard;<br />
    d) requirements to low voltage circuit breakers, switches, contactors and fuses have been added;<br />
    e) requirement for subdivision of high voltage switchboard has been added;<br />
    f) requirements for luminaires have been deleted and replaced with reference to IEC 60598 series and IEC 60092-306;<br />
    g) requirements for heating and cooking appliances have been deleted and replaced with reference to IEC 60335 series;<br />
