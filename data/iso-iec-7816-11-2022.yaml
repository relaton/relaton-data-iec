  content: "<p>This document specifies security-related interindustry commands that
    are intended to be used for personal verification through biometric methods in
    integrated circuit cards. It also defines the data structure and data access methods
    for use of the card as a carrier of the biometric reference and/or as the device
    to perform the verification of the cardholder's biometric probe (on-card biometric
    comparison). Identification of persons using biometric methods is outside the
    scope of this document.</p>"
