abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63117:2021(E) specifies the safety requirements of lighting systems
    at the system level, applicable when designing a lighting system.<br />\r\nA lighting
    system comprises a set of products. Safety requirements of the products are not
    covered in this document, but specified in product safety standards.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒFor
    emergency lighting systems, national or regional regulations provide relevant
    information that can be firstly consulted.<br />\r\nThis document specifies safety
    requirements for lighting systems based on specific networks.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not cover cyber-security and information security of lighting systems.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to lighting systems to be installed in potential
    explosive atmospheres which are under the scope of IEC TC 31.<br />\r\nFor lighting
    systems based on an information and communication technology (ICT) network, refer
    to IEC 62949. For lighting systems based on a home and building electronic system
    and building automation and control system (HBES/BACS) network, refer to IEC 63044-3."
