abstract:
- content: "ISO 15118-9:2022 This document specifies conformance tests in the form
    of an abstract test suite (ATS) for a system under test (SUT) implementing an
    electric-vehicle or supply-equipment communication controller (EVCC or SECC) with
    support for WLAN-based high-level communication (HLC) according to ISO 15118‑8
    and against the background of ISO 15118-1. These conformance tests specify the
    testing of capabilities and behaviours of an SUT, as well as checking what is
    observed against the conformance requirements specified in ISO 15118‑8 and against
    what the implementer states the SUT implementation's capabilities are.<br />\r\nThe
    capability tests within the ATS check that the observable capabilities of the
    SUT are in accordance with the static conformance requirements defined in ISO
    15118‑8. The behaviour tests of the ATS examine an implementation as thoroughly
    as practical over the full range of dynamic conformance requirements defined in
    ISO 15118‑8 and within the capabilities of the SUT (see NOTE below).<br />\r\nA
    test architecture is described in correspondence to the ATS. The abstract test
    cases in this document are described leveraging this test architecture and are
    specified in descriptive tabular format for the ISO/OSI physical and data link
    layers (layers 1 and 2).<br />\r\nIn terms of coverage, this document only covers
    normative sections and requirements in ISO 15118‑8. This document can additionally
    refer to specific tests for requirements on referenced standards (e.g. IEEE, or
    industry consortia standards, like WiFi Alliance) as long as they are relevant
    in terms of conformance for implementations according to ISO 15118‑8. However,
    it is explicitly not intended to widen the scope of this conformance specification
    to such external standards, if it is not technically necessary for the purpose
    of conformance testing for ISO 15118‑8. Furthermore, the conformance tests specified
    in this document do not include the assessment of performance nor robustness or
    reliability of an implementation. They cannot provide judgments on the physical
    realization of abstract service primitives, how a system is implemented, how it
    provides any requested service, nor the environment of the protocol implementation.
    Furthermore, the abstract test cases defined in this document only consider the
    communication protocol and the system's behaviour defined ISO 15118‑8. The power
    flow between the EVSE and the EV is not considered.<br />\r\nNOTE Practical limitations
    make it impossible to define an exhaustive test suite, and economic considerations
    can restrict testing even further. Hence, the purpose of this document is to increase
    the probability that different implementations are able to interwork. This is
    achieved by verifying them by means of a protocol test suite, thereby increasing
    the confidence that each implementation conforms to the protocol specification.
    However, the specified protocol test suite cannot guarantee conformance to the
    specification since it detects errors rather than their absence. Thus, conformance
    to a test suite alone cannot guarantee interworking. Instead, it gives confidence
    that an implementation has the required capabilities and that its behaviour conforms
    consistently in representative instances of communication."
