  content: "IEC 62106-6:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62106-6:2023
    contains the technical specifications for Open Data Applications in the public
    domain. This document is maintained by the RDS Forum Office. The RDS Forum Office
    applies an easy procedure for registering new Open Data Applications, to ensure
    that they can be used without the need to change the RDS standard. The ODA feature
    permits defining new applications that can be decoded on a receiver. The receiver
    needs to the adequate software handler for the specific AID, which identifies
    the application. Receivers that have not implemented the software handler needed
    for decoding are not affected by ODA data received for any of the applications
    already defined and specified. The procedure for registering a new ODA is described
    in IEC 62106-3.<br />\r\nIEC 62106-6:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Annex E: coding of station logo;<br />\r\nb) Annex F: coding
    of slideshow;<br />\r\nc) Annex G: coding of internet connection;<br />\r\nd)
    Annex H: ODA tool – RDS data stream NFM."
