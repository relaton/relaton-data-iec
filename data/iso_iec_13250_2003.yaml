abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 13250:2003 (2<sup>nd</sup> edition) specifies two syntaxes for
    the interchange of Topic Maps. One of these syntaxes is based on the ISO/IEC 10744:1997
    (HyTime) meta-DTD (meta Document Type Definition), and it is itself specified
    as a meta-DTD. The other, called XTM (XML Topic Maps), is specified as an eXtensible
    Markup Language (XML) DTD.<br /><br />\r\nBoth syntaxes allow the expression of:\r\n
    \r\n\t associations between subjects of discourse and zero or more of their names,
    to be used in various contexts, \r\n\t associations between subjects and occurrences
    (pieces of relevant addressable information), \r\n\t user-defined associations
    among any arbitrary subjects of discourse, \r\n\t user-defined subjects which
    are classes of subjects, including classes of associations and the distinct roles
    that are played in instances of associations, and \r\n\t scopes, expressed as
    sets of subjects, within the context of which specific associations are meant
    to be understood as valid and/or relevant."
