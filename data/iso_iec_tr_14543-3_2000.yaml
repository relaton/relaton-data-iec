abstract:
- content: 'Describes the architecture of a standardised home control system, called
    the Home Electronic System, HES. Discusses the communication and interoperability
    aspects of HES. Uses the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, or more precisely:
    the layering principles borrowed from OSI. Hence the HES reference model defines
    the modular (layered) structure of the HES communication protocol. The detailed
    issues of addressing and application protocols for the Home Electronic System
    of different classes will be given in related standards.'
