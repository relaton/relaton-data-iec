abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19583-22:2018 This document provides a usage scenario that
    utilizes the facilities defined in ISO/IEC 11179-3, ISO/IEC 19763-5 and ISO/IEC
    19763-10 to demonstrate the registration of the mapping between process models.
    The availability of these registered process model mappings will help to promote
    the reuse of process models.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document is limited to
    a discussion of the process models associated with software development projects
    and the deliverables produced during these projects.<br />\r\nThis document describes
    a scenario that evaluates the combined usage of ISO/IEC 11179-3, ISO/IEC 19763-5
    and ISO/IEC 19763-10 to enable the reuse of past knowledge of process models describing
    project processes and deliverables."
