    <p>ISO/IEC 9973:2006 specifies procedures to be followed in preparing, maintaining and publishing a register of identifiers and meanings for International Standards under the direction of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24.</p>
    <p>Registration procedures do not assign values of identifiers that are defined as being workstation-dependent by specific graphics standards. The register of font appearance in the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24 register for graphical items is not intended to address the broader issues of general-purpose font registration.</p>
