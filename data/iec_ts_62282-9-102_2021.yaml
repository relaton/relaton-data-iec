abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62282-9-102:2021 provides a set of specific rules, requirements
    and guidelines (i.e. so-called product category rules (PCR) according to ISO 14025
    and thus in line with ISO 14040 and ISO 14044) for characterizing the environmental
    performance of stationary fuel cell combined heat and power (CHP) systems, and
    alternative systems for residential applications based on life cycle thinking
    primarily for communication to consumers.<br />\r\nThis document covers stationary
    fuel cell CHP systems and alternative heat (and power) systems for residential
    applications that primarily serve heating purposes. The systems can be complemented
    with a hot water storage tank and one or more additional heat generators. The
    systems are connected to the electricity grid. The environmental performance is
    characterized in an EPD for each individual heat-related device or CHP generator
    separately. This document also describes how the environmental performance of
    a given combination of heat-related devices (including CHP generators) is characterized
    based on the environmental performance of its individual components. The domestic
    heat distribution system, district heating, or local infrastructures for fuel
    supply or for fuel storage are not considered"
