  content: IEC TS 62446-3:2017(E) defines outdoor thermographic (infrared) inspection
    of PV modules and plants in operation. This inspection supports the preventive
    maintenance for fire protection, the availability of the system for power production,
    and the inspection of the quality of the PV modules. This document lays down requirements
    for the measurement equipment, ambient conditions, inspection procedure, inspection
    report, personnel qualification and a matrix for thermal abnormalities as a guideline
    for the inspection.
