abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 2382-37:2017 establishes a systematic description of the concepts
    in the field of biometrics pertaining to recognition of human beings and reconciles
    variant terms in use in pre-existing biometric standards against the preferred
    terms, thereby clarifying the use of terms in this field.<p>Excluded from the
    scope of this document are concepts (represented by terms) from information technology,
    pattern recognition, biology, mathematics, etc. Biometrics uses such fields of
    knowledge as a basis.</p><p>In principle, mode specific terms are outside of scope
    of this document.</p><p>Words that are<strong>bolded</strong> are defined in this
    document. Words that are not bolded are understood in their natural language sense.
    The authority for natural language use of terms in this document is the Concise
    Oxford English Dictionary, Thumb Index Edition (tenth edition, revised, 2002).
    Words used in their natural language sense are considered out-of-scope for further
    definition in this document.</p>
