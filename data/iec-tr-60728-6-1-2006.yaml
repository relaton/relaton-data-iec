  content: provides guidelines and procedures for determining the overall performance
    of optical transmissions systems used in cable networks for television signals,
    sound signals and interactive services. It is based on the requirements for optical
    equipment defined in IEC 60728-6 and should be used together with this standard.
    The information provided is meant to help field engineers and network planners
    (system designers) in planning and designing optical systems. Though this content
    is less dense than in a standard, basic knowledge about system parameters of cable
    networks is needed.
