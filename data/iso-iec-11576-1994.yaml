  content: "<p>Specifies the procedure to be followed by a registration authority
    in preparing, maintaining und publishing an international register of numeric
    identifiers allocated to the algorithms, excluding cryptographic ones. Describes
    in detail: registration authority; sponsoring authorities; registration, withdrawal,
    correction and revision procedure; early reservation of an identifier. An identifier
    registered in accordance with this standard serves as an identification of the
    algorithm associated with it in the register. Apart from such identification,
    registration does not affect the status of the algorithm concerned.</p>"
