abstract:
- content: The SCSI command set is designed to provide efficient peer-to-peer operation
    of input&#x2F;output devices (disks, tapes, printers, etc.) by an operating system;
    it assumes a command-response protocol. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776 defines
    a protocol for the transport of commands and data over High Performance Serial
    Bus. The transport protocol, Serial Bus Protocol 2 or SBP-2, permits the exchange
    of commands, data and status between initiators and targets connected to Serial
    Bus. Serial interconnects offer a migration path for SCSI into the future because
    they may be better suited to cost reduction and speed increases than the parallel
    interconnects first utilized by SCSI. The solutions provided by SBP-2 are of general
    applicability to large classes of Serial Bus peripheral devices. Mechanisms are
    provided for the delivery of commands, date and status independent of the command
    set or device class of the peripheral. SBP-2 provides a generic framework that
    may be referenced by other documents or standards that address the unique requirements
    of a particular class of devices.
