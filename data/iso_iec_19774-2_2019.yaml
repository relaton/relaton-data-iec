abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the method of motion capture animation using H-Anim
    humanoid models. Each humanoid model consists of an articulated character with
    specified joints and motion capture data. As specified in ISO/IEC 19774-1, each
    character consists of joints and segments in a hierarchical structure.<br />\r\nThis
    document includes the following:<br />\r\n- Concepts of motion capture as related
    to humanoid animation,<br />\r\n- Concepts of motion capture data definition,<br
    />\r\n- Definition of motion parameters and motion-capture animation data for
    transferring or exchanging motion between different humanoid character models,<br
    />\r\n- Mapping the structure of motion capture data to the structure of H-Anim
    objects,<br />\r\n- HAnim motion capture animation using interpolators,<br />\r\n-
    HAnim motion definition using H-Anim Motion objects, and<br />\r\n- A method for
    generating and specifying an H-Anim motion capture animation.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies a standard technique for exchanging humanoid animation using motion
    capture. It does not mandate using any specific run-time system to render the
    H-Anim characters or animations."
