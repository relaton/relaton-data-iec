abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the method of motion capture animation using
    H-Anim humanoid models. Each humanoid model consists of an articulated character
    with specified joints and motion capture data. As specified in ISO/IEC 19774-1,
    each character consists of joints and segments in a hierarchical structure.</p><p>This
    document includes the following:</p><p>— Concepts of motion capture as related
    to humanoid animation,</p><p>— Concepts of motion capture data definition,</p><p>—
    Definition of motion parameters and motion-capture animation data for transferring
    or exchanging motion between different humanoid character models,</p><p>— Mapping
    the structure of motion capture data to the structure of H-Anim objects,&lt;/li&gt;</p><p>—
    HAnim motion capture animation using interpolators,</p><p>— HAnim motion definition
    using H-Anim Motion objects, and</p><p>— A method for generating and specifying
    an H-Anim motion capture animation.</p><p>This document specifies a standard technique
    for exchanging humanoid animation using motion capture. It does not mandate using
    any specific run-time system to render the H-Anim characters or animations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>"
