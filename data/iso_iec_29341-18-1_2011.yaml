abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 629431-18-1:2011(E) describes an architecture that provides the
    infrastructure that allows generic UPnP devices, services and control points deployed
    in remote physical devices to interact with the corresponding UPnP devices, services
    and control points physically attached to the home network. The mechanisms defined
    in this architecture will allow to extend the home network so that it will logically
    include the remote devices so that all devices will be able to communicate among
    themselves using the UPnP Forum defined mechanisms, e.g. UDA. The desired behaviour
    of the interactions between the remote device and home devices is envisioned to
    be similar with the one expected as if all devices are located in the same local
    area network.
