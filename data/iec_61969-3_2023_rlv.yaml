abstract:
- content: "IEC 61969-3:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61969-3:2023
    specifies a set of basic environmental requirements and tests, as well as safety
    aspects for outdoor enclosures for electrical and electronic equipment, under
    conditions of non-weatherprotected locations above ground. The purpose of this
    document is to define a minimum level of environmental performance in order to
    meet requirements of storage, transport and final installation. The intention
    is to establish basic environmental performance criteria for outdoor enclosure
    compliance."
