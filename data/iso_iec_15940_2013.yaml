abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15940:2013 aims to update ISO/IEC 15940:2006 to take into account
    the changes of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and to add/complete the set of Software Engineering
    Environment services for software and system processes.Software engineering environments
    services, or SEE services, refers to a collection of services, partially or fully
    automated by software tools, that are used to support the execution of human activities
    in systems and software engineering.ISO/IEC 12207:2008 describes a comprehensive
    set of processes, activities and tasks to be performed when acquiring or developing
    a system/software. It does not address their implementation or their automation.
    These activities are usually carried out within a software or system development/maintenance
    project, and cover such areas as the specification, development, re-engineering
    or maintenance of systems.ISO/IEC 15940:2013 describes SEE services and relates
    them to ISO/IEC 12207:2008 in a manner applicable to a range of organizations.
    In defining a life cycle process for an organization, the user needs to find the
    appropriate level of automation provided by a software engineering environment.
    This may result in establishing a new SEE service or improving an existing one.The
    suite of SEE services described supports the process definitions in ISO/IEC 12207:2008.
    The purpose is to define a set of SEE services that are compatible with ISO/IEC
    12207:2008, and that can be used either as a general reference, or to define an
    automated software and system process.
