  content: "IEC TS 62804-2:2022 defines apparatus and procedures to test and evaluate
    the durability of photovoltaic (PV) modules to power loss by the effects of high
    voltage stress in a damp heat environment, referred to as potential-induced degradation
    (PID). This document defines a test method that compares the coulomb transfer
    between the active cell circuit and ground through the module packaging under
    voltage stress during accelerated stress testing with the coulomb transfer during
    outdoor testing to determine an acceleration factor for the PID.<br />\r\nThis
    document tests for the degradation mechanisms involving mobile ions influencing
    the electric field over the semiconductor absorber layer or electronically interacting
    with the films such that module power is affected."
