    <p>ISO/IEC 24730-2 is comprised of a main document and two additional parts, ISO/IEC 24730-21 and ISO/IEC 24730-22, and defines a networked location system that provides X-Y coordinates and data telemetry. The system utilizes real-time locating systems (RTLS) transmitters that autonomously generate a direct sequence spread spectrum radio frequency beacon. These devices can be field programmable and support an optional exciter mode that allows modification of the rate of location update and location of the RTLS device. ISO/IEC 24730-2 defines these modes, but does not define the means by which they are accomplished. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24730-21:2012 specifies transmitters operating with a single spread code and employing a differential binary phase shift keying (DBPSK) data encoding and binary phase shift keying (BPSK) spreading scheme.</p>
