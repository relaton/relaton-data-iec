abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21778:2017 JSON is a lightweight, text-based, language-independent syntax for
    defining data interchange formats. It was derived from the ECMAScript programming
    language, but is programming language independent. JSON defines a small set of
    structuring rules for the portable representation of structured data.<br />\r\nThe
    goal of ISO/IEC 21778:2017 is only to define the syntax of valid JSON texts. Its
    intent is not to provide any semantics or interpretation of text conforming to
    that syntax. It also intentionally does not define how a valid JSON text might
    be internalized into the data structures of a programming language. There are
    many possible semantics that could be applied to the JSON syntax and many ways
    that a JSON text can be processed or mapped by a programming language. Meaningful
    interchange of information using JSON requires agreement among the involved parties
    on the specific semantics to be applied. Defining specific semantic interpretations
    of JSON is potentially a topic for other specifications. Similarly, language mappings
    of JSON can also be independently specified. For example, ECMA-262 defines mappings
    between valid JSON texts and ECMAScript's runtime data structures."
