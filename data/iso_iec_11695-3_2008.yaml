abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11695 is one of a series of International Standards defining the
    parameters for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage
    and interchange of digital data. ISO/IEC 11695 is specific to optical memory cards
    using the holographic recording method.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 11695-3:2008 specifies
    the optical properties and characteristics of optical memory cards using the holographic
    recording method."
