abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23005-5:2016 specifies syntax and semantics of the data formats
    for interaction devices, i.e. Device Commands and Sensed Information, required
    for providing interoperability in controlling interaction devices and in sensing
    information from interaction devices in real as well as virtual worlds as depicted
    in Figure 1.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23005-5:2016 aims to provide data formats for industry-ready
    interaction devices: sensors and actuators. The same data formats for interaction
    devices can be utilized by various applications supported by different MPEG technologies.
    Not only this International Standard but also other International Standards such
    as ISO/IEC 23007 (MPEG-U) and scene representation specifications (for example
    ISO/IEC 14496-20) can simply refer to this part of ISO/IEC 23005 to use the defined
    data formats.</p><p>Two cases can occur for controlling a virtual world by using
    the MPEG tools. When the virtual world is using a scene description defined by
    MPEG tools (BIFS, Laser, etc.), the sensors and actuators can be directly connected
    to it through an MPEG-U interface. When the virtual world is defined by non MPEG
    tools, an adaptation engine and common formalism for effects are needed. In Figure
    1, the first case is illustrated by VirtualWorld2 and the second by VirtualWorld1.</p><p>When
    this part of ISO/IEC 23005 is used in the context of pure ISO/IEC 23005, the adaptation
    engine (RV or VR engine), which is not within the scope of standardization, performs
    bi-directional communications using data formats specified in this part of ISO/IEC
    23005. The adaptation engine can also utilize other tools defined in ISO/IEC 23005-2,
    which are user's sensory preferences (USP), sensory device capabilities (SDC),
    sensor capabilities (SC), and sensor adaptation preferences (SAP) for fine controls
    of devices in both real and virtual worlds.</p><p>On the other hand, the defined
    data formats (Sensed Information and Device Command) can be mapped to MPEG-U defined
    interfaces when this part of ISO/IEC 23005 is utilized in the context of other
    standards such as MPEG-U Framework. For example, the interface can be provided
    as ISO/IEC 23007-2 in the context of MPEG-U. Also defined, Sensed Information
    can be used by scene representation specifications as input data formats for a
    scene. The Device Command data format can also be used as output data formats
    to communicate with the outer world by mapping onto the interfaces defined in
    specific specifications.</p>"
