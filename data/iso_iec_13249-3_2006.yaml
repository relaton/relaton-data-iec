abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 13249-3:2006 defines spatial user-defined types, routines and
    schemas for generic spatial data handling. It addresses the need to store, manage
    and retrieve information based on aspects of spatial data such as geometry, location
    and topology.<br /><br />\r\nImplementations of ISO/IEC 13249-3:2006 may exist
    in environments that also support geographic information, decision support, data
    mining, and data warehousing systems. Application areas addressed by implementations
    of ISO/IEC 13249-3:2006 include, but are not restricted to, automated mapping,
    desktop mapping, facilities management, geoengineering, graphics, location based
    services, multimedia, and resource management applications."
