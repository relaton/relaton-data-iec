abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62471-2:2009(E) provides the basis for optical radiation safety
    requirements of non-laser products, serving as a guide for development of safety
    requirements in vertical product standards and assisting lamp system manufacturers
    in the interpretation of safety information provided by the lamp manufacturers.
    This report provides guidance on:<br />\r\n- requirements for optical radiation
    safety assessment;<br />\r\n- allocation of safety measures;<br />\r\n- labelling
    of products.<br />\r\nThis technical report does not address safety requirements
    of intentional exposure to optical radiation from sun tanning equipment, ophthalmic
    instruments or other medical/cosmetic devices whose specific safety issues are
    addressed through appropriate standards."
