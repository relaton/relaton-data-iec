  content: "IEC TS 60825-20:2025 provides radiation safety requirements (normative)
    and guidelines (informative) for the consideration of faults for Class 1 laser
    devices with laser radiation directed towards the eyes or face. Requirements for
    the safety of the nominal emission are not in the scope of this document.<br />\r\nExamples:<br
    />\r\n− devices with laser light facial or ocular recognition;<br />\r\n− virtual
    reality headsets or glasses;<br />\r\n− devices with gesture tracking via eye
    or facial movements;<br />\r\n− driver surveillance cameras;<br />\r\n− full body
    scanners (including eyes, face, and body).<br />\r\nProducts exempted from this
    document include:<br />\r\n− medical and ophthalmic devices;<br />\r\n− automotive
    (lidars), lamps;<br />\r\n− laser applications where the laser is used in a professional
    (non-consumer) setting and is intended for direct or long-time exposure of the
    eyes or face.<br />\r\nThis document provides normative requirements and informative
    guidelines for:<br />\r\n− radiation safety analysis;<br />\r\n− production-line
    testing;<br />\r\n− hazard analysis for laser radiation emissions (using a modified
    safety-focused FMEA approach)<br />\r\nNOTE all subsequent references to FMEA
    in this document refers to this safety-focused FMEA approach.<br />\r\n− examples
    of typical failure modes and mitigation techniques"
