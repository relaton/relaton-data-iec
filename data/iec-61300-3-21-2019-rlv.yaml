  content: "IEC 61300-3-21:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-21:2019
    describes a method to measure the switching time and related performance parameters
    of a fibre optic spatial switch when the actuation energy is applied or removed
    to change the state of the switch. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- changes to remove redundant overlap with IEC
    60876-1;<br />\r\n- clarifications to definitions and diagrams;<br />\r\n- generalization
    of the detection apparatus beyond an oscilloscope.<br />\r\nKeywords: switching
    time, performance parameters of a fibre optic spatial switch, actuation energy"
