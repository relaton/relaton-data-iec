  content: 'Applies to the methods for measuring the effective area of single mode
    optical fibres. Three methods of measuring effective area are found in the body
    of the document. The three methods are: direct far-field (DFF);variable aperture
    in the far-field (VAMFF); near-field (NF). The reference method, used to resolve
    disputes, is method A, direct far-field.'
