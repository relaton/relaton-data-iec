abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard applies to implementation and application
    of test charts for colour copying machines.</p><p>This International Standard
    serves for testing of reproduction properties of colour copying machines, in order
    to help</p><p>to recognize the possibilities and limits of various machines and
    for their comparison.</p><p>To use this International Standard, make copies of
    at least two test charts (one achromatic and one chromatic) out of</p><p>eight
    test charts using the device to be tested. The resulting copies shall be examined
    visually and may be</p><p>compared with the original test charts. Objective measurements
    may be made for these copies.</p><p>Eight ISO-test charts, four in halftone (offset
    reproduction) and four in continuous tone (photographic reproduction),</p><p>belonging
    to this International Standard may be produced by different manufacturers. Information
    about where to</p><p>obtain test chart layout and colorimetric L*a*b* data to
    produce the charts may be found in Annex M.</p><p>All hard copy patterns (analog
    test charts) produced according to this International Standard should be discarded</p><p>after
    three years.</p>"
