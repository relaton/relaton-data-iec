abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 13719 specifies PCTE in abstract, programming-language-independent,
    terms. It specifies the interface supported by any conforming implementation as
    a set of abstract operation specifications, together with the types of their parameters
    and results. It is supported by a number of standard bindings, i.e. representations
    of the interface in standard programming languages.</p><p>The scope of this part
    of ISO/IEC 13719 is restricted to a single PCTE installation. It does not specify
    the means of communication between PCTE installations, nor between a PCTE installation
    and another system.</p><p> A number of features are not completely defined in
    this part of ISO/IEC 13719, some freedom being allowed to the implementor. Some
    of these are implementation limits, for which constraints are defined (see clause
    24). The other implementation-dependent and implementation-defined features are
    specified in the appropriate places in this Standard.</p><p>PCTE is an interface
    to a set of facilities that forms the basis for constructing environments supporting
    systems engineering projects. These facilities are designed particularly to provide
    an infrastructure for programs which may be part of such environments. Such programs,
    which are used as aids to systems development, are often referred to as tools.</p><p>This
    part of ISO/IEC 13719 also includes (in annex B) a language standard for the PCTE
    Data Description Language (DDL), suitable for writing PCTE schema definition sets.</p>"
