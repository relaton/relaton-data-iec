- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of an 80 mm and a 120 mm
    DVD -</p><p>Recordable disk to enable the interchange of such disks. It specifies
    the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and the</p><p>recorded signals, the
    format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format of the unrecorded
    zone, and the</p><p>recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD -</p><p>Recordable (DVD-R)
    disk. Once data has been recorded on a DVD-R disk it cannot be modified. It can
    be read many times.</p><p>Further data may be appended.</p><p>This International
    Standard specifies</p><p>? 80 mm and 120 mm nominal diameter disks that may be
    either single or double sided,</p><p>? the conditions for conformance,</p><p>?
    the environments in which the disk is to be operated and stored,</p><p>? the mechanical
    and physical characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    between data processing</p><p>systems,</p><p>? the format of the pre-recorded
    information on an unrecorded disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks
    and</p><p>sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method used,</p><p>?
    the format of the data and the recorded information on the disk, including the
    physical disposition of the tracks and sectors,</p><p>the error correcting codes
    and the coding method used,</p><p>? the characteristics of the signals from pre-recorded
    and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data processing systems to</p><p>read
    the pre-recorded information and to write to the disks,</p><p>? the characteristics
    of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read
    the data from the disk.</p><p>This International Standard provides for interchange
    of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file</p><p>structure,
    it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
