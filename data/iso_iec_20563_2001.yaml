abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and
    optical characteristics of an 80 mm and a 120 mm DVD -</p><p>Recordable disk to
    enable the interchange of such disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded,
    unrecorded and the</p><p>recorded signals, the format of the data, the format
    of the information zone, the format of the unrecorded zone, and the</p><p>recording
    method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. This
    disk is identified as a DVD -</p><p>Recordable (DVD-R) disk. Once data has been
    recorded on a DVD-R disk it cannot be modified. It can be read many times.</p><p>Further
    data may be appended.</p><p>This International Standard specifies</p><p>? 80 mm
    and 120 mm nominal diameter disks that may be either single or double sided,</p><p>?
    the conditions for conformance,</p><p>? the environments in which the disk is
    to be operated and stored,</p><p>? the mechanical and physical characteristics
    of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing</p><p>systems,</p><p>?
    the format of the pre-recorded information on an unrecorded disk, including the
    physical disposition of the tracks and</p><p>sectors, the error correcting codes
    and the coding method used,</p><p>? the format of the data and the recorded information
    on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors,</p><p>the
    error correcting codes and the coding method used,</p><p>? the characteristics
    of the signals from pre-recorded and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data
    processing systems to</p><p>read the pre-recorded information and to write to
    the disks,</p><p>? the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling
    data processing systems to read the data from the disk.</p><p>This International
    Standard provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with
    a standard for volume and file</p><p>structure, it provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems.</p>"
