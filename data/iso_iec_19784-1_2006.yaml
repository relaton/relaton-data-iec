abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19784-1:2006 provides a defined interface that allows a software
    application to communicate with (utilize the services of) one or more biometric
    technologies. It includes a high-level generic biometric authentication model
    suited to a broad range of biometrically enabled applications and to most forms
    of biometric technology. An architectural model is described which enables components
    of a biometric system to be provided by different vendors, and to interwork through
    fully-defined Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), corresponding Service
    Provider Interfaces (SPIs), and associated data structures. ISO/IEC 19784-1:2006
    covers the basic biometric functions of enrollment, verification and identification,
    and includes a database interface to allow an application to manage the storage
    of biometric records. Conformance requirements are identified and informative
    annexes, including sample code, are provided. ISO/IEC 19784-1:2006 specifies a
    biometric data structure which is compatible with ISO/IEC 19785 and 19794.</p>"
