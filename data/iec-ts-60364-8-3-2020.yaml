  content: "IEC TS 60364-8-3:2020 (E) specifies requirements and recommendations for
    the safe and proper functioning of prosumers' electrical installations.<br />\r\nIt
    is intended for use by contractors, users, facility managers and similar of electrical
    low-voltage installations.<br />\r\nThis document also provides requirements and
    recommendations on technical parameters and their limiting values influencing:<br
    />\r\na) safety:<br />\r\n– protection;<br />\r\n– alarm;<br />\r\nb) proper functioning:<br
    />\r\n– stability (voltage, frequency, etc);<br />\r\n– reliability (power quality,
    interoperability of communication, etc);<br />\r\n– energy management (power,
    power factor, current, stored energy, etc);<br />\r\n– ability to ensure correct
    operation of equipment.<br />\r\nThis document also provides requirements and
    recommendations on data exchange models, and test procedures for the prosumer’s
    electrical installations that could include the following applications:<br />\r\n–
    local generating sources (e.g. photovoltaic systems, rotating generators, wind
    turbines);<br />\r\n– energy storage units (e.g. stationary secondary batteries);<br
    />\r\n– electric vehicle charging and/or discharging;<br />\r\n– prosumer’s energy
    measurement unit (PEMU);<br />\r\n– control and monitoring system;<br />\r\n–
    loads which can be controlled.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 60364 is intended to
    be applied in conjunction with the other parts of IEC 60364."
