  content: Describes, with examples, statistical methods to analyze times to break
    down and breakdown voltage data obtained from electrical testing of solid insulating
    materials, for purposes including characterization of the system, comparison with
    another insulator system, and prediction of the probability of breakdown at given
    times or voltages.
