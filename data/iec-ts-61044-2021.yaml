  content: "IEC TS 61044:2021(E) covers opportunity charging of lead-acid traction
    batteries, i.e., the use of idle time during a working period to increase the
    state of charge (SoC) so as to extend the daily working period of a lead-acid
    traction battery while at the same time avoiding an excessive depth of discharge.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies requirements for the use of opportunity charging
    of lead-acid traction batteries of vented and valve regulated types when the battery
    manufacturer has not provided alternative specific operating procedures."
