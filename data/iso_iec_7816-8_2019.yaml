- content: "<p>This document specifies interindustry commands which can be used for
    security operations. This document also provides informative directives on how
    to construct security mechanisms with commands defined in ISO/IEC 7816â€‘4.</p><p>The
    choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanism in security operations
    can affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of algorithms
    and protocols is outside the scope of this document. It does not cover the internal
    implementation within the card and/or the outside world.</p>"
