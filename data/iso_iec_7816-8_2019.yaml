abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 7816-8:2019 This document specifies interindustry commands which
    can be used for security operations. This document also provides informative directives
    on how to construct security mechanisms with commands defined in ISO/IEC 7816â€‘4.<br
    />\r\nThe choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanism in security
    operations can affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of
    algorithms and protocols is outside the scope of this document. It does not cover
    the internal implementation within the card and/or the outside world."
