abstract:
- content: "This document introduces the effects of population demographics on biometric
    functions. It:<br />\r\n- establishes terms and definitions relevant to the study
    of demographic factors in biometric recognition system performance;<br />\r\n-
    identifies areas where biometric systems can exhibit different performances based
    on different demographic factors of the individuals submitting the biometric samples;<br
    />\r\n- explains how different demographic factors can influence the biometric
    characteristics captured by different biometric modalities and how these influences
    can affect biometric performance measures;<br />\r\n- presents a case study on
    existing scientific material that explores the impact of demographic factors on
    biometric system performance. Only biometric modalities where quantitative information
    is available on the impact of demographic factors are considered.<br />\r\nOutside
    of the scope of this document are:<br />\r\n- effects of disease and injury on
    biometric performance; and<br />\r\n- how religious and cultural norms can affect
    biometric operations."
