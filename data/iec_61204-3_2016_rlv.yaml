abstract:
- content: "IEC 61204-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61204-3:2016 specifies
    the electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) requirements for switch mode power supply
    (SMPS) units supplied by source voltages up to 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC providing
    AC and/or DC output(s), except inverter output(s) establishing AC mains. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the title has been changed by deleting the wording
    \"DC output-\" from the title and adding \"switch mode\" in the title;<br />\r\nb)
    changes in the scope: 1.1.1 Equipment covered by this document;<br />\r\nc) update
    of the normative references to the latest editions or dated references;<br />\r\nd)
    change of wording or/and notes regarding the requirements of CENELEC Guide 24
    and IEC Guide 107;<br />\r\ne) revision of the emission limits to align with the
    latest editions of the applicable normative references;<br />\r\nf) revision of
    the immunity requirements to align with the latest editions of the applicable
