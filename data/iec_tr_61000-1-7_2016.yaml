abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-1-7:2016(E) provides definitions of various electrical power
    quantities and the relationship between them under non-sinusoidal conditions,
    in order to give clear information on both components in the power factor:&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- the fundamental power factor, which is due to the phase difference
    between the voltage and current at the fundamental frequency, and&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n-
    the non-fundamental power factor, which is related to the distortion of the voltage
    and&#x2F;or current. This Technical Report is applicable only to single-phase
    systems."
