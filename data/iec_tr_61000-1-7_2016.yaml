abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-1-7:2016(E) provides definitions of various electrical power
    quantities and the relationship between them under non-sinusoidal conditions,
    in order to give clear information on both components in the power factor:\r\n-
    the fundamental power factor, which is due to the phase difference between the
    voltage and current at the fundamental frequency, and\r\n- the non-fundamental
    power factor, which is related to the distortion of the voltage and&#x2F;or current.
    This Technical Report is applicable only to single-phase systems."
