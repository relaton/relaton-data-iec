  content: IEC 60747-5-9:2019(E) specifies the measuring method of the internal quantum
    efficiency (IQE) of single light emitting diode (LED) chips or packages without
    phosphor. White LEDs for lighting applications are out of the scope of this document.
    This document utilizes the relative external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) measured
    at cryogenic temperatures and at an operating temperature, which is called temperature-dependent
    electroluminescence (TDEL). In order to identify the reference IQE of 100 %, the
    maximum values of the peak EQE are found by varying the environmental temperature
    and current.
