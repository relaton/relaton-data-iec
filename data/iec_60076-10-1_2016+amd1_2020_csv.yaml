abstract:
- content: "IEC 60076-10-1:2016+A1:2020 provides supporting information to help both
    manufacturers and purchasers to apply the measurement techniques described in
    IEC 60076-10. Besides the introduction of some basic acoustics, the sources and
    characteristics of transformer and reactor sound are described. Practical guidance
    on making measurements is given, and factors influencing the accuracy of the methods
    are discussed. This application guide also indicates why values measured in the
    factory may differ from those measured in service. This application guide is applicable
    to transformers and reactors together with their associated cooling auxiliaries.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) extended information on sound fields provided;<br
    />\r\nb) effect of current harmonics in windings enfolded;<br />\r\nc) updated
    information on measuring methods sound pressure and sound intensity given;<br
    />\r\nd) supporting information on measuring procedures walk-around and point-by-point
    given;<br />\r\ne) clarification of A-weighting provided;<br />\r\nf) new information
    on frequency bands given;<br />\r\ng) background information on measurement distance
    provided;<br />\r\nh) new annex on sound-built up due to harmonic currents in
    windings introduced.<br /><strong>This consolidated version consists of the second
    edition (2016) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.</strong>"
