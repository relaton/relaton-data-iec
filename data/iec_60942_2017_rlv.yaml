abstract:
- content: "IEC 60942:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60942:2017 specifies
    the performance requirements for three classes of sound calibrator: class LS (Laboratory
    Standard), class 1 and class 2. Acceptance limits are smallest for class LS and
    greatest for class 2 instruments. Class LS sound calibrators are normally used
    only in the laboratory; class 1 and class 2 are considered as sound calibrators
    for field use. A class 1 sound calibrator is primarily intended for use with a
    class 1 sound level meter and a class 2 sound calibrator primarily with a class
    2 sound level meter, as specified in IEC 61672-1. The acceptance limits for class
    LS sound calibrators are based on the use of a laboratory standard microphone,
    as specified in IEC 61094-1, for demonstrations of conformance to the requirements
    of this document. The acceptance limits for class 1 and class 2 sound calibrators
    are based on the use of a working standard microphone, as specified in IEC 61094-4,
    for demonstrations of conformance to the requirements of this document. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2003, of which it
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) deletion of
    the class designations, class LS/C, class 1/C and class 2/C;<br />\r\nb) addition
    of two further class designations, class LS/M and class 1/M, specifically for
    pistonphones;<br />\r\nc) addition of an amended criterion for assessing conformance
    to a specification: conformance is now demonstrated when (a) measured deviations
    from design goals do not exceed the applicable acceptance limits and (b) the uncertainty
    of measurement does not exceed the corresponding maximum-permitted uncertainty;<br
    />\r\nd) modification to the short-term level fluctuation test of the sound pressure
    level stability;<br />\r\ne) change to some environmental test conditions to avoid
    icing;<br />\r\nf) addition of an alternative test for immunity to radio-frequency
    fields using transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waveguides.</p>"
