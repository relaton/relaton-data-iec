abstract:
- content: "IEC 60684-3-247:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-247:2019
    gives the requirements for two types of heat-shrinkable, polyolefin sleeving,
    dual wall, not flame retarded with a nominal shrink ratio of 3:1. This sleeving
    has been found suitable for use at temperatures of up to 100 °C.<br />\r\n- Type
    A: Medium wall, internal diameter up to 200,0 mm typically.<br />\r\n- Type B:
    Thick wall, internal diameter up to 200,0 mm typically.<br />\r\nThese sleevings
    are normally supplied in colour black. Since these types of sleving cover a significantly
    large range of sizes and wall thicknesses, Annex A (Tables A.1 and A.2) provides
    a guide to the range of sizes available. The actual size will be agreed between
    the user and supplier. Materials which conform to this specification meet established
    levels of performance. However, the selection of a material by a user for a specific
    application will be based on the actual requirements necessary for adequate performance
    in that application and not based on this specification alone. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2011 and Amendment 1:2016.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous editions:<br />\r\n-
    removal of the colour fastness to light test, as this is covered by the test for
    carbon black content;<br />\r\n- change of low temperature flexibility test to
    -20 °C to align with sheet 214;<br />\r\n- change of final conditioning temperature
    of peel strength samples to 200 ºC to align with the temperature in Clause 5;<br
    />\r\n- removal of the fungus resistance test as there is no evidence that fungus
    growth is an issue either by testing or in use.<br />\r\nKeywords: Heat-shrinkable,
    polyolefin sleeving, dual wall, not flame retarded, thick and medium wall"
