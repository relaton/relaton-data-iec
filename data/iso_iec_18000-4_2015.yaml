abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18000-4:2015 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 2,45 GHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM)
    band used in item management applications. It provides a common technical specification
    for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing RFID application
    standards. It is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability
    of products for the growing RFID market in the international marketplace. It defines
    the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes including, but
    not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy, occupied channel
    bandwidth, maximum equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP), spurious emissions,
    modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission
    order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence,
    spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines the communications protocol
    used in the air interface.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 18000-4:2015 contains the following
    three modes: Mode 1 is an interrogator talks first with passive tag; Mode 2 is
    a tag talks first with battery-assisted passive tag; Mode 3 is a globally available,
    ubiquitous network supporting, among others, the logistics and transportation
    industry; agnostic to any device, commercial or otherwise, requiring global availability.<br
    />\r\nThe detailed technical differences between the modes are shown in the parameter
    tables."
