abstract:
- content: In biometric performance testing and reporting, careful consideration needs
    to be given to the characteristic differences of each modality (fingerprint, face,
    iris, etc.). These differences naturally require variations within the general
    methodology defined in ISO/IEC 19795-1.  ISO/IEC TR 19795-3:2007 describes the
    methodologies relating to these modality-dependent variations. It presents and
    defines methods for determining, given a specific biometric modality, how to develop
    a technical performance test.
