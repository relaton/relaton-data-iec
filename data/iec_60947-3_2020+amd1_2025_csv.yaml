abstract:
- content: "IEC 60947-3:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV applies to switches, disconnectors, switch-disconnectors
    and fuse-combination units and their dedicated accessories to be used in distribution
    circuits and motor circuits of which the rated voltage does not exceed 1 000 V
    AC or 1 500 V DC. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2008, Amendment 1:2012 and Amendment 2:2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of critical load current
    tests for DC switches (see 9.3.9);<br />\r\n- addition of requirements for a conditional
    short-circuit rating for disconnectors, switches, and switch-disconnectors protected
    by circuit-breakers (see 9.3.7.2);<br />\r\n- addition of new categories for high-efficiency
    motors switching (see Annex A);<br />\r\n- addition of new Annex E for connection
    to aluminium conductors;<br />\r\n- addition of new Annex F for power losses measurement.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of October 2021 have been included in this
    copy."
