abstract:
- content: Defines integer and floating point data types (bounded, unbounded, and
    modulo integer types as well as normalized and denormalized floating point types)
    on computer systems and their properties to ensure that the processing of arithmetic
    data can be undertaken in a reliable and predictable manner. The requirements
    given shall be in addition to those that may be specified in other standards,
    e.g. those for programming languages.
