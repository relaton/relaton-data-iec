abstract:
- content: "Specifies requirements and related tests for programmable controllers
    (PLC) and their associated peripherals (for example, programming and debugging
    tools (PADTs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), etc.) which have as their intended
    use the control and command of machines and industrial processes.The object is\nto
    establish the definitions and identify the principal characteristics relevant
    to the selection and application of PLCs and their associated peripherals and
    \nto specify the minimum requirements for functional, electrical, mechanical,
    environmental and construction characteristics, service conditions, safety, EMC,
    user programming and tests applicable to PLCs and the associated peripherals."
