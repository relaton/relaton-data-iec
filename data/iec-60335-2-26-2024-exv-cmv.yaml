  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-26:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-26:2024 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-26:2024 deals with the safety of electric clocks having
    a rated voltage not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances that are within
    the scope of this standard are<br />\r\n– alarm clocks;<br />\r\n– spring-driven
    clocks with an electrically operated winding mechanism;<br />\r\n– clocks incorporating
    driving means other than motors.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– clocks having other functions, whether or not
    in combination with time indication, such as master control clocks and timers
    for cooking ranges, washing machines and similar appliances;<br />\r\n– clocks
    for \"clocking-in\" purposes;<br />\r\n– clocks incorporating electronic circuits
    only (IEC 60065, IEC 62368-1);<br />\r\n– watches.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition
    cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2002 and Amendment 1: 2008.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) application of test probe 19 (8.1.1,
    20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) introduction of limits on the temperature rise
    of external accessible surfaces (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
