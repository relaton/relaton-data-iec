abstract:
- content: IEC 60076-21:2011/IEEE Std C57.15:2009 - Description of design types, tables
    of 50 Hz and 60 Hz ratings, supplementary ratings, construction, and available
    accessories are provided. Methods for performing routine and design tests applicable
    to liquid-immersed single and three-phase step-voltage regulators are described.
    Winding resistance measurements, polarity tests, insulation power factor and resistance
    tests, ratio tests, no load loss and excitation current measurements, impedance
    and load loss measurements, dielectric tests, temperature tests, routine and design
    impulse tests, short-circuit tests, control tests, calculated data, and certified
    test data are covered.
