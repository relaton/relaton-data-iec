  content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This international standard, FC-AL-2, specifies an enhancement to the signaling
    protocol of the Fibre Channel Physical and Signalling Interface (FC-PH), ISO&#x2F;IEC
    14165-111, to support communication among two or more Ports without using the
    Fabric topology. It defines L_Ports that retain the functionality of Ports as
    specified in FC-PH. The Arbitrated Loop topology attaches multiple communicating
    points in a loop without requiring switches; it is a distributed topology where
    each L_Port includes the minimum necessary function to establish a Loop circuit.
    A single FL_Port connected to an Arbitrated Loop allows multiple NL_Ports to attach
    to a Fabric. Each L_Port may use a self-discovering procedure to find the correct
    operating mode without the need for external controls.
