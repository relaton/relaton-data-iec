  content: "IEC 61400-5:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies requirements to ensure the engineering
    integrity of wind turbine blades as well as an appropriate level of operational
    safety throughout the design lifetime. It includes requirements for:<br />\r\naerodynamic
    and structural design,<br />\r\n- material selection, evaluation and testing,<br
    />\r\n- manufacture (including associated quality management),<br />\r\n- transportation,
    installation, operation and maintenance of the blades.<br />\r\nThe purpose of
    this document is to provide a technical reference for designers, manufacturers,
    purchasers, operators, third party organizations and material suppliers, as well
    as to define requirements for certification."
