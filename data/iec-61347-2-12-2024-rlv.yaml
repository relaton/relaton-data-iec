  content: "IEC 61347-2-12:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61347-2-12:2024
    specifies safety requirements for electronic controlgear for use on AC supplies
    at 50 Hz or 60 Hz up to 1 000 V or DC supplies up to 1 000 V. The type of controlgear
    is a convertor that can contain igniting and stabilizing elements for operation
    of a discharge lamp under direct current or at a frequency that can deviate from
    the supply frequency.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2005 and Amendment 1:2010. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) introduction of dated references
    where appropriate;<br />\r\nb) clarification of sample item numbers;<br />\r\nc)
    addition of new information requirements (items v), w) and x) of IEC 61347-1:2015,
    7.1 and IEC 61347-1:2015/AMD1:2017, 7.1)."
