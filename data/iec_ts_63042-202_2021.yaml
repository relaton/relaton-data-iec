abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63042-202:2021(E) provides common rules for the design of overhead
    transmission lines with the highest voltages of AC transmission systems exceeding
    800 kV, so as to provide safety and proper functioning for the intended use.<br
    />\r\nThis technical specification aims to give the main principles for the design
    of UHV AC overhead transmission lines, mainly including selection of clearance,
    insulation coordination and insulator strings design, bundle-conductor selection,
    earth wire/optical ground wires selection, tower and foundation design, environmental
    consideration. The design criteria apply to new construction, reconstruction and
    expansion of UHV AC overhead transmission line."
