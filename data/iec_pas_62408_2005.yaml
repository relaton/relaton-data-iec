abstract:
- content: It extends  Ethernet according to the IEEE 802.3/ISO/IEC 8802-3 standard
    with mechanisms to transfer data with predictable timing and precise synchronisation.
    The communication profile meets timing demands typical for high-performance automation
    and motion applications. It does not change basic principles of the Fast Ethernet
    Standard IEEE 802.3 but extends it towards RTE. Thus it is possible to leverage
    and continue to use any standard Ethernet silicon, infrastructure component or
    test and measurement equipment like a network analyzer.
