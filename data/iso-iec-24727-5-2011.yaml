    <p>ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic services for multi-sector use.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24727-5:2011 specifies conformance testing procedures designed to determine if interfaces developed with the ISO/IEC 24727 series meet the requirement of ISO/IEC 24727. By conforming to ISO/IEC 24727-5:2011, interoperable implementations of ISO/IEC 24727 can be realized.</p>
    <p>Test procedures for ISO/IEC 24727-2, ISO/IEC 24727-3 and ISO/IEC 24727-4 are described with sufficient detailing in support of ISO/IEC 24727 interoperability requirements, i.e. the connectivity, ISO/IEC 24727 security mechanisms and discovery mechanisms between the client-application and the card-application. This part of ISO/IEC 24727 defines calls on ISO/IEC 24727-3 in an ordered sequence. It also defines the confirmation of integrity of transmitted data by an implementation under test, as well as the syntax of that data received from the implementation under test for the marshalling procedures defined in ISO/IEC 24727-3 and ISO/IEC 24727-4.</p>
    <p>For each test procedure, the conditions required for its execution are defined, along with the conditions under which it has to be executed and the expected results. Structures and entities used for the tests, as well as common set of recurring sequences used for the various procedures, are identified and documented in ISO/IEC 24727-5:2011.</p>
