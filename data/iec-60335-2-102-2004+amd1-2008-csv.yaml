  content: 'Deals with the safety of gas, oil and solid-fuel burning appliances having
    electrical connections, for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.
    The electrical safety and some other safety aspects of these appliances are also
    covered. All safety aspects are covered when the appliance also complies with
    the relevant standard for the fuel-burning appliance. If the appliance incorporates
    electric-heating sources, it also has to comply with the relevant part 2 of IEC
    60335. Examples of appliances within the scope of this standard are: central heating
    boilers; commercial catering equipment; cooking appliances; laundry and cleaning
    appliances; room heaters; warm air heaters; water heaters. This consolidated version
    consists of the first edition (2004) and its amendment 1 (2008). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.'
