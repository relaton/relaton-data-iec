    determines the screening attenuation as of metallic communication cable screens. Due to the concentric outer tube, measurements are independent of irregularities on the circumference and outer electromagnetic field.
    A wide dynamic and frequency range can be applied to test even super-screened cables with normal instrumentation from low frequencies up to the limit of defined transversal waves in the outer circuit at approximately 4 GHz.
