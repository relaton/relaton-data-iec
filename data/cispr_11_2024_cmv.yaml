abstract:
- content: "CISPR 11:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between CISPR 11:2024 edition 7.0 and the previous CISPR 11:2015+AMD1:2016+AMD2:2019
    CSV edition 6.2. Furthermore, comments from CISPR Subcommittee B experts are provided
    to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of
    the content.<br /><br />\r\nCISPR 11:2024 applies to industrial, scientific and
    medical electrical equipment operating in the frequency range 0 Hz to 400 GHz
    and to domestic and similar appliances designed to generate and/or use locally
    radio-frequency energy. This document covers emission requirements related to
    radio-frequency (RF) disturbances in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 400 GHz.
    For ISM RF applications in the meaning of the definition found in the ITU Radio
    Regulations (2020) (see Definition 3.1.18), this document covers emission requirements
    related to radio-frequency disturbances in the frequency range of 9 kHz to 18
    GHz. ISM equipment which incorporates radio transmit/receive functions (host equipment
    with radio functionality) is included in the scope of this document, see Annex
    F. However, the emission requirements in this document are not intended to be
    applicable to the intentional transmissions from a radio transmitter as defined
    by the ITU including their spurious emissions.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 This exclusion
    only applies to emissions from the intentional radio transmitter. However, combination
    emissions, for example emissions resulting from intermodulation between the radio
    and the non-radio subassemblies of the ISM equipment, are not subject to this
    exclusion.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Emission requirements for induction cooking appliances
    are specified in CISPR 14-1.<br />\r\nRequirements for ISM RF lighting equipment
    and UV irradiators operating at frequencies within the ISM frequency bands defined
    by the ITU Radio Regulations are contained in this document.<br />\r\nRobots used
    for industrial, scientific and medical applications are in the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nEXAMPLE Welding robots, spraying robots, handling robots, processing robots,
    assembly robots, medical robots, education and experimental robots. A comprehensive
    list of robots in the scope of this document is given on the IEC EMC zone.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 3 Flying robots, domestic helper robots, toy robots and entertainment
    robots are examples of robots in the scope of other CISPR standards.<br />\r\nEquipment
    covered by other CISPR product and product family emission standards are excluded
    from the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces
    the sixth edition published in 2015, Amendment 1:2016 and Amendment 2:2019. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    introduction of limits for radiated disturbances in the frequency range above
    1 GHz for group 1 equipment in line with the requirements given in the generic
    emission standards;<br />\r\nb) introduction of limits for conducted disturbances
    on the wired network port in line with the requirements given in the generic emission
    standards;<br />\r\nc) introduction of requirements for equipment which incorporates
    radio transmit/receive functions;<br />\r\nd) introduction of definitions for
    various types of robots;<br />\r\ne) consideration of some particular conditions
    when measuring robots, such as measurement setups and operating modes of robots."
