  content: IEC/TR 62627-03-01:2011(E) gives an example of the design of an acceptance
    test for ferrule style connectors when the dominant failure mode is fibre pistoning.
    The example applies to connectors which use epoxies or other adhesive polymers
    to bond the fibre into a ferrule. It combines existing evidence, mechanistic hypotheses
    and the demarcation approximation to develop an accelerated environmental exposure
    sequence that can be used on a pass-only basis to help ensure reliable service.
    This technical report was developed to serve only as an example of how accelerated
    acceptance tests can be designed. It is not intended as a normative standard for
    any specific application.
