abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61948-2:2019 is valid for single photon scintillation cameras with
    parallel hole collimators used in planar scintigraphy and tomography. It is also
    valid for the SPECT portion of SPECT/CT systems with parallel hole collimators,
    including the co-registration between the SPECT and CT subsystems. The objective
    is to specify ROUTINE TESTS for QUALITY CONTROL. Methods for the ACCEPTANCE TEST
    are described in IEC 61675-2.<br />\r\nIEC TR 61948-2:2019 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2001. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) adaptation to apply to the present technology;<br
    />\r\nb) updating of the test methods to comply with the recent state of the art."
