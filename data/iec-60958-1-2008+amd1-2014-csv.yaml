  script: Latn
  content: 'IEC 60958-1:2008+A1:2014 describes a serial, uni-directional, self-clocking
    interface for the interconnection of digital audio equipment for consumer and
    professional applications. It provides the basic structure of the interface. Separate
    documents define items specific to particular applications. The interface is primarily
    intended to carry monophonic or stereophonic programmes, encoded using linear
    PCM and with a resolution of up to 24 bits per sample. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2004 and constitutes a technical
    revision. It includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition: Electrical and optical requirements are removed from
    IEC 60958-3; they are specified in IEC 60958-1. <strong>This consolidated version
    consists of the third edition (2008) and its amendment 1 (2014). Therefore, no
    need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>'
