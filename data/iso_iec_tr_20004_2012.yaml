abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 20004:2012 refines the AVA_VAN assurance family activities defined
    in ISO/IEC 18045:2008 and provides more specific guidance on the identification,
    selection and assessment of relevant potential vulnerabilities in order to conduct
    an ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation of a software target of evaluation.ISO/IEC TR 20004:2012
    leverages the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and the Common Attack Pattern
    Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) to support the method of scoping and implementing
    ISO/IEC 18045:2008(E) vulnerability analysis activities.ISO/IEC TR 20004:2012
    does not define evaluator actions for certain high assurance ISO/IEC 15408 components,
    where there is as yet no generally agreed guidance.
