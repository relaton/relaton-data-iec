abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23005-6:2016 specifies syntax and semantics of the data types and
    tools common to the tools defined in the other parts of ISO/IEC 23005, such as
    basic data types which are used as basic building blocks in more than one of the
    tools in ISO/IEC 23005, colour-related basic types which are used in light and
    colour-related tools to help in specifying colour-related characteristics of the
    devices or commands, and time stamp types which can be used in device commands,
    and sensed information to specify timing related information.<p>Several classification
    schemes which are used in more than one part of ISO/IEC 23005 are also defined
    in Annex A. Other tools to be developed are included in this part of ISO/IEC 23005,
    if those tools are to be used with the tools defined in more than one part of
    ISO/IEC 23005. Most of the tools defined in this part are not intended to be used
    alone, but to be used as a part or as a supporting tool of other tools defined
    in other parts of ISO/IEC 23005.</p>
