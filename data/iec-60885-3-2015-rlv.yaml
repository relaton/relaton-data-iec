  content: "IEC 60885-3:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60885-3:2015 specifies
    the test methods for partial discharge (PD) measurements on lengths of extruded
    power cable, but does not include measurements made on installed cable systems.
    Reference is made to IEC 60270 which gives the techniques and considerations applicable
    to partial discharge measurements in general. This second edition of IEC 60885-3
    cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 1988 and constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The definition of sensitivity as twice
    the background noise level has been removed and replaced by a practical assessment
    of sensitivity based on the minimum level of detectable discharge.<br />\r\n-
    References to measurements of pulse heights in mm on an oscilloscope have been
    replaced by measurements of partial discharge magnitude in pC.<br />\r\n- The
    order of the clauses has been revised in line with the general numbering scheme
    of IEC standards and to provide clarity in order to facilitate its practical use.
    Section 3 of the first edition (Application guide) has been removed as it is considered
    that background information is better obtained from the original references as
    listed in the bibliography."
