  content: "Energy consumption will double between now and 2030, electricity demand
    will triple by 2050. Today, large amounts of energy are wasted. Proven, existing
    technologies can bring immediate savings of up to 30% with low hanging fruit in
    transportation, buildings, cooling and heating or industrial electrical motors.
    To reduce emissions and produce enough energy for developed and developing nations,
    the IEC believes that the whole energy chain will need to be rethought.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe publication identifies the challenges and outlines current and future
    technologies that will help improve energy efficiency. It provides insights into
    how the energy challenge needs to be addressed and includes recommendations for
    regulation and standardization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper was developed
    with CTOs (Chief Technology Officers) of major technology companies who participate
    in the <a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">IEC MSB</a> (Market Strategy Board) in
    cooperation with leading international experts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White
    Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/coping-energy-challenge-iecs-role-2010-2030\">free
    download</a>."
