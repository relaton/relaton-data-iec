  content: "IEC 61000-4-12:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-12:2017
    relates to the immunity requirements and test methods for electrical and electronic
    equipment, under operational conditions, to ring waves occurring in low-voltage
    power, control and signal lines supplied by public and non-public networks.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is to establish a common reference for evaluating
    the immunity of electrical and electronic equipment when subjected to ring waves.
    The test method documented in this part of IEC 61000 describes a consistent method
    to assess the immunity of an equipment or system against a defined phenomenon.<br
    />\r\nIt has the status of a basic EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide
    107.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of a mathematical modelling
    of ring wave waveform;<br />\r\nb) new Annex B on selection of generators and
    test levels;<br />\r\nc) new Annex C on explanatory notes;<br />\r\nd) new Annex
    D on measurement uncertainty;<br />\r\ne) addition of high speed CDN;<br />\r\nf)
    addition of a calibration procedure for CDN."
