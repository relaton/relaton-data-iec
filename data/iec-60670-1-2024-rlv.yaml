  content: "IEC 60670-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60670-1:2024
    applies to boxes, enclosures and parts of enclosures (hereafter called \"boxes\"
    and \"enclosures\") for electrical accessories with a rated voltage not exceeding
    1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC intended for household or similar fixed electrical installations,
    either indoors or outdoors. Boxes and enclosures complying with this document
    are suitable for use at ambient temperatures not normally exceeding +40 °C, but
    their average over a period of 24 h does not exceed +35 °C, with a lower limit
    of the ambient air temperature of −5 °C. Other temperatures outside the above
    range can apply according to the classification of the boxes and the enclosures.
    This document is intended to apply to boxes and enclosures for electrical accessories
    within the scope of IEC technical committee 23.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the classifications,
    markings and tests of boxes and enclosures for use and installation in ambient
    temperature below normal use are modified;<br />\r\nb) the test for the durability
    of markings is modified;<br />\r\nc) a test is added for fixing screws protected
    by caps;<br />\r\nd) a normative annex is added to specify the tests applied to
    boxes and enclosures declared with an IK code;<br />\r\ne) requirements for the
    resistance to abnormal heat and fire of internal parts not necessary to retain
    current carrying parts are specified."
