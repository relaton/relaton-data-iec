abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 describes an Abstract System Reference Model
    (ASRM) at the highest level first and</p><p>then creates a specific instance of
    this abstract model to define the DAVIC System Reference Model (DSRM).</p><p>The
    ASRM and DSRM are not intended to indicate preferred implementations of the DAVIC
    System; but are to</p><p>be used as a tool to guide the definition of DAVIC specifications.
    Additionally, as DAVIC specifications are</p><p>issued, the reference models can
    be used to aid the development and implementation of DAVIC-compliant</p><p>systems
    and products.</p>"
