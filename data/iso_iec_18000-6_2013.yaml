abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000-6:2013 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating in the 860 MHz to 960 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and
    Medical (ISM) band used in item management applications. It provides a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. It is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage
    inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international
    marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes
    including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy,
    occupied channel bandwidth, maximum effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP),
    spurious emissions, modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy,
    bit transmission order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency
    hop rate, hop sequence, spreading sequence, and chip rate. It further defines
    the communications protocol used in the air interface.ISO/IEC 18000-6:2013 together
    with ISO/IEC 18000-61, ISO/IEC 18000-62, ISO/IEC 18000-63 and ISO/IEC 18000-64
    specifies the physical and logical requirements for a passive-backscatter, Interrogator-Talks-First
    (ITF) or tag-only-talks-after-listening (TOTAL) RFID system. The system comprises
    Interrogators, also known as readers, and tags, also known as labels. An Interrogator
    receives information from a tag by transmitting a continuous-wave (CW) RF signal
    to the tag; the tag responds by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna,
    thereby backscattering an information signal to the Interrogator. The system is
    ITF, meaning that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information
    signal only after being directed to do so by an Interrogator, or TOTAL, meaning
    that a tag modulates its antenna reflection coefficient with an information signal
    upon entering an Interrogator's field after first listening for Interrogator modulation
    in order to determine if the system is ITF or not.ISO/IEC 18000-6:2013 contains
    one mode with four types. The detailed technical differences between the four
    types are shown in the associated parameter tables.Types A, B and C are ITF. Type
    A uses Pulse-Interval Encoding (PIE) in the forward link and an adaptive ALOHA
    collision-arbitration algorithm. Type B uses Manchester in the forward link and
    an adaptive binary-tree collision-arbitration algorithm. Type C uses PIE in the
    forward link and a random slotted collision-arbitration algorithm.Type D is TOTAL
    based on Pulse Position Encoding or Miller M=2 encoded subcarrier.
