abstract:
- content: IEC TR 60068-3-15:2024 describes vacuum-assisted soldering considering
    the thermal profiling, soldering methods, suitability of the components and vacuum
    features of soldering systems. It is based on practical experiences from manufacturers,
    component, material, and soldering systems suppliers. It supports manufacturers
    by providing information about the functionality of vacuum and effect of vacuum
    on components performance.
