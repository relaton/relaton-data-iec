abstract:
- content: "IEC 62317-12:2016(E) specifies the dimensions that are of importance for
    mechanical interchangeability for a preferred range of ring-cores, also called
    toroid cores, and the effective parameter values to be used in calculations involving
    them. The selection of core sizes for this document is based on the philosophy
    of including those sizes which are industrial standards, meaning that they are
    in broad-based use within industry. See IEC 62317-1 for more detail concerning
    the philosophy of selecting core sizes to be included. This first edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition of IEC TR 61604 published in 1997. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to IEC TR 61604:<br />\r\na) amendment of Clause
    5 concerning the relationship between standard of European, Japanese and U.S.A.
    sizes;<br />\r\nb) addition of Subclause 5.3 concerning coating."
