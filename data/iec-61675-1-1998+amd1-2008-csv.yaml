  content: Specifies terminology and test methods for declaring the characteristics
    of positron emission tomographs. Positron emission tomographs detect the annihilation
    radiation of positron emitting radionuclides by coincidence detection. It is intended
    that the test methods be carried out by the manufacturers, thereby enabling them
    to declare the characteristics of positron emission tomographs. So, the specifications
    given in the accompanying documents shall be in accordance with this standard.
    This consolidated version consists of the first edition (1998) and its amendment
    1 (2008). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.
