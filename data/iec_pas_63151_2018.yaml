abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 63151:2018(E) specifies protocols and test procedures for the
    reproducible measurement of the peak spatial-average specific absorption rate
    (psSAR) induced inside a simplified model of the head or the body by radio-frequency
    (RF) transmitting devices, with a defined uncertainty. It provides requirements
    for systems using vector measurement-based systems. Such systems determine the
    psSAR by 3D field reconstruction within the volume of interest by specifying the
    requirements for the measurement system, calibration, uncertainty assessment and
    validation methods. The protocols and procedures apply for a significant majority
    of people including children during use of hand-held and body-worn wireless communication
    devices.<br />\r\nThis PAS is applicable to any wireless communication device
    intended to be used at a position near the human head or body at distances up
    to and including 200 mm. This PAS can be employed to evaluate SAR compliance of
    different types of wireless communication devices used next to the ear, in front
    of the face, mounted on the body, combined with other RF-transmitting or non-transmitting
    devices or accessories (e.g. belt-clip), or embedded in garments. The overall
    applicable frequency range is from 30 MHz to 6 GHz.<br />\r\nThe system validation
    procedures provided within this PAS cover frequencies from 600 MHz to 6 GHz.<br
    />\r\nSome specifications (e.g., validation antennas and other procedures or requirements)
    are not yet defined over the full frequency range within the scope of this document
    but will be included in a future revision.<br />\r\nThe device categories covered
    include but are not limited to mobile telephones, cordless microphones, auxiliary
    broadcast devices and radio transmitters in personal computers, desktop, laptop
    devices, multi-band, multi-antenna, and push-to-talk devices."
