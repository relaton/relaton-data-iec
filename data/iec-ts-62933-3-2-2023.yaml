  content: "IEC TS 62933-3-2:2023 provides the requirements for power intensive and
    renewable energy sources integration related applications of EES systems, including
    grid integration, performance indicators, sizing and planning, operation and control,
    monitoring and maintenance. The power intensive applications of EES systems are
    usually used to improve the dynamic performance of the grid by discharging or
    charging based on corresponding control strategies. The renewable energy sources
    integration related applications of EES systems are usually used to mitigate short-term
    fluctuation and/or to keep long-term stability. This document includes the following
    applications of EES systems:<br />\r\n– frequency regulation/support;<br />\r\n–
    grid voltage support (Q(U)) (“volt/var support”);<br />\r\n– voltage sag mitigation;<br
    />\r\n– renewable energy sources integration related applications;<br />\r\n–
    power oscillation damping (POD)."
