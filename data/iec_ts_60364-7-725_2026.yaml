abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60364-7-725:2026 provides additional requirements for the design,
    erection and verification of electrical installations applicable for resilient
    power supply systems that must be operational in a time of disaster. It specifies
    additional requirements for<br />\r\n– generating sets,<br />\r\n– a circuit concerning
    external generating sets, and<br />\r\n– circuits of an installation to be supplied<br
    />\r\nso as to prevent or limit the effects of a natural disaster such as<br />\r\n–
    earthquake,<br />\r\n– flood damage, or<br />\r\n– wind hazard (e.g. tropical
    cyclone such as hurricane, typhoon)."
