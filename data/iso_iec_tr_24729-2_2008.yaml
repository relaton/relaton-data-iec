abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24729-2:2008 describes the potential for use of radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) as a significant enabler in the recycling of various types
    of products; notably home appliances and electronics. It identifies various recycling
    streams that are challenged by the possibility of RF tags being attached to recycled
    material, notably glass and steel.</p>"
