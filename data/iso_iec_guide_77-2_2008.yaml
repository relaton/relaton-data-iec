abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC Guide 77 provides general advice and guidance for the description
    of products and their characteristics by the use of the ISO 13584 and IEC 61360
    series of standards for the creation of computer-processable reference dictionaries.
    This description will provide the details of the products and their properties
    in an unambiguous manner capable of computer communication, in a form that is
    independent from any proprietary application software.ISO/IEC Guide 77 is intended
    to assist the objective of enabling the flow of technical information between
    internal and external business partners in a cost-effective and timely manner.The
    guidance given in ISO/IEC Guide 77-2:2008 contains technical recommendations intended
    to assist standardization committees and technical experts contributing their
    knowledge to the development of standard reference dictionaries compliant with
    the common ISO 13584/IEC 61360 dictionary model.It might also be useful for information
    experts responsible for the exchange of technical information between business
    partners or for the generation of applications of ISO 13584 and IEC 61360.ISO/IEC
    Guide 77-2:2008 is intended to support the achievement of industrial benefits
    of applications of the common ISO 13584/IEC 61360 dictionary model. The following
    are within the scope of ISO/IEC Guide 77-2:2008: general principles of product
    description and characterization; presentation of the concepts of product characterization
    classes, product properties, product ontology and reference dictionaries for products;
    universal identification of classes and properties; presentation of the modelling
    constructs that can be used for building reference dictionaries conforming to
    the common ISO 13584/IEC 61360 dictionary model; rules and principles for developing
    standard reference dictionaries; rules and principles for connecting standard
    reference dictionaries to avoid duplication and overlap; rules and principles
    for developing user-defined reference dictionaries and for connecting user-defined
    reference dictionaries to standard reference dictionaries; formats and mechanisms
    for exchanging reference dictionaries; mechanisms for connecting reference dictionaries
    to classification systems.The following are outside the scope of ISO/IEC Guide
    77-2:2008: an overview for ISO and IEC Technical Committees and industrial managers
    for the development of computer-processable product libraries, reference dictionaries
    and catalogues; case studies from experiences in the creation of reference dictionaries
    of product information in industrial practice; categorization of products for
    purposes other than product characterization.'
