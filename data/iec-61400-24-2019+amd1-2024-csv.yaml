  content: "IEC 61400-24:2019+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to lightning protection of wind
    turbine generators and wind power systems. Refer to guidelines for small wind
    turbines in annex. This document defines the lightning environment for wind turbines
    and risk assessment for wind turbines in that environment. It defines requirements
    for protection of blades, other structural components and electrical and control
    systems against both direct and indirect effects of lightning. Test methods to
    validate compliance are included. Guidance on the use of applicable lightning
    protection, industrial electrical and EMC standards including earthing is provided.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in
    2010. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) it is restructured with a main normative
