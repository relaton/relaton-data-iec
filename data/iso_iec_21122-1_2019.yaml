abstract:
- content: "This document defines a syntax (and an accompanying decompression process)
    that is capable to represent continuous-tone grey-scale, or continuous-tone colour
    digital images without visual loss at moderate compression rates. Typical compression
    rates are between 2:1 and 6:1 but can also be higher depending on the nature of
    the image. In particular, the syntax and the decoding process specified in this
    document allow lightweight encoder and decoder implementations that limit the
    end-to-end latency to a fraction of the frame size. However, the definition of
    transmission channel buffer models necessary to ensure such latency is beyond
    the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n- specifies a decoding
    process for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;<br />\r\n-
    specifies a codestream syntax containing information for interpreting the compressed
    image data;<br />\r\n- provides guidance on encoding processes for converting
    source image data to compressed image data."
