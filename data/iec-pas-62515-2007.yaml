  content: This PAS is intended to serve as a checklist and guideline for the evaluation
    of CAx-software for applications within the electromechanical field by users in
    industry. This PAS provides a set of data element types required in the context
    of electromechanical applications, especially in the context of electrical applications
    and their mechanical represen-tations in the real or virtual three-dimensional
    world.
