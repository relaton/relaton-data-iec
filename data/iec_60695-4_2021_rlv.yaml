    preparation of safety publications in accordance with the principles laid down
    in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. One of the responsibilities of a technical
    committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety publications in
    the preparation of its publications. The requirements, test methods or test conditions
    of this basic safety publication will not apply unless specifically referred to
    or included in the relevant publications. This fifth edition cancels and replaces
    the fourth edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The terms and definitions that are not specifically
    electrotechnical and that are either identical or equivalent to those in ISO 13943:2017

    electrotechnical and that are in ISO 13943:2017 have been included for the convenience
    of the user.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a basic safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51."
