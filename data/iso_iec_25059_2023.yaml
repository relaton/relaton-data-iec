abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 25059:2023 This document outlines a quality model for AI systems
    and is an application-specific extension to the standards on SQuaRE. The characteristics
    and sub-characteristics detailed in the model provide consistent terminology for
    specifying, measuring and evaluating AI system quality. The characteristics and
    sub-characteristics detailed in the model also provide a set of quality characteristics
    against which stated quality requirements can be compared for completeness.
