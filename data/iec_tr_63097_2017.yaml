abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 63097:2017(E) provides standards users with guidelines to select
    a most appropriate set of standards and specifications. These standards and specifications
    are either existing or planned, and are provided by IEC or other bodies also fulfilling
    use cases.<br />\r\nIt also aims at creating a common set of guiding principles
    that can be referenced by end-users and integrators who are responsible for the
    specification, design, and implementation of Smart Energy Systems.<br />\r\nAs
    a living document, this roadmap will be subject to future changes, modifications
    and additions, and will be incorporated into future editions.<br />\r\nAt the
    current stage, the focus remains the “Smart Grids”. This means that the full Smart
    Energy scope has not been addressed yet (i.e. the consideration necessary to include
    the interactions with other energies such as gas, and heat) and will be considered
    in a future edition of this document."
