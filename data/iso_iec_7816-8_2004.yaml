abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-8:2004 specifies interindustry commands for integrated
    circuit cards (either with contacts or without contacts) that may be used for
    cryptographic operations. These commands are complementary to and based on the
    commands listed in ISO/IEC 7816-4.</p><p>Annexes are provided that give examples
    of operations related to digital signatures, certificates and the import and export
    of asymmetric keys.</p><p>The choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanisms
    may affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of algorithms
    and protocols is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 7816-8.</p>"
