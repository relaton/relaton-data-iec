  content: "IEC 61340-4-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 61340-4-4:2018
    specifies requirements for flexible intermediate bulk containers (FIBC) between
    0,25 m3 and 3 m3 in volume, intended for use in hazardous explosive atmospheres.
    The explosive atmosphere can be created by the contents in the FIBC or can exist
    outside the FIBC. The requirements include:<br />\r\n– classification and labelling
    of FIBC;<br />\r\n– classification of inner liners;<br />\r\n– specification of
    test methods for each type of FIBC, inner liner, labels and document pockets;<br
    />\r\n– design and performance requirements for FIBC, inner liners, labels and
    document pockets;<br />\r\n– safe use of FIBC (including those with inner liners)
    within different zones defined for explosion endangered environments, described
    for areas where combustible dusts are, or can be, present (IEC 60079-10-2), and
    for explosive gas atmospheres (IEC 60079-10-1);<br />\r\n– procedures for type
    qualification and certification of FIBC, including the safe use of inner liners.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published in 2012,
    and Amendment 1:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) in light of experimental evidence, the maximum resistance
    to ground limit for Type C FIBC, and corresponding resistance limits for inner
    liners used in Type C FIBC has been increased from 10 M ohms to 100 M ohms;<br
    />\r\nb) the classification of Type L1 inner liners has been revised and extended
    to include Type L1C inner liners made from multi-layer materials with a conductive
    internal layer;<br />\r\nc) a labelling requirement to include a reference to
    IEC TS 60079-32-1 for guidance on earthing has been added.</p>"
