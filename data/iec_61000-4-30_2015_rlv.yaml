abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-4-30:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-30:2015 defines
    the methods for measurement and interpretation of results for power quality parameters
    in a.c. power supply systems with a declared fundamental frequency of 50 Hz or
    60 Hz. Measurement methods are described for each relevant parameter in terms
    that give reliable and repeatable results, regardless of the method's implementation.
    This standard addresses measurement methods for in-situ measurements. Measurement
    of parameters covered by this standard is limited to conducted phenomena in power
    systems. The power quality parameters considered in this standard are power frequency,
    magnitude of the supply voltage, flicker, supply voltage dips and swells, voltage
    interruptions, transient voltages, supply voltage unbalance, voltage harmonics
    and interharmonics, mains signalling on the supply voltage, rapid voltage changes,
    and current measurements. Emissions in the 2 kHz to 150 kHz range are considered
    in Annex C (informative), and over- and underdeviations are considered in Annex
    D (informative). Depending on the purpose of the measurement, all or a subset
    of the phenomena on this list may be measured. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2008. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the measurement method for current,
    previously informative, is now normative with some changes;<br />\r\n- the measurement
    method for RVC (rapid voltage change) has been added;<br />\r\n- the measurement
    method for conducted emissions in the 2 kHz to 150 kHz range has been added in
    informative Annex C;<br />\r\n- underdeviation and overdeviation parameters are
    moved to informative Annex D;<br />\r\n- Class A and Class S measurement methods
    are defined and clarified, while Class B is moved to informative Annex E and considered
    for future removal;<br />\r\n- measurement methods continue in this standard,
    but responsibility for influence quantities, performance, and test procedures
    are transferred to IEC 62586-2.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of December
    2016 have been included in this copy."
