- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 29197:2015 addresses<br />
    - fundamental requirements for planning and execution of environmental performance evaluations for biometric systems based on scenario and operational test methodologies,<br />
    - specifications to define, establish, and measure specific conditions to assess, including requirements for equipment,<br />
    - requirements for establishing a baseline performance in order to compare the influence of environmental parameters,<br />
    - a specification of the biometric evaluation including requirements for test population, test protocols, data to record, and test results, and<br />
    - procedures for carrying out the overall evaluation.<br />
    It does not<br />
    - determine which parameters should be analysed for a specific biometric modality (This is currently covered in ISO/IEC/TR 19795-3),<br />
    - specify requirements to perform a vulnerability analysis modifying environmental factors (This is covered by ISO/IEC 19792),<br />
    - classify biometric systems upon performance against different environmental conditions, or<br />
    - specify requirements for determining the functional effects of environmental conditions on hardware components (such as corrosion, electrical interference, breakage, etc.) of biometric systems.
