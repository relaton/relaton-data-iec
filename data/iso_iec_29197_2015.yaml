abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 29197:2015 addresses</p><p>?
    fundamental requirements for planning and execution of environmental performance
    evaluations for biometric systems based on scenario and operational test methodologies,</p><p>?
    specifications to define, establish, and measure specific conditions to assess,
    including requirements for equipment,</p><p>? requirements for establishing a
    baseline performance in order to compare the influence of environmental parameters,</p><p>?
    a specification of the biometric evaluation including requirements for test population,
    test protocols, data to record, and test results, and</p><p>? procedures for carrying
    out the overall evaluation.</p><p>It does not</p><p>? determine which parameters
    should be analysed for a specific biometric modality (This is currently covered
    in ISO/IEC/TR 19795‑3.),</p><p>? specify requirements to perform a vulnerability
    analysis modifying environmental factors (This is covered by ISO/IEC 19792.),</p><p>?
    classify biometric systems upon performance against different environmental conditions,
    or</p><p>? specify requirements for determining the functional effects of environmental
    conditions on hardware components (such as corrosion, electrical interference,
    breakage, etc.) of biometric systems.</p>
