  content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314, is intended
    for use in a high performance general purpose multistation network and is designed
    for efficient operation with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token
    Ring Architecture with optical fibre as the transmission medium. FDDI provides
    for hundreds of stations operating over an extent of tens of kilometres. The FDDI
    Physical Media Dependent (PMD) standard, ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314-3, specifies the lower
    sublayer of the Physical Layer for the FDDI, including the optical interface for
    multimode fibre FDDI stations. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314 is an abstract test
    suite (ATS) conformance test for FDDI PMD. ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314-3 specifies the optical
    interface of FDDI stations; it is not a protocol standard and this part of ISO&#x2F;IEC
    9314 requires the measurement of physical quantities such as optical power, wavelength
    and signal jitter. The intent of this part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314 is to specify
    the tests as broadly as possible to allow measurement by various detailed test
    implementations.
