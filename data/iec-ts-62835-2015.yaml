  content: IEC TS 62835:2015(E) contains accessibility recommendations to enable the
    use of toasters by older persons and persons with disabilities. It provides guidance
    to achieve more accessible toasters. This Technical Specification provides test
    methods and data that support accessible design. This Technical Specification
    gives guidance to apply ISO/TR 22411 and ISO/IEC Guide 71 to the design of toasters
    and to IEC 60442. It does not deal with safety issues nor cover toasters for professional
    use.
