abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-9-5:2024 provides support and strategies for institutions
    involved in rural electrification projects. It documents technical approaches
    for designing, building, testing, and maintaining off-grid renewable energy and
    hybrid systems with AC nominal voltage below 500 V, DC nominal voltage below 750
    V and nominal power below 100 kVA.<br />\r\nThe purpose of this document is to
    specify laboratory test methods for evaluating the quality assurance of stand-alone
    renewable energy products. This document is specifically related to renewable
    energy products that are packaged and made available to end-use consumers at the
    point of purchase as single, stand-alone products that do not require additional
    system components to function.<br />\r\nThis document establishes the framework
    for creating a product specification, the basis for evaluating quality for a particular
    context. Product specifications include minimum requirements for quality standards
    and warranty requirements.<br />\r\nThis document applies to stand-alone renewable
    energy products having the following characteristics: This document was written
    primarily for off-grid renewable energy products with batteries and PV modules
    with DC system voltages not exceeding 35 V and peak power ratings not exceeding
    350 W. This document includes provisions related to safety; however, it is not
    intended to be a comprehensive safety standard. In particular, this document is
    not intended to be used as an alternative to safety standards such as IEC 62368-1
    or IEC 60335 (all parts) for appliances such as radios and televisions that are
    included with stand-alone renewable energy products"
