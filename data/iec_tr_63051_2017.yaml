abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63051:2017(E) describes the main functional requirements for an
    HDLMath language and compares existing HDLMath languages from the viewpoint of
    designers. It is intended to accelerate the standardization of a mathematical
    algorithm design language and to help establish a new and good system modeling
    and verification environment.
