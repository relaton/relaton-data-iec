  content: "CISPR TR 18-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCISPR TR 18-1:2017
    which is a Technical Report, applies to radio noise from overhead power lines,
    associated equipment, and high-voltage equipment which may cause interference
    to radio reception. The scope of this document includes the causes, measurement
    and effects of radio interference, design aspects in relation to this interference,
    methods and examples for establishing limits and prediction of tolerable levels
    of interference from high voltage overhead power lines and associated equipment,
    to the reception of radio signals and services. The frequency range covered is
    0,15 MHz to 3 GHz. Radio frequency interference caused by the pantograph of overhead
    railway traction systems is not considered in this document. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- updated description of
    the RF characteristics of spark discharges which might contain spectral radio
    noise components up to the GHz frequency range;<br />\r\n- addition of state of
    the art in HVDC converter technology<br />\r\nKeywords: radio noise from overhead
    power lines and high-voltage equipment"
