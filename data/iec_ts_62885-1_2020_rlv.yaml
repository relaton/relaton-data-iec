- content: "IEC TS 62885-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 62885-1:2020
    specifies the physical characteristics of test equipment and material used in
    tests common to several products covered by the IEC 62885 series for surface cleaning
    appliances. In addition, it provides guidance regarding the evaluation of Wilton
    and other types of carpets to determine their acceptability for testing and pre-treatment
    of test dust. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical change with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Clauses 4 and 5 on test carpets have been combined into the
    new Clause 4;<br />\r\nb) a new Clause 5 has been added containing specifications
    and treatment of various kinds of test dust;<br />\r\nc) a level loop test carpet
    specification has been added."
