  content: "CISPR 16-2-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nCISPR 16-2-3:2016 specifies
    the methods of measurement of radiated disturbance phenomena in the frequency
    range of 9 kHz to 18 GHz. The aspects of measurement uncertainty are specified
    in CISPR 16-4-1 and CISPR 16-4-2. It has the status of a basic EMC publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 107, \"Electromagnetic compatibility - Guide to the
    drafting of electromagnetic compatibility publications\". This fourth edition
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2010, its Amendment
    1:2010 and its Amendment 2:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
