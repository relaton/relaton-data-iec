    <p>This document specifies the design and use of the RFID Emblem: an easily identified visual guide that indicates the presence of radio frequency identification (RFID). It does not address the location of the RFID Emblem on a label. Specific placement requirements are left to application standards developers.</p>
    <p>This document also specifies an RFID Index, which can be included in the RFID Emblem and which addresses the complication added by the wide range of RFID tags in existence (frequency, protocol and data structure). The RFID Index is a two-character code that provides specific information about tags and interrogators. Successful reading of RFID tags requires knowledge of the frequency, protocol and data structure information provided by the RFID Index.</p>
