abstract:
- content: "IEC 61557-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61557-1:2019
    specifies the general requirements applicable to measuring and monitoring equipment
    for testing the electrical safety in low-voltage distribution systems with nominal
    voltages up to 1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC. When measuring equipment or measuring
    installations involve measurement tasks of various measuring equipment covered
    by this series of standards, then the part of this series relevant to each of
    the measurement tasks is applicable. Other parts of IEC 61557 can specify additional
    requirements or deviations. This document does not cover functional safety or
    cybersecurity. IEC 61557-1:2019 cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This third edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) terms aligned with IEC 60050;<br />\r\nb) measurement of uncertainty
    revised according to the equations in 4.2 of ISO/IEC Guide 98-3:2008 (GUM);<br
    />\r\nc) updated references for safety and EMC requirements;<br />\r\nd) updated
    references for marking and operating instructions;<br />\r\ne) updated references
    for testing safety and EMC;<br />\r\nf) Annex A contains an explanation of GUM;<br
    />\r\ng) Annex B addresses environmental aspects."
