abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29167-16:2022 This document describes a crypto suite based on
    elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for the ISO/IEC 18000 series of standards protocol.
    In particular, this document specifies the use of elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman
    (ECDH) key agreement in a secure channel establishment and the use of elliptic
    curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA) in an authentication mechanism.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies a crypto suite for ECDSA-ECDH for air interface for RFID systems.
    The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.<br />\r\nThis
    document defines a mutual authentication method and methods of use for the cipher.
    A Tag and an Interrogator can support one, a subset, or all of the specified options,
    clearly stating what is supported. Key update is not supported in this document.<br
    />\r\nECDSA-ECDH cipher is a high-weight security protocol especially for active
    RFID system, aiming at meeting those scenarios with high level security requirement."
