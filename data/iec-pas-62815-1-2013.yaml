  content: IEC/PAS 62815-1:2013(E) specifies the safety requirements for tubular type
    cold cathode fluorescent lamps for backlight unit purposes (used for flat panel
    displays such as TVs and monitors etc.), hereafter called &quot;lamps&quot;. This
    PAS will be revised to include other types of lamp when a need for them is recognized.
    It also specifies the method a manufacturer should use to show compliance with
    the requirements of this PAS on the basis of whole production appraisal in association
    with test records on finished products.
