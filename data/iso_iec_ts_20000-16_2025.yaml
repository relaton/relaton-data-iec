abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides guidance for including sustainability
    within a service management system (SMS) based on the requirements defined in
    ISO/IEC 20000-1. It is aimed at:</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->organizations that are
    intending to implement the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000-1 and directly address
    sustainability;</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!--
    [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->organizations that intend to leverage their
    existing SMS to enable sustainability actions and sustainable delivery;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->consultants,
    trainers and other experts supporting organizations that utilize ISO/IEC 20000-1,
    so that they can be informed on how to include sustainability actions in an SMS.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">Sustainability in this context has three interdependent dimensions,
    which are environmental, social and economic. Annex A expands on the three dimensions
    with examples of each.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The guidance provided in this
    document aims to help organizations consider and address sustainability objectives
    as well as challenges related to their services. The complexity and detail surrounding
    the inclusion of sustainability within an SMS will vary and be dependent on the
    context of the organization, the scope of the SMS, compliance obligations and
    the nature of the services within the scope of the SMS.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document is intended to be used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 20000-1 to address
    sustainability objectives related to specific requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1.
    As such, it is anticipated that the user of this document is aware of the requirements
    in ISO/IEC 20000-1. The suggestions included across clauses in this document will
    be most effective when applied to an SMS which is implemented according to the
    corresponding clauses in ISO/IEC 20000-1. Application of this guidance to an SMS
    according to ISO/IEC 20000-1 is therefore recommended.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document supports and is an addition to the guidance already provided in ISO/IEC
    20000-2, ISO/IEC 20000-3, ISO/IEC TS 20000-5 and other parts of the ISO/IEC 20000
    series.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Organizations can use the guidance in this document
    to also address the new requirements identified in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018/Amd 1:2024
    and ISO’s objectives to address climate change.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The
    recommendations in this document for improving sustainability within an SMS are
    not exclusive and can be implemented along with other sustainability initiatives.</p>'
