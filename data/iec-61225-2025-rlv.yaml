  content: "IEC 61225:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61225:2025
    specifies the performance and the functional characteristics of the low voltage
    static uninterruptible power supply (SUPS) systems in a nuclear power plant (NPP)
    and, when applicable, in nuclear facilities in general. An uninterruptible power
    supply (UPS) is an electrical equipment which draws electrical energy from a source,
    stores it, and maintains the supply in a specified form by means inside the equipment
    to output terminals. A SUPS has no rotating parts to perform its functions. The
    specific design requirements for the components of the power supply system are
    covered by IEC standards and other standards listed in the normative references.
    Otherwise, specific component-level design requirements are outside the scope
    of this document."
