abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63424-1:2024 describes the methods for validating dynamic power
    control and (dynamic) exposure time-averaging (DPC-ETA) algorithms used in RF
    modem chipsets of wireless devices. The DPC-ETA implementations are exposure-based,
    where SAR is time-averaged according to power recorded by the RF modem. Time-averaging
    windows up to six minutes consistent with applicable SAR limits and regulatory
    policies are considered for frequencies up to 6 GHz. The DPC-ETA power control
    parameters are established based on SAR compliance results with all relevant design
    and operating tolerances taken into consideration. The device output power is
    controlled by DPC-ETA to maintain SAR compliance in real-time. While SAR compliance
    is evaluated independently by applying IEC/IEEE 62209-1528:2020 [1], this document
    contains information for algorithm validation.<br />\r\nQuasi-static and dynamic
    power control test sequences are described in this document for algorithm validation.
    The test sequences are sent from a radio communication tester (RCT) and DPC-ETA
    responses are measured with conducted and radiated power measurement methods to
    confirm algorithm functionality. Test sequences for wireless configurations that
    need validation, including wireless mode transitions, call drop, handover, discontinuous
    transmission, and simultaneous transmission are described. Considerations for
    measurement automation to acquire time-aligned results for correlation with power
    changes in the test sequences are provided. DPC-ETA algorithms are validated by
    correlating the normalized power measurement results with the expected behaviours
    of an implementation for the applied test sequences. The procedures in this document
    also support algorithm validation of modular transmitters using an appropriate
    test platform. Guidance for using SAR methods in place of radiated power measurements
    and capacitive proximity sensor triggering with time-averaged detection are also
    included.<br />\r\nNOTE 1窶ア separate document will be considered to validate DPC-ETA
    implementations above 6 GHz, according to near-field millimetre-wave band power
    density exposure requirements. Substantially shorter time-averaging window durations,
    on the order of a few seconds, can be required to satisfy some national regulatory
    requirements.<br />\r\nNOTE 2窶サhe scope of this document is limited to cellular
    network technologies that have RF modem transmission power dictated by a base
    station and therefore can be tested using RCT test sequences. Cellular network
    technologies (also referred to as wireless wide area networks (WWAN)) include
    Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM), Universal Mobile Telecommunication
    System (UMTS), Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G New Radio (NR), including other
    related 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G specifications, respectively. A separate document will
    be considered for validating DPC-ETA implementations for wireless local area network
    (WLAN) technologies, such as those based on the IEEE 802.11 standards series.
    With WLAN technologies, the transmit power is dictated independently by the RF
    modem and can be specific to each power control implementation, requiring different
    testing approaches.<br />\r\nNOTE 3窶サhe procedures in this document can also be
    considered for 3GPP [2] 5G NR FR1 bands above 6 GHz.<br />\r\nNOTE 4窶サhis document
    does not address algorithm validation for simultaneous transmission configurations
    involving transmitters that are not controlled by DPC-ETA operations in the RF
    modem. These are evaluated according to regulatory requirements."
