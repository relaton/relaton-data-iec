    to IEC 61558-1:2017.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-12:2024 deals with the safety
    of constant voltage transformers for general applications and power supply units
    for constant voltage for general applications. Constant voltage transformers incorporating
    electronic circuits are also covered by this document.<br />\r\nThis third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) adjustment
    of structure and references in accordance with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\nb) description
    of constructions moved to IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\nc) new symbol for power supply
    unit with linearly regulated output voltage.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group
    safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
