    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document provides requirements and recommendations for developing education and training systems using virtual, augmented and mixed reality (VR/AR/MR) technology. It specifies how to organize the information and data necessary for the development of VR/AR/MR integrated systems for education and training. It includes procedures for the development of VR/AR/MR integrated systems.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document includes several topics for consideration when developing VR/AR/MR based education and training systems, as follows. First, it defines concepts of VR/AR/MR based education and training. Second, it defines an information modelling architecture for the systems. Third, standards based functional components for the systems are specified. Fourth, framework components for implementing the systems are specified. And, finally, use cases for the systems based on the information modelling architecture are included.</span></p>
