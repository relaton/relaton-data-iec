  content: "IEC 62341-6-1:2022 specifies the standard measuring conditions and measuring
    methods for determining the optical and electro-optical parameters of organic
    light emitting diode (OLED) display modules, and where specified, OLED display
    panels. These methods are limited to flat displays measured in a dark room. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- measuring methods for power consumption of displays
    that have an embedded video connection terminal are added;<br />\r\n- the contents
    description including video signal for power consumption is modified."
