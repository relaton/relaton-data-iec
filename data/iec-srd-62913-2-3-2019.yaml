  content: "IEC SRD 62913-2-3:2019(E) initiates and illustrates the IEC’s systems
    approach based on Use Cases and involving the identification of generic smart
    grid requirements for further standardization work for resources connected to
    the electric power systems – i.e. distributed energy resources, smart home/commercial/industrial/DR-customer
    energy management, energy storage, and bulk generation domains – based on the
    methods and tools developed in IEC SRD 62913-1.<br />\r\nThis document captures
    possible \"common and repeated usage\" of a smart grid system, under the format
    of \"Uses Cases\" with a view to feeding further standardization activities. Use
    Cases can be described in different ways and can represent competing alternatives.
    From there, this document derives the common requirements to be considered by
    these further standardization activities in term of interfaces between actors
    interacting with the given system.<br />\r\nTo this end, Use Case implementations
    are given for information purposes only. The interface requirements to be considered
    for later standardization activities are summarized (typically information pieces,
    communication services and specific non-functional requirements: performance level,
    security specification, etc.).<br />\r\nThis analysis is based on the business
    input from domain experts as well as existing material on grid management in a
    smart grid environment when relevant. Table 1 highlights the domains and business
    Use Cases described in this document.<br />\r\nElectric vehicles are on one hand
    considered as a DER and normally should fit in IEC SRD 62913-2-3; but on the other
    hand, and for historical reasons, they are separated into two documents and covered
    in the IEC SRD 62913-2-4 electric transportation domain."
