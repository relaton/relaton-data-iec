abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62736:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 62736:2023
    specifies requirements and methods for periodic testing of the quality of diagnostic
    medical ultrasound systems using reflection-mode (pulse-echo) imaging. Image measurement
    and interpretation workstations are included. This document includes minimum sets
    of such tests intended for frequent users of medical ultrasound systems, for quality
    assurance professionals in their organizations, or those hired from other quality-control
    and/or service-provider organizations. The procedures are for a wide range of
    more common diagnostic ultrasound systems, currently operating from 1 MHz to 40
    MHz, although available phantoms meet the specifications only from 1 MHz to 23
    MHz.<br />\r\nThe tests are defined in three levels, with the simplest and most
    cost-effective performed most frequently:<br />\r\n- Level 1 comprises five quick
    tests/observations to be performed daily to monthly by those normally operating
    the systems.<br />\r\n- Level 2 includes one necessary test for all systems in
    addition to those of Level 1, two Level 1 tests performed more rigorously, two
    tests that are for special situations or equipment, and one that is just optional,
    included because it is highly developed. Level 2 tests are performed annually
    by those with meaningful quality assurance training.<br />\r\n- Level 3 extends
    the two special situations tests to all systems, adds one optional test and includes
    a periodic review of the QA programme.<br />\r\nFrequent distance-measurement
    accuracy tests are recommended in this document only for certain classes of position
    encoding that are not now known to be highly stable and without bias. QA in all
    dimensions is recommended in this document as the first test for such systems.<br
    />\r\nThe test methodology is applicable for transducers operating in the 1 MHz
    to 23 MHz frequency range. The types of transducers used with these scanners include<br
    />\r\na) electronic phased arrays,<br />\r\nb) linear arrays,<br />\r\nc) convex
    arrays,<br />\r\nd) mechanical transducers,<br />\r\ne) two-dimensional arrays
    operated in a 2D imaging mode,<br />\r\nf) transducers operating in 3D imaging
    mode for a limited number of sets of reconstructed 2D images, and<br />\r\ng)
    three-dimensional scanning transducers based on a combination of the above types.<br
    />\r\nAll tests on scanners considered here evaluate basic pulse-echo techniques
    and might detect most failures in other modes. Dedicated Doppler systems, or other
    systems for detection of blood motion, are excluded from this scope as specialized
    equipment is required to test them. Such test equipment can be specific to the
    intended application of the Doppler system. This document includes definition
    of terms and specifies methods for measuring the maximum relative depth of penetration
    of real-time ultrasound B MODE scanners, though this penetration measure is listed
    as less frequently applied.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62736:2023 cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) expansion of the applicable types of transducers
    and the frequency range of application;<br />\r\nb) extension of test protocols
    and image assessments, including for very-low-echo spheres;<br />\r\nc) revision
    of phantom designs and their acoustic properties, consistent with the second edition
    of IEC TS 62791;<br />\r\nd) inclusion of luminance tests for system-image display
    consistency at scanner and remote monitors;<br />\r\ne) addition of special considerations
    for 3D-imaging transducers (Annex D) and workbook examples (Annex E)."
