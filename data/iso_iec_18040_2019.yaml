abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document defines a reference
    model and base components for representing and controlling a single LAE or multiple
    LAEs in an MAR scene. It defines concepts, a reference model, system framework,
    functions and how to integrate a 2D/3D virtual world and LAEs, and their interfaces,
    in order to provide MAR applications with interfaces of LAEs. It also defines
    an exchange format necessary for transferring and storing LAE-related data between
    LAE-based MAR applications.</p><p>This document specifies the following functionalities:</p><p>a)
    definitions for an LAE in MAR;</p><p>b) representation of an LAE;</p><p>c) representation
    of properties of an LAE;</p><p>d) sensing of an LAE in a physical world;</p><p>e)
    integration of an LAE into a 2D/3D virtual scene;</p><p>f) interaction between
    an LAE and objects in a 2D/3D virtual scene;</p><p>g) transmission of information
    related to an LAE in an MAR scene.</p><p>This document defines a reference model
    for LAE representation-based MAR applications to represent and to exchange data
    related to LAEs in a 2D/3D virtual scene in an MAR scene. It does not define specific
    physical interfaces necessary for manipulating LAEs, that is, it does not define
    how specific applications need to implement a specific LAE in an MAR scene, but
    rather defines common functional interfaces for representing LAEs that can be
    used interchangeably between MAR applications.</p>
