abstract:
- content: "This document defines a reference model and base components for representing
    and controlling a single LAE or multiple LAEs in an MAR scene. It defines concepts,
    a reference model, system framework, functions and how to integrate a 2D/3D virtual
    world and LAEs, and their interfaces, in order to provide MAR applications with
    interfaces of LAEs. It also defines an exchange format necessary for transferring
    and storing LAE-related data between LAE-based MAR applications.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies the following functionalities:<br />\r\na) definitions for
    an LAE in MAR;<br />\r\nb) representation of an LAE;<br />\r\nc) representation
    of properties of an LAE;<br />\r\nd) sensing of an LAE in a physical world;<br
    />\r\ne) integration of an LAE into a 2D/3D virtual scene;<br />\r\nf) interaction
    between an LAE and objects in a 2D/3D virtual scene;<br />\r\ng) transmission
    of information related to an LAE in an MAR scene.<br />\r\nThis document defines
    a reference model for LAE representation-based MAR applications to represent and
    to exchange data related to LAEs in a 2D/3D virtual scene in an MAR scene. It
    does not define specific physical interfaces necessary for manipulating LAEs,
    that is, it does not define how specific applications need to implement a specific
    LAE in an MAR scene, but rather defines common functional interfaces for representing
    LAEs that can be used interchangeably between MAR applications."
