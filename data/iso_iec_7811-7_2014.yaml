abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7811-7:2014 is one of a series of International Standards describing
    the characteristics for identification cards as defined in the definitions clause
    and the use of such cards for international interchange.</p><p>It specifies requirements
    for a high coercivity magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on an
    identification card and encoding technique. It takes into consideration both human
    and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.</p><p>Coercivity influences
    many of the quantities specified in ISO/IEC 7811-7:2014 but is not itself specified.
    The main characteristic of the high coercivity magnetic stripe is its improved
    resistance to erasure. This is achieved with minimal probability of damage to
    other magnetic stripes by contact while retaining read compatibility with magnetic
    stripes as defined in ISO/IEC 7811‑2.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7811-7:2014 provides for a
    card capacity of approximately 10 times that of a card conforming to ISO/IEC 7811‑6.
    The number of tracks has been increased to six, each track being approximately
    half the width of tracks conforming to ISO/IEC 7811‑6, located so that readers
    designed to read these high density tracks will also be able to read cards conforming
    to ISO/IEC 7811‑2 and ISO/IEC 7811‑6. Data is encoded in 8 bit bytes using the
    MFM encoding technique. Data framing is used to limit error propagation and error
    correction techniques further improve reliability of reading.</p><p>It is the
    purpose of this series of International Standards to provide criteria to which
    cards shall perform. No consideration is given within these International Standards
    to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the card prior to test. Failure to
    conform to specified criteria should be negotiated between the involved parties.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    10373‑2 specifies the test procedures used to check cards against the parameters
    specified in ISO/IEC 7811-7:2014.</p>"
