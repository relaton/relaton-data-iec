  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-22:2024, which is a Technical Report, aims to provide
    analysis, principles, use cases and guidance on how to use GOOSE/SV static-routing
    or auto-routing based on System Configuration Description (SCD) file to automated
    manage the substation network while without changing the requirements of IEDs.
    Furthermore, this document also intends to give novel practices on network and
    GOOSE/SV path condition monitoring which support visualization and supervision
    from higher level application side.<br />\r\nUsing the concepts developed in the
    IETF's Transparent Interconnection of Lots of Links (TRILL) using IS-IS protocol
    that is defined in RFC 6326 and ISO/IEC 10589 standards, this document defines
    network and system management data object models that are specific to power system
    operations. These data objects will be used to monitor the health of networks
    and systems, to detect abnormal behaviours of IEDs which contradict SCD file,
    such as unexpected IEDs or unexpected GOOSE/SV flows, and to support the management
    of the performance and reliability of the information infrastructure"
