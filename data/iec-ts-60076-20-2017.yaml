  content: "IEC TS 60076-20:2017(E) is applicable to transformers in the scope of
    IEC 60076-1. It proposes two methods of defining an energy efficiency index and
    introduces three methods of evaluating the energy performance of a transformer.
    The appropriate method is chosen by agreement between purchasers and manufacturers
    or according to local regulations.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of
    January 2018 have been included in this copy."
