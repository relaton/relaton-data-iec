  content: "IEC 60794-3-70:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-3-70:2021
    covers outdoor optical fibre cables intended for rugged terrestrial rapid/multiple
    deployment. These cables, with enhanced mechanical, environmental and ingress
    performance can be used wherever a rapid or multiple deployment is relevant (e.g.
    mobile broadcast units, emergency rescue services, tactical ground-forces, outdoor
    motion-robotics, mining machinery, temporary repair cables for damaged links,
    etc.). This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2016. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- incorporation of the new classification system for optical fibre categories,
    sub-categories in IEC 60793-2-10;<br />\r\n- incorporation of the new classification
    system for optical fibre categories, sub-categories and models in IEC 60793-2-50;<br
    />\r\n- updating of cabled fibre performance categories in alignment with ISO/IEC
    11801-1;<br />\r\n- updating of bibliographical references."
