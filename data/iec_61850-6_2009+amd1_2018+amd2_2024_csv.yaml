abstract:
- content: "IEC 61850-6:2009+AMD1:2018+AMD2:2024 CSV specifies a file format for describing
    communication-related IED (Intelligent Electronic Device) configurations and IED
    parameters, communication system configurations, switch yard (function) structures,
    and the relations between them. The main purpose of this format is to exchange
    IED capability descriptions, and SA system descriptions between IED engineering
    tools and the system engineering tool(s) of different manufacturers in a compatible
    way. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br
    />\r\n- functional extensions added based on changes in other Parts of IEC 61850,
    especially in IEC 61850-7-2 and IEC 61850-7-3;<br />\r\n- functional extensions
    concerning the engineering process, especially for configuration data exchange
    between system configuration tools, added;<br />\r\n- clarifications and corrections.<br
    />\r\nThis publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid."
