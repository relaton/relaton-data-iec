  content: "IEC 60335-2-124:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 60335-2-124:2024 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-124:2024 deals with the
    safety of dry ice blasting machines intended for commercial indoor or outdoor
    use for the hand-guided cleaning, decoating and stripping of surfaces. The blasting
    machines are either equipped with containers for storage of dry ice or produce
    dry ice internally. These machines are not equipped with a traction drive.<br
    />\r\nThe following power systems are covered:<br />\r\n- mains powered motors
    up to a rated voltage of 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other
    appliances,<br />\r\n- battery-operated machines.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- dry ice blasting machines with integrated generation of
    compressed air;<br />\r\n- dry ice blasting machines using other transport gases
    besides compressed air or nitrogen;<br />\r\n- dry ice blasting machines with
    nozzles being controlled by robotic arms;<br />\r\n- spray extraction machines
    for commercial use (IEC 60335-2-68);<br />\r\n- high pressure cleaners (IEC 60335-2-79);<br
    />\r\n- sand blasting equipment (abrasive blasting);<br />\r\n- hand-held and
    transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745 series, IEC 61029 series,
    IEC 62841 series);<br />\r\n- machines designed for use in corrosive or explosive
    environments (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- machines designed for use in vehicles
    in non-ventilated environment;<br />\r\n- machines designed for use on board of
    ships or aircraft."
