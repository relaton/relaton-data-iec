    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-1:2011 specifies the physical characteristics of integrated circuit cards with contacts. It applies to identification cards of the ID-1 card type, which can include embossing and/or a magnetic stripe and/or tactile identifier mark as specified in ISO/IEC 7811. Test methods are specified in ISO/IEC 10373-1.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-1:2011 applies to cards which have a physical interface with electrical contacts. It does not, however, define the nature, number and position of the integrated circuits in the cards.</p>
