  content: "IEC 61084-1:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies requirements and tests for cable
    trunking systems (CTS) and cable ducting systems (CDS) intended for the accommodation,
    and where necessary for the electrically protective separation, of insulated conductors,
    cables and possibly other electrical equipment in electrical and/or communication
    systems installations. The maximum voltage of these installations is 1 000 V AC
    and 1 500 V DC.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to conduit systems, cable
    tray systems, cable ladder systems, power track systems or equipment covered by
    other standards.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 1991 and Amendment 1:1993. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- classification;<br />\r\n- construction;<br
    />\r\n- mechanical and electrical properties.<br />\r\nThis part of the IEC 61084
    series is not intended to be used by itself."
