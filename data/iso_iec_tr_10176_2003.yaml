abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 10176:2003 provides guidelines for the preparation of Programming Language
    Standards.<br />\r\nStandards for programming languages are developed by many
    committees from many countries, with many different editors supporting the effort.
    ISO thus considered it necessary to develop guidelines so that these standards
    cover at least the following subjects:<br />\r\nConsistent terminology<br />\r\nConsistent
    structure<br />\r\nSyntax and semantics<br />\r\nError and exception handling<br
    />\r\nProvisions of options<br />\r\nPresentation of source programs<br />\r\nProcessor
    dependences<br />\r\nBinding strategies to functional standards<br />\r\nConformance
    definition<br />\r\nInternationalization and support of multiple languages<br
    />\r\nCultural convention related functionality<br />\r\nUse of expanded character
    repertoire for identifiers<br />\r\nUser documentation<br />\r\nThe constant additions
    to ISO/IEC 10646, the Universal character set, necessitate timely updates of ISO/IEC
    TR 10176 to allow the use of local scripts and characters in programming languages.
    Annex A of ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 provides such an expanded collection of characters,
    recommended for use in programming languages."
