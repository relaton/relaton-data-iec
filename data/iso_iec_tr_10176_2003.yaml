abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003(E) provides guidelines for the preparation of
    Programming Language Standards.</p><p>Standards for programming languages are
    developed by many committees from many countries, with many different editors
    supporting the effort. ISO thus considered it necessary to develop guidelines
    so that these standards cover at least the following subjects:</p><p>Consistent
    terminology</p><p>Consistent structure</p><p>Syntax and semantics</p><p>Error
    and exception handling</p><p>Provisions of options</p><p>Presentation of source
    programs</p><p>Processor dependences</p><p>Binding strategies to functional standards</p><p>Conformance
    definition</p><p>Internationalization and support of multiple languages</p><p>Cultural
    convention related functionality</p><p>Use of expanded character repertoire for
    identifiers</p><p>User documentation</p><p>The constant additions to ISO/IEC 10646,
    the Universal character set, necessitate timely updates of ISO/IEC TR 10176 to
    allow the use of local scripts and characters in programming languages. Annex
    A of ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 provides such an expanded collection of characters,
    recommended for use in programming languages.</p>"
