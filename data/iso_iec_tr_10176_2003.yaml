abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003(E) provides guidelines for the preparation of Programming
    Language Standards.   Standards for programming languages are developed by many
    committees from many countries, with many different editors supporting the effort.
    ISO thus considered it necessary to develop guidelines so that these standards
    cover at least the following subjects:   Consistent terminology   Consistent structure   Syntax
    and semantics   Error and exception handling   Provisions of options   Presentation
    of source programs   Processor dependences   Binding strategies to functional
    standards   Conformance definition   Internationalization and support of multiple
    languages   Cultural convention related functionality   Use of expanded character
    repertoire for identifiers   User documentation   The constant additions to ISO/IEC
    10646, the Universal character set, necessitate timely updates of ISO/IEC TR 10176
    to allow the use of local scripts and characters in programming languages. Annex
    A of ISO/IEC TR 10176:2003 provides such an expanded collection of characters,
    recommended for use in programming languages.'
