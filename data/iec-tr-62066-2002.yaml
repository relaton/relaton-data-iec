  content: Presents a general overview on the different kinds of surge overvoltages
    that can occur on low-voltage installations. Typical surge magnitude and duration
    as well as frequency of occurrence are described. Information on overvoltages
    resulting from interactions between power system and communications system is
    also provided. Additionally, general guidelines are given concerning surge protection
    means and systems on the basis of availability and risk considerations, including
    interactions and the need for coordination and consideration of temporary overvoltages
    in the selection of surge-protective devices.
