  content: 'IEC/IEEE 62271-37-082:2012(E) provides methods for the measurement of
    sound pressure level produced by outdoor alternating current circuit-breakers
    in a free-field environment. These methods may also be used indoors or in restricted
    field, provided that precautions are observed in the measurement and interpretation
    of the results. This standard has been prepared by subcommittee 17A: High-voltage
    switchgear and controlgear, of IEC technical committee 17: Switchgear and controlgear,
    in cooperation with the Switchgear Committee of the IEEE Power & Energy Society,
    under the IEC/IEEE Dual Logo Agreement between IEC and IEEE. The contents of the
    corrigendum of January 2014 have been included in this copy.'
