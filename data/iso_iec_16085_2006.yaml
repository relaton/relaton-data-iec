abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 16085:2006 defines a process for the management of risk in
    the life cycle. It can be added to the existing set of system and software life
    cycle processes defined by ISO/IEC 15288 and ISO/IEC 12207, or it can be used
    independently.</p><p>ISO/IEC 16085:2006 can be applied equally to systems and
    software.</p><p>Risk management is a key discipline for making effective decisions
    and communicating the results within organizations. The purpose of risk management
    is to identify potential managerial and technical problems before they occur so
    that actions can be taken that reduce or eliminate the probability and/or impact
    of these problems should they occur. It is a critical tool for continuously determining
    the feasibility of project plans, for improving the search for and identification
    of potential problems that can affect life cycle activities and the quality and
    performance of products, and for improving the active management of projects.</p>"
