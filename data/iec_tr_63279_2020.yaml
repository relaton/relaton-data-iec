abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63279:2020 reviews research into sequential and combined accelerated
    stress tests that have been devised to determine the potential for degradation
    modes in PV modules that occur in the field that single-factor and steady-state
    tests do not show. This document is intended to provide data and theory-based
    motivation and help visualize the next steps for improved accelerated stress tests
    that will derisk PV module materials and designs. Any incremental savings as a
    result of increased reliability and reduced risk translates into lower levelized
    cost of electricity for PV. Lower costs will result in faster adoption of PV and
    the associated benefits of renewable energy.
