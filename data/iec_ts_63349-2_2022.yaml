abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63349-2:2022 defines operation modes of photovoltaic direct-driven
    appliance (PVDDA) controllers and describes one example of a graphic display.
    The graphic display is an interface to PVDDA users, which uses easily understood
    graphics to show a real-time operation mode, such as what equipment is installed,
    controlled and monitored in the system, which equipment is generating power and
    how much it generates, and which equipment is consuming power and how much it
    consumes. This helps with user’s interest, knowledge, planning on renewable energy
    usage.
