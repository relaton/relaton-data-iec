    ISO/IEC 29167-10:2015 defines the crypto suite for AES 128 for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices that might be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and application standards.

    This part of ISO/IEC 29167 specifies a crypto suite for AES 128 for air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.

    This part of ISO/IEC 29167 defines various authentication methods and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag and an Interrogator can support one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported.
