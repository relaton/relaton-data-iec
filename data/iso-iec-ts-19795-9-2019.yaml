    <p>This document provides guidance for performance testing of biometrics when this technology is used on mobile devices with local biometric authentication to improve authentication assurance.</p>
    <p>This document aims to:</p>
    <p>—     Provide guidance for affordable and cost-efficient testing and reporting methods for performance assessment at a full system level of biometric systems embedded in mobile devices with offline evaluation of false accept rate (FAR) claims.</p>
    <p>—     Define modality-specific considerations of these methods.</p>
    <p>This document is applicable to:</p>
    <p>—     verification use cases related to secure transactions.</p>
    <p>This document is not applicable to:</p>
    <p>—     privacy aspects;</p>
    <p>—     secure authentication from mobile device to server;</p>
    <p>—     testing and reporting for presentation attack detection (PAD) mechanisms in mobile devices;</p>
    <p>—     performance testing of biometric sub-systems such as acquisition sub-system or comparison sub-system;</p>
    <p>—     continuous authentication.</p>
