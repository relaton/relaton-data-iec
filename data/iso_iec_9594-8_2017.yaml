abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594-8:2017 addresses some of the security requirements in
    the areas of authentication and other security services through the provision
    of a set of frameworks upon which full services can be based. Specifically, this
    Recommendation | International Standard defines frameworks for:</p><p>- public-key
    certificates; and</p><p>- attribute certificates.</p><p>The public-key certificate
    framework defined in this Recommendation | International Standard specifies the
    information objects and data types for a public-key infrastructure (PKI), including
    public-key certificates, certificate revocation lists (CRLs), trust broker and
    authorization and validation lists (AVLs). The attribute certificate framework
    specifies the information objects and data types for a privilege management infrastructure
    (PMI), including attribute certificates, and attribute certificate revocation
    lists (ACRLs). This Recommendation | International Standard also provides the
    framework for issuing, managing, using and revoking certificates. An extensibility
    mechanism is included in the defined formats for both certificate types and for
    all revocation list schemes. This Recommendation | International Standard also
    includes a set of extensions, which is expected to be generally useful across
    a number of applications of PKI and PMI. The schema components (including object
    classes, attribute types and matching rules) for storing PKI and PMI information
    in a directory, are included in this Recommendation | International Standard.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    9594-8:2017 specifies the framework for strong authentication, involving credentials
    formed using cryptographic techniques. It is not intended to establish this as
    a general framework for authentication, but it can be of general use for applications
    which consider these techniques adequate.</p><p>Authentication (and other security
    services) can only be provided within the context of a defined security policy.
    It is a matter for users of an application to define their own security policy.</p>"
