abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61158 is one of a series produced to facilitate the interconnection
    of automation system components. It is related to other standards in the set as
    defined by the three-layer Fieldbus Reference Model, which is based in part on
    the Basic Reference Model for Open Systems Interconnection. Both Reference Models
    subdivide the area of standardisation for interconnection into a series of layers
    of specification, each of manageable size. This standard describes the Fieldbus
    Application Layer (FAL) protocol that defines the information interchange and
    the interactions between Application Entity invocations (AE-Is) to support the
    Application Services. The Application Protocol provides the Application Service
    by making use of the services available from the Data Link Layer or other immediately
    lower layer. The contents of the corrigendum of July 2004 have been included in
    this copy.
