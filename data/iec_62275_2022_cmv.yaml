abstract:
- content: "IEC 62275:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62275:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 62275:2018
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 23A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62275:2022 specifies requirements for metallic, non-metallic and
    composite cable ties and their associated fixing devices as a means used for managing
    or securing the wiring systems in electrical installations. Cable ties and associated
    fixing devices can also be suitable for other applications, such as support of
    wiring systems, and where so used, additional requirements can apply. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2018. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- scope clarification,<br
    />\r\n- new definitions,<br />\r\n- deletion of the exception for the stabilization
    of the moisture content,<br />\r\n- possibility to carry out tensile strength
    tests with dead weights,<br />\r\n- differentiation of rubber and acrylic adhesive
    fixings,<br />\r\n- clarification for mechanical testing of integral devices,<br
    />\r\n- clarifications on Table 6,<br />\r\n- clarifications in 9.1,<br />\r\n-
    the minimum installation temperature test for cable ties is carried out only when
    the declared minimum temperature is lower than 0 Â°C,<br />\r\n- a requirement
    that metallic cable ties be classified according to 6.2.3,<br />\r\n- definition
    of colours to be tested for contribution to fire,<br />\r\n- addition of a \"some
    countries\" note in Clause 10,<br />\r\n- clarification of the mounting of fixing
    devices in the resistance to ultraviolet light test,<br />\r\n- clarification
    on the testing of integral devices in the resistance to ultraviolet light test."
