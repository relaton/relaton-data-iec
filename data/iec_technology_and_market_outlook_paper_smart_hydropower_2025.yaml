abstract:
- content: "Establishing a zero-carbon power system is essential for achieving carbon
    neutrality. Transitioning to a clean energy world with different renewable energies
    is complicated, however.<br /><br />\r\nFor one, we must ensure a safe and steady
    power supply. At the same time, the rising proportion of new energy types needs
    to be acknowledged while keeping a reasonable cost for the entire power system.<br
    /><br />\r\nThe new IEC technology and market outlook paper (TMOP) recognizes
    hydropower as a technically mature, widely applied, economical and flexibly regulated
    power source to support a zero-carbon power system. It outlines and analyzes the
    main driving forces for hydropowerâ€™s development, current status of global development
    and also provides an overview of the key technologies and technical challenges.<br
    /><br />\r\nThe paper notes that smart hydropower is expanding the functions of
    traditional hydropower, carrying forward its advantages and overcoming its shortcomings.
    A smarter system will provide more efficient and economical energy solutions for
    countries, which also align with sustainable development goals.<br /><br />\r\nFinally,
    the paper highlights the important role standards can play in promoting the development
    of hydropower, including smarter technologies. It shows potential use-cases and
    identifies where standardization is most needed, and urges standardization bodies
    to address needs for smart hydropower and related technologies to help stay sufficiently
    on track for net-zero goals.<br /><br />\r\nThis TMOP has been prepared by a project
    team from a variety of organizations, including representatives from power suppliers,
    universities, research institutes and industry associations, working under the
    IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB).<br /><br />\r\nThis TMOP is available for free
    download."
