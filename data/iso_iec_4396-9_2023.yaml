abstract:
- content: "This document provides the Error and Flow Control Protocol (EFCP) specification.
    EFCP provides an inter-process communication (IPC) service to an application process,
    which can be a (N+1)-IPC process (IPCP), with the requested Quality of Service
    (QoS). One or more service data units (SDUs) are passed on the (N)-port-id to
    the (N)-DIF (distributed IPC facility) to be sent to the destination application
    process. Protocol data units (PDUs) transferred by the (N)-DIF are delivered to
    the (N)-port-id for the using Application Process. This document describes the
    placement of EFCP within RINA, the components EFCP consists of, and the mechanisms
    and policies that are involved in EFCPâ€™s work, and the timers and control mechanisms
    required to manage the connection.<br />\r\nEFCP comprises two logical components,
    the data transfer procedures (DTP), providing tightly bound mechanisms and the
    data transfer control procedures (DTCP), which provides loosely bound mechanisms.<br
    />\r\nThis document provides:<br />\r\n- the service definition;<br />\r\n- an
    overview of EFCP;<br />\r\n- a description of the placement of EFCP within recursive
    internetwork architecture (RINA);<br />\r\n- the common elements of data transfer
    protocol (DTP) and data transfer control protocol (DTCP);<br />\r\n- DTP structure
    and functions;<br />\r\n- DTCP structure and functions;<br />\r\n- an informative
    list of all policies in EFCP."
