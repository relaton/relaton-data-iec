  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-5:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristics\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">contact
    resistance, and</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">sheet resistance</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nfor
    graphene-based materials and other two-dimensional materials by a\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">transmission line measurement.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe
    method uses test structures applied to the 2D material by photolithographic methods
    consisting of several metal electrodes with increasing spacing between the electrodes.
    By a measurement of the voltage drop between different pairs of electrodes, sheet
    resistance and contact resistance can be calculated.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">The
    method can be applied to any other two-dimensional materials which are subject
    to electrical metal contact on top of the materials.</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">The
    method provides accurate and reproducible results, if the electrical contact formed
    between the two-dimensional material and the metal electrodes provides ohmic contact
    property.</li>\r\n</ul>"
