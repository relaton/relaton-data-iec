abstract:
- content: "<p>This document describes the model of database language SQL as defined
    in ISO/IEC 9075-1, ISO/IEC 9075-2, and ISO/IEC 9075-11. The meanings of and the
    relationships between various concepts of that model are described in text and
    illustrated graphically. Background in the form of some historical review and
    a brief overview of key SQL features is included.</p><p>NOTE 2 — In spite of the
    fact that the names of the ISO/IEC 9075 series of standards contain the phrase
    “database language”, the standards do not use the word “database” to describe
    the thing that SQL creates and on which it operates. The word “database” is used
    in many different contexts and has meanings wholly unrelated to the intent of
    the ISO/IEC 9075 series. Consequently, a variety of other terms are defined and
    used by the ISO/IEC 9075 series. The word “database” is frequently used in this
    document informally to mean “a collection of data managed by an SQL-implementation
    at any given time.”</p>"
