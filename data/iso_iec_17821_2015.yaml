abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17821:2015 defines the network specification for devices, which
    are operated on IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2011 PHY, capable to support the channel-hopped
    TDMA links of the DSME MAC of IEEE Std. 802.15.4e-2012, to provide low-cost communication
    network that allows reliable, deterministic-latency, and scalable wireless mesh
    connectivity.</p><p>This International Standard provides the following:</p><p>-
    DSME MAC link control;</p><p>- unbalanced cluster-tree based network formation;</p><p>-
    directional multiple grades mesh connection;</p><p>- link-path routing and data
    forwarding;</p><p>- link and link-path maintenance.</p>"
