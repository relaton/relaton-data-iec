abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 17821:2015 defines the
    network specification for devices, which are operated on IEEE Std. 802.15.4-2011
    PHY, capable to support the channel-hopped TDMA links of the DSME MAC of IEEE
    Std. 802.15.4e-2012, to provide low-cost communication network that allows reliable,
    deterministic-latency, and scalable wireless mesh connectivity.</p><p>This International
    Standard provides the following:</p><p>- DSME MAC link control;</p><p>- unbalanced
    cluster-tree based network formation;</p><p>- directional multiple grades mesh
    connection;</p><p>- link-path routing and data forwarding;</p><p>- link and link-path
    maintenance.</p>
