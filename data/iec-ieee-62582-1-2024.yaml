  content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-1:2024 contains requirements for application of the other
    parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 related to specific methods for condition monitoring in
    electrical equipment important to safety of nuclear power plants. It also includes
    requirements which are common to all methods. The procedures defined in IEC/IEEE
    62582 are intended for detailed condition monitoring.<br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 62582
    specifies condition monitoring methods in sufficient detail to enhance the accuracy
    and repeatability, and provide standard formats for reporting the results. The
    methods specified are applicable to electrical equipment containing polymeric
    materials. Some methods are especially designed for the measurement of condition
    of a limited range of equipment whilst others can be applied to all types of equipment
    for which the polymeric parts are accessible."
