abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000‑3. It does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The test methods
    intend to verify the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are
    implemented. This can, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further,
    application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general
    case.</p><p>This document includes the following interrogator and tag conformance
    parameters:</p><p>— mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values
    and tolerances;</p><p>— parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality
    and inter-operability.</p><p>This document does not include the following:</p><p>—
    parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;</p><p>—
    high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC
    15962).</p>"
