  content: "IEC TS 62876-3-1:2022(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the<br />\r\n• stability<br />\r\nof films of graphene-based material by a<br
    />\r\n• temperature and humidity test.<br />\r\nIt establishes a general methodology
    for reliability stress screening (RSS) to qualify the use of graphene-based material
    in its subsequent product value stage. The intention is to prepare test samples
    undergoing the same or similar failure mechanisms as the graphene-based material
    in the final product."
