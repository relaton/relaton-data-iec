abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-80-5:2024, which is a Technical Report, specifies the mapping
    rules for building and configuring a system using both IEC 61850 and IEC 61158-6
    (Industrial communication networks - Fieldbus specification, CPF Type 15, Modbus)
    protocols by utilizing gateways between IEC 61850 and IEC 61158-6 IEDs / subsystems.
    The objective is to enable operational run-time data exchange among these IEDs
    / subsystems, and to automate the configuration of a gateway as much as possible.<br
    />\r\nPlease note that for the purposes of this document, \"Modbus\" is used to
    represent both serial Modbus (Modbus RTU) and IEC 61158-6 (Modbus TCP).<br />\r\nWithin
    the capability of each protocol, some configuration attributes (IEC 61850-7-3:2010+AMD1:2020
    attributes with functional constraint CF) are also mapped in addition to the operational
    real-time data.<br />\r\nThe rules specified in this document are based on the
    published standards and do not make any proposed changes to IEC 61850 or 61158-6.
    This standard does not specify any rules for an IEC 61850 IED to directly communicate
    with a Modbus IED and vice versa, except through a gateway.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not mandate which data items that a particular IED shall support, regardless
    of whether the implementation uses Modbus or IEC 61850. Instead this document
    provides rules specifying how a gateway maps any given data item from one protocol
    to the other, given that the data item is already available and is transmitted
    using one of the protocols.<br />\r\nSimilarly, this document does not mandate
    which mapping rules a given gateway shall support. When this document is republished
    as a Technical Specification, conformance requirements will be identified.<br
    />\r\nThis document recognizes that there will be situations in which a user will
    require that a gateway perform non-standard protocol mappings. Non-standard mappings
    are outside the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document also recognizes
    that gateways typically manipulate the data passing through them in a variety
    of ways. Some of these functions include alarm trigger grouping, data suppression,
    interlocking and command blocking. Conformance to this document does not preclude
    a gateway from performing such functions, even though this document primarily
    specifies \"straight through\" mapping of Modbus data to IEC 61850-7-3:2010+AMD1:2020
    data. Subclause 7.4 of this document describes how some of these functions may
    be specified to a gateway by a mapping tool using equation notation in XML. However,
    some of these functions may be too complex for a mapping tool to specify in an
    automated manner.<br />\r\nThe mapping architecture for the exchange of the run-time
    information consists of four parts:<br />\r\n1) Conceptual architecture of a gateway
    and associated use case<br />\r\n2) Mapping of the information model (Assign semantic
    to the Modbus data)<br />\r\n3) Mapping of the data (which is in fact part of
    the information model)<br />\r\n4) Mapping of the services (out of scope for this
    document)"
