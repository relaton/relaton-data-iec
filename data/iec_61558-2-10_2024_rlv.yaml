abstract:
- content: "IEC 61558-2-10:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-10:2024
    deals with the safety of separating transformers with high insulation level and
    separating transformers with output voltages exceeding 1 000 V. Transformers incorporating
    electronic circuits are also covered by this document. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) adjustment of structure and references
    in accordance with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\nb) overvoltage categories I, II,
    III and IV for clearances and dielectric strength tests are included;<br />\r\nc)
    clearances for homogenous field conditions deleted.<br />\r\nIt has the status
    of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
