abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 specifies the concept of integrity levels with
    corresponding integrity level requirements that are required to be met in order
    to show the achievement of the integrity level. It places requirements on and
    recommends methods for defining and using integrity levels and their integrity
    level requirements, including the assignment of integrity levels to systems, software
    products, their elements, and relevant external dependences.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011
    is applicable to systems and software and is intended for use by:</p><ul><li>definers
    of integrity levels such as industry and professional organizations, standards
    organizations, and government agencies;</li><li>users of integrity levels such
    as developers and maintainers, suppliers and acquirers, users, and assessors of
    systems or software and for the administrative and technical support of systems
    and/or software products.</li></ul><p>One important use of integrity levels is
    by suppliers and acquirers in agreements; for example, to aid in assuring safety,
    economic, or security characteristics of a delivered system or product.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15026-3:2011 does not prescribe a specific set of integrity levels or their integrity
    level requirements. In addition, it does not prescribe the way in which integrity
    level use is integrated with the overall system or software engineering life cycle
    processes.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 can be used alone or with other parts of
    ISO/IEC 15026. It can be used with a variety of technical and specialized risk
    analysis and development approaches. ISO/IEC TR 15026-1 provides additional information
    and references to aid users of ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011.</p><p>Assurance cases are
    covered by ISO/IEC 15026-2. ISO/IEC 15026-3:2011 does not require the use of assurance
    cases but describes how integrity levels and assurance cases can work together,
    especially in the definition of specifications for integrity levels or by using
    integrity levels within a portion of an assurance case.</p>"
