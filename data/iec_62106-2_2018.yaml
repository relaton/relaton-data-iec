abstract:
- content: "IEC 62106-2:2018 defines the coding and definition of features for the
    Radio Data System (RDS).<br />\r\nIEC 62106-2:2018 together with IEC 62106-1,
    IEC 62106-3, IEC 62106-4, IEC 62106-5 and IEC 62106-6, cancels and replaces IEC
    62106:2015, and constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to IEC 62106:2015:<br
    />\r\n•    Provision has been made to carry RDS on multiple data-streams (RDS2).<br
    />\r\n•    Data in the additional data-streams is using a newly defined group
    type C data structure.<br />\r\n•    AF coding below 87,6 MHz (down to 64,1 MHz)
    using ODA-AID 0x6365 (see IEC 62106-6).<br />\r\n•    Long PS (UTF-8) support
    has been added using group type 15A.<br />\r\n•    Coding for the following applications
    is no longer detailed in the RDS standard as these can use in future the ODA concept:
    EWS, TDC, IH and RP.<br />\r\n•    Obsolete and no longer part of the RDS standard
    are: MS (Group 0A, 0B and 15B) certain DI codes (mono/stereo, artificial head,
    compression), Language code, and PIN (Group 1A)."
