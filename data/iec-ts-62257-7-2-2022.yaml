  content: "IEC TS 62257-7-2:2022 applies to all small wind turbines (SWTs) with a
    swept area smaller than or equal to 200 m<sup>2</sup>, and designed for supplying
    electrical power to isolated sites used in systems as described in IEC TS 62257-2.<br
    />\r\nThis document is not an exhaustive resource for the design, installation,
    operation or maintenance of small wind turbines and wind power systems, but is
    more focused on recommendations to provide strategies on selection and criteria
    which may affect the use of a small wind power system (SWPS) in a rural electrification
    project.<br />\r\nThe aim of this document is to provide users with the appropriate
    levels of reliability and safety of the equipment during its estimated service
    lifespan."
