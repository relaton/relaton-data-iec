  content: 'It describes symmetrical pair/quad cables intended for horizontal floor
    cabling in class D, E, EA, F and FA channels (Cat 5e, Cat 6, Cat 6A, Cat 7, Cat
    7A) as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and ISO/IEC 24702. It includes additional recommended
    environmental characteristics and severities, which are derived from the environmental
    classifications that are specified for cabling for industrial environments.  Includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    a) new requirements for new cables Cat6A, Cat7A, for 10 GBase-T applications;
    b) revised requirements and tests for the cables.'
