  content: "IEC 61156-1-4:2018 specifies a method to assess the thermal behaviour
    of cables arranged in bundles, for digital communications. A method is described
    to determine the temperature increase in cable bundles for certain remote powering
    currents as a basis to analyse the expected performance under several test arrangements
    described in standards dealing with the installation of cabling systems.<br />\r\nIt
    is only intended to provide guidance to assess the thermal behaviour of cables
    for digital communications in reference environmental conditions and arrangements.
    It is therefore not intended to become a type of test method.<br />\r\nThis first
    edition cancels and replaces IEC PAS 61156-1-4, published in 2010. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na)   Several test arrangements are considered;<br />\r\nb)   The
    mathematical approach was revised."
