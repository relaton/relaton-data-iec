abstract:
- content: "<p><strong>1.1 General</strong></p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 10514 specifies
    extensions to allow generic programming facilities to be added to the base Modula-2</p><p>language
    defined in International Standard ISO/IEC 10514-1 without altering the meaning
    of valid programs allowed by the</p><p>Base Language (except for the use of the
    new keyword introduced by this standard—see clause 5).</p><p><strong>1.2 Specifications
    included in this part of ISO/IEC 10514</strong></p><p>In addition to the specifications
    included in the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514 provides specifications
    for:</p><p>— required symbols for programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with
    Generic extensions;</p><p>— the lexical structure and semantics of programs written
    in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;</p><p>— the syntax of programs
    written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;</p><p>— violations of
    the rules for the use of the Generic extensions that a conforming implementation
    is required to detect;</p><p>— further compliance requirements for implementations,
    including documentation requirements.</p><p><strong>1.3 Relationship to ISO/IEC
    10514-1</strong></p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is part two of the multi-part
    Standard ISO/IEC 10514. This part of ISO/IEC 10514 extends and</p><p>modifies
    the Base Language ISO/IEC 10514-1, but the adoption of this part of ISO/IEC 10514
    is optional with respect to the</p><p>Base Language. This part of ISO/IEC 10514
    is also independent of any other parts of ISO/IEC 10514, except for part 1, and</p><p>can
    be adopted either together with or independently of such other parts.</p><p><strong>1.4
    Specifications not within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 10514</strong></p><p>In
    addition to the categories of specifications excluded by the Base Language this
    part of ISO/IEC 10514 provides no</p><p>specifications for:</p><p>— the method
    by which specific refinements are constructed from generic library modules;</p><p>—
    the method by which generic library modules, their associated refining modules,
    and the refinements produced by these are</p><p>stored (including any correspondence
    between the module names and system file names where files are used).</p>"
