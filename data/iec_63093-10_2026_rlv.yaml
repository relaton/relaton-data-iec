abstract:
- content: "IEC 63093-10:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 63093-10:2026
    specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical interchangeability
    for a preferred range of PM-cores made of magnetic oxides, the main dimensions
    for coil formers to be used with these cores and the locations of their pins on
    a modular printed wiring grid in relation to the base outlines of cores. It also
    specifies the effective parameter values to be used in calculations and gives
    guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable to the PM-cores.
    The use of derived standards which give more detailed specifications of component
    parts whilst still permitting compliance with this document is discussed in Annex
    A.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of Table 2 according
    to IEC 60205 ED4."
