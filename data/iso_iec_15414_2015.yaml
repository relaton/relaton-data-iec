- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 15414:2015 provides:

    a) a language (the enterprise language) comprising concepts, structures, and rules for developing, representing and reasoning about a specification of an ODP system from the enterprise viewpoint (as defined in Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3);

    b) rules which establish correspondences between the enterprise language and the other viewpoint languages (defined in Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3) to ensure the overall consistency of a specification.

    The language is specified to a level of detail sufficient to enable the determination of the compliance of any modelling language to this Recommendation | International Standard and to establish requirements for new specification techniques.

    ISO/IEC 15414:2015 is intended for use in preparing enterprise viewpoint specifications of ODP systems, and in developing notations and tools to support such specifications.

    As specified in clause 5 of Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3, an enterprise viewpoint specification defines the purpose, scope and policies of an ODP system.

    ISO/IEC 15414:2015 is a refinement and extension of Rec. ITU-T X.903 | ISO/IEC 10746-3, clauses 5 and 10, but does not replace them.
