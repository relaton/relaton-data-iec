  content: "IEC 61747-20-1:2015(E) gives the details of testing and provides general
    rules for visual inspection of the non-active and active area of monochrome liquid
    crystal display cells by the human eye, if necessary, through an optical microscope.
    Furthermore this standard includes defect definitions and the methods for visual
    defect inspection. This first edition cancels and replaces Clause 6 of the first
    edition of IEC 61747-5 published in 1998. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The editorial modifications were
    done in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, Ed 6.0:2011.<br />\r\nb)
    The document number was changed to align with the new numbering structure of the
    IEC 61747 series."
