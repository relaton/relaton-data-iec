abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23488:2022 This document specifies an image-based representation
    model that represents target objects/environments using a set of images and optionally
    the underlying 3D model for accurate and efficient objects/environments representation
    at an arbitrary viewpoint. It is applicable to a wide range of graphic, virtual
    reality and mixed reality applications which require the method of representing
    a scene with various objects and environments.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\n-
    defines terms for image-based representation and 3D reconstruction techniques;<br
    />\r\n- specifies the required elements for image-based representation;<br />\r\n-
    specifies a method of representing the real world in the virtual space based on
    image-based representation;<br />\r\n- specifies how visible image patches can
    be integrated with the underlying 3D model for more accurate and rich objects/environments
    representation from arbitrary viewpoints;<br />\r\n- specifies how the proposed
    model allows multi-object representation;<br />\r\n- provides an XML based specification
    of the proposed representation model and an actual implementation example (see
    Annex A)."
