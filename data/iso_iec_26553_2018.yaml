- content: "<p>This document, within the context of tools and methods of detailed
    design and implementation for software and system product lines<strong>:</strong></p><p>—
    provides the terms and definitions specific to realization for software and systems
    product lines;</p><p>— defines processes performed during product line realization
    (those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes);</p><p>—
    defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process; and</p><p>—
    defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.</p><p>This
    document concerns processes and capabilities of realization tools and methods
    for a family of products, not for a single system.</p>"
