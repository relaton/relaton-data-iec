abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2012 provides information about the Microsoft® Windows®
    Automation Frameworks, including Microsoft Active Accessibility, User Interface
    (UI) Automation, and the common interfaces of these accessibility frameworks including
    the IAccessibleEx interface specification. It provides information on application
    programming interfaces (APIs) needed to use these frameworks.A primary goal of
    ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2012 is to ensure that accessible software applications can
    be written in such a way that they are fully compatible with the Microsoft Accessibility
    APIs available on the Microsoft Windows operating system.
