abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010 specifies three digital signature schemes giving message
    recovery, two of which are deterministic (non-randomized) and one of which is
    randomized. The security of all three schemes is based on the difficulty of factorizing
    large numbers. All three schemes can provide either total or partial message recovery.ISO/IEC
    9796-2:2010 specifies the method for key production for the three signature schemes.
    However, techniques for key management and for random number generation (as required
    for the randomized signature scheme), are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010.The
    first mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010 is only applicable for existing
    implementations, and is retained for reasons of backward compatibility.
