abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010 specifies three digital signature schemes giving
    message recovery, two of which are deterministic (non-randomized) and one of which
    is randomized. The security of all three schemes is based on the difficulty of
    factorizing large numbers. All three schemes can provide either total or partial
    message recovery.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010 specifies the method for key production
    for the three signature schemes. However, techniques for key management and for
    random number generation (as required for the randomized signature scheme), are
    outside the scope of ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010.</p><p>The first mechanism specified
    in ISO/IEC 9796-2:2010 is only applicable for existing implementations, and is
    retained for reasons of backward compatibility.</p>"
