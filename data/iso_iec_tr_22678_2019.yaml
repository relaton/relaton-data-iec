abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance on the use of international standards
    as a tool in the development of those policies that govern or regulate cloud service
    providers (CSPs) and cloud services, and those policies and practices that govern
    the use of cloud services in organisations.</p><p>This includes material that
    explains cloud computing concepts and the role of cloud computing international
    standards in formulating policies and practices.</p><p>The document makes references
    to various international standards. Where possible, these standards are ISO/IEC
    standards. Where a suitable ISO/IEC standard is not available, references are
    made to documents published by other WTO-registered standards bodies.</p><p>As
    explained in the WTO Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT), standards
    play a vital role in supporting technical regulations and conformity assessment,
    however this document does not cover matters of trade.</p>"
