abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165-314:2013(E) defines the FC-AE-RDMA Upper Level Protocol.
    FC-AE-RDMA follows the SCSI-3 FCP standard in its definition of the services necessary
    to support low latency, low overhead communication between elements of a mission-critical
    avionics system. FC-AE-RDMA is intended to support bi-directional communication
    between two N_Ports in a constrained and carefully defined environment, typical
    of avionics applications. The intended usage is avionic command, control, instrumentation,
    simulation, signal processing and sensor&#x2F;video data distribution. These application
    areas are characterized by a variety of requirements, among them a need for high
    reliability, fault tolerance and deterministic behaviour to support real-time
    control&#x2F;response.
