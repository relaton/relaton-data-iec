    <p>ISO/IEC 33002:2015 defines the minimum set of requirements for performing an assessment that will ensure assessment results are objective, consistent, repeatable, and representative of the assessed processes.</p>
    <p>The requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33002:2015 can be used by or on behalf of an organization to</p>
    <p>a)    facilitate self-assessment,</p>
    <p>b)    provide a basis for improving process performance and mitigating process-related risk,</p>
    <p>c)    produce a rating of the achievement of the relevant process quality characteristic, and</p>
    <p>d)    provide an objective benchmark between organizations.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 33002:2015 is applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization.</p>
