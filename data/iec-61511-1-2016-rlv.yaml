  content: "IEC 61511-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61511-1:2016 gives
    requirements for the specification, design, installation, operation and maintenance
    of a safety instrumented system (SIS), so that it can be confidently entrusted
    to achieve or maintain a safe state of the process. IEC 61511-1 has been developed
    as a process sector implementation of IEC 61508:2010.<br />\r\nThe contents of
    the corrigendum of September 2016 have been included in this copy."
