  content: "IEC TR 61292-4:2023 which is a Technical Report, applies to all commercially
    available optical amplifiers (OAs), including optical fibre amplifiers (OFAs)
    using active fibres as well as Raman amplifiers. Semiconductor optical amplifiers
    (SOAs) using semiconductor gain media are also included. This document provides
    informative guidelines on the threshold of high optical power that can cause high-temperature
    damage of the fibre. Also discussed is optical safety for manufacturers and users
    of optical amplifiers by quoting parts of existing standards and agreements on
    eye and skin safety. This document identifies the following values for maximum
    permissible optical power in the optical amplifier for damage-free and safe operation:<br
    />\r\n- the optical power limit that causes thermal damage to the fibre, such
    as fibre fuse and fibre-coat burning;<br />\r\n- the maximum permissible exposure
    (MPE) to which the eyes/skin can be exposed without consequent injury;<br />\r\n-
    the optical power limit in the fibre that causes MPE on the eyes/skin after free-space
    propagation from the fibre;<br />\r\n- the absolute allowable optical power level
    for damage-free and safe operation of the optical amplifier by comparing a) and
    c).<br />\r\nThe objective of this document is to minimize potential confusion
    and misunderstanding in the industry that can cause unnecessary alarms and hinder
    the progress and acceptance of advancing optical amplifier technologies in the
    market. It is important that the reader always refers to the latest international
    standards and agreements, because the technologies concerned are rapidly evolving.
    The present document will be frequently reviewed and updated in a timely manner
    by incorporating the results of various studies related to OAs and OA-supported
    optical systems. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br
    />\r\na) The technical information has been updated to reflect revisions of the
    relevant references.<br />\r\nb) In particular, the descriptions provided in Clause
    5 and Clause 6 have been modified significantly to reflect changes in the cited
    references. Unnecessary formulas and explanations that overlap with the references
    have been removed to simplify the document.<br />\r\nc) New information has been
    added to Annex A on optical fibre burning when light enters an optical fibre with
    a bubble train formed by a fibre fuse."
