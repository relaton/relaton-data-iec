abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11179-1:2015 provides the means for understanding and associating
    the individual parts of ISO/IEC 11179 and is the foundation for a conceptual understanding
    of metadata and metadata registries.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 11179-1:2015 is applicable
    to the formulation of data representations, concepts, meanings and relationships
    to be shared among people and machines, independent of the organization that produces
    the data. It is not applicable to the physical representation of data as bits
    and bytes at the machine level.<br /><br />\r\nIn this part of ISO/IEC 11179-1:2015
    (and all other parts), metadata refers to descriptions of data. It does not contain
    a general treatment of metadata.<br /><br />\r\nThe electronic version of this
    International Standard can be downloaded from the ISO/IEC Information Technology
    Task Force (ITTF) website."
