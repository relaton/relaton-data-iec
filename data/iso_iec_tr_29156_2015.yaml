abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 29156:2015 provides guidance on specifying performance requirements
    for authentication using biometric recognition in order to achieve desired levels
    of security and usability for the authentication mechanism.<p>Guidance addresses
    issues such as the following:</p><p>- the biometric performance metrics that impact
    security and usability;</p><p>- comparing and quantifying the security and usability
    of biometrics and other authentication mechanisms, when used alone or in combination;</p><p>-
    how to combine performance of individual authentication elements in order to meet
    an overall security and usability requirement;</p><p>- the trade-off between security
    and usability in applications using biometric recognition;</p><p>- considerations
    in maintaining security and usability in systems incorporating biometrics.</p><p>The
    guidance is targeted towards applications that</p><p>- use biometrics for the
    authentication of individuals, and</p><p>- are of small to medium size (in terms
    of the number of enrolled individuals).</p><p>The guidance does not address the
    following:</p><p>- surveillance systems;</p><p>- systems whose primary aim is
    to detect and prevent attempts by individuals to create multiple enrolments under
    different identities;</p><p>- systems with a large and diverse population of enrolees,
    which can include people with special needs;</p><p>- other systems with a complex
    mix of functional, security and usability requirements.</p><p>Such large-scale
    applications are typically the domain of large organizations, and it is assumed
    that the developers of such systems will have access to appropriate biometric
    expertise able to provide guidance beyond the scope of this Technical Report.</p><p>This
    Technical Report does not address biometric modality and technology specific issues,
    nor does it provide quantitative biometric performance requirements that would
    satisfy a particular application.</p>
