abstract:
- content: IEC TR  62453-51-10:2017(E) which is a Technical Report, provides additional
    information for integrating the Foundationâ„¢ Fieldbus (FF) protocol into the COM-based
    implementation of the FDT Specification (IEC TR 62453-41). This document describes
    communication definitions, protocol specific extensions and the means for block
    (e.g. transducer, resource or function blocks) representation. This document cancels
    and replaces IEC TR 62453-501 published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. The main changes are updates of the methods to access instance and device
    data (see Clause 5) and updates of the XML schemas (see Clauses 7to 11).
