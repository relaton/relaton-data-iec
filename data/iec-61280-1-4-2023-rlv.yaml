  content: "IEC 61280-1-4:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61280-1-4:2023
    establishes the characterization process of the encircled flux measurement method
    of light sources intended to be used with multimode fibre. This document sets
    forth a procedure for the collection of two-dimensional fibre optic nearfield
    greyscale data and subsequent reduction to one-dimensional data expressed as a
    set of three sampled parametric functions of radius from the fibre’s optical centre.
    Estimation of the fibre core diameter is not an objective of this document. This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    improvement of calibration procedure and calibration traceability;<br />\r\n-
    improvement of fibre shaker description and requirements;<br />\r\n- addition
    of pulsed light sources;<br />\r\n- removal of a poorly traceable calibration
    process using a micro positioner."
