abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62735-2: 2016(E) applies to plugs and fixed socket-outlets for
    class I equipment with two active contacts plus an earthing contact, a rated power
    of 5,2 kW and a rated voltage range from 294 V to 400 V d.c. They are intended
    to power d.c. information and communication technology equipment only. The 2,6
    kW system complying with Part 1 is safely compatible with the system complying
    with this part as it is possible to insert the 2,6 kW plug in the 5,2 kW socket-outlet
    but it is not possible to insert the 5,2 kW plug into the 2,6 kW socket-outlet.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC TS 62735-1:2015"
