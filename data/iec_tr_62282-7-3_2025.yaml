abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62282-7-3:2025 is a generic assessment of the feasibility of standardizing
    accelerated test procedures (both proton exchange membrane (PEM) and oxide ion-conducting
    solid oxide cell (SOC) technologies) for fuel cell stacks that have been engineered
    for a specific system application. This document comprises a review of literature
    and projects, a discussion of the main physical phenomena of interest in accelerated
    testing campaigns (focusing on the cell and stack levels, not looking at the system
    as a black box), a compendium of measurement techniques that are applicable, and
    it suggests a macroscopic approach to the formulation of a representative accelerated
    testing campaign.
