abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-20-11:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [14].</p><p>This service-type enables modeling of streaming capabilities
    of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between devices. Each device
    that is able to send or receive a stream according to the UPnP AV Architecture
    will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This service provides a
    mechanism for control points to:</p><p>a) Perform capability matching between
    source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,</p><p>b) Find information about
    currently ongoing transfers in the network,</p><p>c) Setup and teardown connections
    between devices (when required by the streaming protocol).</p><p>The ConnectionManager
    service is generic enough to properly abstract different kinds of streaming mechanisms,
    such as HTTP-based streaming, RTSP/RTP-based and 1394-based streaming.</p><p>The
    ConnectionManager enables control points to abstract from physical media interconnect
    technology when making connections. The term?stream' used in this service template
    refers to both analog and digital data transfer.</p>"
