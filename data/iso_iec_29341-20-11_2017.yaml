abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-20-11:2017 is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [14].<br
    />\r\nThis service-type enables modeling of streaming capabilities of A/V devices,
    and binding of those capabilities between devices. Each device that is able to
    send or receive a stream according to the UPnP AV Architecture will have 1 instance
    of the ConnectionManager service. This service provides a mechanism for control
    points to:<br />\r\na) Perform capability matching between source/server devices
    and sink/renderer devices,<br />\r\nb) Find information about currently ongoing
    transfers in the network,<br />\r\nc) Setup and teardown connections between devices
    (when required by the streaming protocol).<br />\r\nThe ConnectionManager service
    is generic enough to properly abstract different kinds of streaming mechanisms,
    such as HTTP-based streaming, RTSP/RTP-based and 1394-based streaming.<br />\r\nThe
    ConnectionManager enables control points to abstract from physical media interconnect
    technology when making connections. The term?stream' used in this service template
    refers to both analog and digital data transfer."
