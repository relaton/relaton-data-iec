    and testing of installed optical fibre cabling designed in accordance with premises
    cabling standards including ISO/IEC 11801, ISO/IEC 24764, ISO/IEC 24702 and ISO/IEC
    15018. The test methods refer to existing standards-based procedures where they

    2006 and its Amendment 1:2009. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following changes:<br />\r\n- general requirements have been revised;<br
    />\r\n- OTDR characterization (6.2) and requirements for cabling interface adapters
    and test cords have been revised;<br />\r\n- enhanced three-test-cord reference
    method has been introduced;<br />\r\n- information on optical time domain reflectometry
    (Annex C) has been revised;<br />\r\n- examples of calculations of channel and
    permanent link limits (Annex G) have been revised and information regarding cleaning
    and inspection of fibre optic connections have been added (Annex H).<br />\r\nThe
