  content: "IEC TS 63384-1:2023 provides guidance for power system stability control
    framework design. It covers the uniform use of terms and definitions, general
    objectives and principles for power system stability control, the classification
    of power system stability control, and the framework combining several types of
    stability controls in a coordinated and cost-effective (risk-based) manner.<br
    />\r\nIn accordance with this guideline, the framework is designed to cope with
    disturbances of different probabilities of occurrence and impact on power system
    security and stability. Effective control approaches are designed to prevent or
    minimize the scope of future blackouts."
