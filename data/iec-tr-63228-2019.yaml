  content: "IEC TR 63228:2019 summarises present perspectives on the performance evaluation
    of emerging PV technologies, specifically OPV, DSC and PSC devices. These devices
    present some challenges for accurate measurement under the existing IEC 60904
    series of standards, which were developed in the context of silicon wafer solar
    cells. These challenges can be different for different devices, but in general
    they arise due to one or more of the following:<br />\r\n- instability in performance
    over time;<br />\r\n- unusual spectral responsivity;<br />\r\n- small device size;
    difficulty in measuring temperature;<br />\r\n- a transient response to external
    stimulus;<br />\r\n- optical interference effects; and<br />\r\n- a non-linear
    current response to irradiance. These challenges can lead to the cell output in
    laboratory testing being significantly different to the output that would be observed
    in a real application.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe primary focus of the report is measurement
    of the current-voltage (<em>I‑V</em>) relationship under illumination for the
    purpose of determining the device output power, or power conversion efficiency.
    Where appropriate, the report makes reference to the IEC 60904 series which describes
    the standard approach to measuring the performance of all PV devices. The report
    also references existing published standards that seek to accommodate OPV, DSC
    or PSC devices."
