  content: "IEC 61097-9:2025 specifies the minimum operational and performance requirements
    and test methods with required test results for transmitters and receivers capable
    of voice communication and digital selective calling for the GMDSS operating in
    either the medium frequency band only or in medium and high frequency bands allocated
    in the ITU Radio Regulations to the Maritime Mobile Service, as required by Chapter
    IV of SOLAS 1974 as amended. It is based on IMO resolution MSC.512(105) and takes
    account of Recommendation ITU-R M.493 for digital selective calling including
    the automatic connection system.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been updated to incorporate
    the provisions of the new IMO performance standards given in Resolution MSC.512(105)
    and new ITU-R recommendations given in M.493-16. These provisions in particular
    add new requirements for reception of maritime safety information and for the
    automatic connection system;<br />\r\nb) the provisions for digital selective
    calling which were previously in IEC 61097-3 have been incorporated;<br />\r\nc)
    the provisions for watch keeping receivers which were previously in IEC 61097-8
    have been incorporated;<br />\r\nd) new requirements have been added for software
    maintenance in 4.10 in support of IMO recommendations;<br />\r\ne) new Annex A,
    Annex B and Annex C have been added for digital selective calling;<br />\r\nf)
    new Annex D and Annex G have been added for bridge alert management;<br />\r\ng)
    new Annex E and Annex I have been added for maritime safety information;<br />\r\nh)
    a new Annex F has been added for the automatic connection system;<br />\r\ni)
    a new Annex H has been added for equipment manuals;<br />\r\nj) a new Annex J
    has been added for remote control operation;<br />\r\nk) previous Annex A, Annex
    B and Annex C have been deleted as they are no longer relevant."
