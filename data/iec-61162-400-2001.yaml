  content: This standard series, IEC 61162-400 and upwards, specifies a communication
    protocol for use in interconnected maritime systems. Specifies an interface description
    language for use together with the protocol, a set of rules for the use of this
    language and a set of standard interfaces described in the language. Provides
    a test plan and list of required documents for equipment using this standard.
    This part of IEC 61162 gives a general overview of the functionality of the protocol
    and provides definitions common to the other fragments of the standard.
