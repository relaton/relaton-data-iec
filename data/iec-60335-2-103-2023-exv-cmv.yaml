  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-103:2023 EXV and IEC 60355-2-103:2023 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-103:2023 deals with the safety of electric drives
    for horizontally and vertically moving gates, doors, garage doors and windows
    for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase drives and 600 V for other drives including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances. It also covers the hazards
    associated with the movement of the driven part.<br />\r\nDrives not intended
    for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the
    public, such as drives intended to be used by laymen in shops, offices, hotels,
    restaurants, hospitals, in industry and on farms, are within the scope of this
    standard.<br />\r\nRequirements for drives for doors that can be used in emergency
    routes and exits are given in normative Annex AA.<br />\r\nExamples of drives
    within the scope of this standard are drives for<br />\r\n– folding doors;<br
    />\r\n– revolving doors;<br />\r\n– rolling doors;<br />\r\n– roof windows;<br
    />\r\n– sectional overhead doors;<br />\r\n– swinging and sliding gates or doors.<br
    />\r\nDrives can be supplied with a driven part.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by drives that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    drive safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with
    the drive.<br />\r\nFor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary. In many countries,
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to drives<br />\r\n– for vertically moving garage doors for residential use (60335-2-95);<br
    />\r\n– for shutters covering doors and windows (including locations where the
    door is set back from the shutter), awnings, blinds and similar equipment (60335-2-97);<br
    />\r\n– intended exclusively to be used by trained persons in commercial and industrial
    premises;<br />\r\n– for specific purposes, such as fire doors;<br />\r\n– for
    natural smoke exhaust ventilators not used as windows (ISO 21927-2);<br />\r\n–
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to movement of a pedestrian door where such movement is
    based solely on stored energy.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2015, Amendment 1:2017 and Amendment 2:2019. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) scope includes DC-supplied
    appliances and battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) some notes
    have been converted to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) additional requirements
    for installation instructions have been incorporated (7.12);<br />\r\ne) application
    of test probe 18 and test probe 19 have been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2, Annexes
    BB, CC and DD);<br />\r\nf) addition of surface temperatures for external accessible
    surfaces (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ng) requirements for loading accessible appliance
    outlets and socket outlets have been added (11.7);<br />\r\nh) requirements for
    appliances incorporating integral batteries or separable batteries have been added
    (11.7);<br />\r\ni) requirements have been added for drives intended for permanent
    connection delivered with a connector to ease the installation (22.108, 24.101,
    25.3).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
