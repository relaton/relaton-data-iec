abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24789-1:2011 comprises a methodology for determining application
    profiles, their requirements and corresponding examples. It contains no additional
    or changed requirements for the ID card properties defined in other applicable
    standards. It seeks to define the relative rigour of each application defined
    herein in terms of a set of simple but justifiable methods of evaluation.</p><p>The
    purpose of ISO/IEC 24789 is to provide guidance on methods and their use to simulate
    a card's service life. In order to achieve this purpose, two parameters of card
    service life are defined: age and usage. This can be represented as a twoâ€‘dimensional
    matrix in which each age/usage combination corresponds to a card service life
    class. The two parts of ISO/IEC 24789 together describe the evaluation methods
    to be used and their criteria.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24789 was originally developed for
    ID-1 cards conforming to ISO/IEC 7810, but might be found useful in whole or in
    part for other types and form factors.</p><p>References are given to the corresponding
    methods of evaluation in ISO/IEC 24789-2 and elsewhere.</p>"
