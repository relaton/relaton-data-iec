abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-90-3:2016(E) addresses communication aspects related to specific
    sensor networks that are widely used as well as information exchange towards asset
    management systems. Since the outcome of this work will affect several parts of
    IEC 61850, in a first step, this technical report has been prepared to address
    the topic from an application specific viewpoint across all affected parts of
    IEC 61850. Once this technical report has been approved, the affected parts of
    the standard will be amended with the results from the report. This approach is
    similar to what is done as an example with IEC 61850-90-1 for the communication
    between substations.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of November 2020
    have been included in this copy."
