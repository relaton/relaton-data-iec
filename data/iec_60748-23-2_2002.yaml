    Applies to high quality approval systems for hybrid integrated circuits and film structures.
    The purpose of the tests is to perform visual inspections on the internal materials, construction and workmanship of hybrid, multichip and multichip module microcircuits and passive elements used for microelectronic applications including r.f./microwave.
    These tests will normally be used on microelectronic devices prior to capping or encapsulation to detect and eliminate devices with internal non-conformances that could lead to device failure in normal application. They may also be employed on a sampling basis to determine the effectiveness of the manufacturers' quality control and handling procedures.
