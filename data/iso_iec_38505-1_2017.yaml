abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 38505-1:2017 provides guiding principles for members of governing
    bodies of organizations (which can comprise owners, directors, partners, executive
    managers, or similar) on the effective, efficient, and acceptable use of data
    within their organizations by</p><p>- applying the governance principles and model
    of ISO/IEC 38500 to the governance of data,</p><p>- assuring stakeholders that,
    if the principles and practices proposed by this document are followed, they can
    have confidence in the organization's governance of data,</p><p>- informing and
    guiding governing bodies in the use and protection of data in their organization,
    and</p><p>- establishing a vocabulary for the governance of data.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    38505-1:2017 can also provide guidance to a wider community, including:</p><p>-
    executive managers,</p><p>- external businesses or technical specialists, such
    as legal or accounting specialists, retail or industrial associations, or professional
    bodies,</p><p>- internal and external service providers (including consultants),
    and</p><p>- auditors.</p><p>While this document looks at the governance of data
    and its use within an organization, guidance on the implementation arrangement
    for the effective governance of IT in general is found in ISO/IEC/TS 38501. The
    constructs in ISO/IEC/TS 38501 can help to identify internal and external factors
    relating to the governance of IT and help to define beneficial outcomes and identify
    evidence of success.</p><p>ISO/IEC 38505-1:2017 applies to the governance of the
    current and future use of data that is created, collected, stored or controlled
    by IT systems, and impacts the management processes and decisions relating to
    data.</p><p>ISO/IEC 38505-1:2017 defines the governance of data as a subset or
    domain of the governance of IT, which itself is a subset or domain of organizational,
    or in the case of a corporation, corporate governance.</p><p>ISO/IEC 38505-1:2017
    is applicable to all organizations, including public and private companies, government
    entities, and not-for-profit organizations. This document is applicable to organizations
    of all sizes from the smallest to the largest, regardless of the extent of their
    dependence on data.</p>"
