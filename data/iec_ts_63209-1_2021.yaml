abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63209-1:2021 is intended to provide information to supplement the
    baseline testing defined in IEC 61215, which is a qualification test with pass-fail
    criteria. This document provides a standardized method for evaluating longer term
    reliability of photovoltaic (PV) modules and for different bills of materials
    (BOMs) that may be used when manufacturing those modules. The included test sequences
    in this specification are intended to provide information for comparative qualitative
    analysis using stresses relevant to application exposures to target known failure
    modes.
