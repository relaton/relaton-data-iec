abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-21-4:2025 specifies a uniform methodology, defining measurement,
    testing and assessment procedures of electrical characteristics of wind turbine
    components and subsystems, as basis for the verification of the electrical capabilities
    of wind turbines and wind turbine families.<br />\r\nThis document includes the
    following aspects:<br />\r\n- definitions of test bench, subsystems and interface;<br
    />\r\n- definitions of system requirements for the test bench to perform relevant
    measurements (grid strengths, short circuit power, THD, â€¦);<br />\r\n- measurement
    procedures for quantifying the electrical characteristics;<br />\r\n- test and
    measurement procedures for verifying and validating the electrical characteristics
    of components and subsystems in relation to grid compliance requirements;<br />\r\n-
    procedures for the transferability of the component and subsystem test results,
    measured at the test bench, to WT product families;<br />\r\n- documentation requirements
    and validation procedures of components, subsystems and wind turbines.<br />\r\nThe
    results of the measurements and assessments of the wind turbine components and
    subsystems will be used as input for the verification of electrical capabilities
    as described in IEC 61400-21-1 and for the validation and verification of the
    electrical simulation models for wind power plants (WPP) as described in IEC 61400-27."
