abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 is available as IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018
    contains a series of recommendations developed by an expert working group of IEC
    subcommittee 62A in response to questions of interpretation of IEC 60601-1:2005
    and related collateral standards in the IEC 60601 series. IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018
    is primarily intended to be used by:<br />\r\n– manufacturers of medical electrical
    equipment;<br />\r\n– test laboratories and others responsible for assessment
    of compliance with IEC 60601 1:2005, IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012, IEC 60601-1-8:2006,
    IEC 60601-1-8:2006/AMD1:2012, IEC 60601-1-11:2010, IEC 60601 1 11:2015 and IEC
    60601-1-12:2014;<br />\r\n– those developing subsequent editions of IEC 60601-1.<br
    />\r\nThe recommendations in the first edition of IEC TR 62296 were considered
    in preparing the third edition of IEC 60601-1. Similarly, it is expected that
    these recommendations within IEC 60601-4-3 will be considered when preparing future
    revisions of IEC 60601-1 and related collateral standards in the IEC 60601 series.
    The object of IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 is to make the recommendations/interpretations
    available to those interested in the application of the third edition of IEC 60601-1
    and applicable collateral standards. IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 cancels and replaces
    the first edition of IEC 60601-4-3 published in 2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: addition of 47 new recommendations."
