abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-4:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61196-4:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61196-4:2015
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 46A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61196-4:2022 applies to radiating coaxial communication cables,
    and specifies the terms and definitions, material and construction, IEC type designation,
    standard rating and characteristics, identification, marking and labelling, requirements
    of finished cables, quality assessment, delivery and storage, etc.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2015 This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na. rewrote \"1 Scope\" to be consistent with other blank detail
    specifications of coaxial cables;\r\nb. updated different standards in \"Clause
    2 Normative references\";\r\n\r\nc. added the definitions of uniformly radiating
    type cable, stop frequency band and link loss;\r\n\r\nd. added different materials
    and constructions in 4.2 to 4.5;\r\n\r\ne. added \"Clause 5 IEC type designation\";\r\n\r\nf.
    added a detailed rated temperature range of different materials in \"6.2 Rated
    temperature range\";\r\n\r\ng. added detailed frequencies in \"6.3 Operating frequency
    range\";\r\n\r\nh. added \"6.4 Stop frequency band\" and \"6.5 Radiating characteristics\";\r\n\r\ni.
    added different detail requirements or typical values in 8.2.4, 8.2.7, 8.2.8,
    8.4.3 to 8.4.8;\r\n\r\nj. deleted \"7.4.4 Ovality of outer conductor\";\r\n\r\nk.
    added \"8.2.11 Link loss\", \"8.4.9 Adhesion of dielectric\", \"8.4.10 Shrinkage
    for insulations\", \"8.4.11 Maximum pulling force of cable\";<br />\r\ni. used
    IEC 61196-1-123 and IEC 61196-1-124 in the electrical requirements to replace
    Annex A and Annex B respectively and deleted Annex A and Annex B;\r\n\r\nm. added
    \"Figure A.1 Example of testing coupling loss around circumferential orientation
    of radiating cable (Y-Z)\" in Annex A."
