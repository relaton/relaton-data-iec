  content: ISO 18080-3:2015 specifies a test method using manual friction with measurement
    of frictional charge density on specimens of fabric. The test method is suitable
    for fabrics of all types of composition and construction that are capable of withstanding
    frictional charging. Some fabrics, e.g. fabrics of low strength or loose construction,
    may not be physically capable of withstanding the manual friction used in this
    test method or may give false results. In such cases, the test method described
    in ISO 18080-1 can be used to evaluate electrostatic propensity. The test method
    described may not be suitable for evaluating garments and garment materials in
    relation to safety of personnel and protection of electrostatic discharge sensitive
    devices.
