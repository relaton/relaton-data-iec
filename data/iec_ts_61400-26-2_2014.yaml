abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-26-2:2014 provides a framework from which production-based
    performance indicators of a wind turbine generator system can be derived. It unambiguously
    describes how data is categorised and provides examples of how the data can be
    used to derive performance indicators. The approach of this part of IEC 61400
    is to expand the time allocation model, introduced in IEC TS 61400-26-1, with
    two additional layers for recording of the actual energy production and potential
    energy production associated with the concurrent time allocation. This document
    also includes informative annexes with:<br />\r\n- examples of determination of
    lost production,<br />\r\n- examples of algorithms for production-based indicators,<br
    />\r\n- examples of other performance indicators,<br />\r\n- examples of application
    scenarios."
