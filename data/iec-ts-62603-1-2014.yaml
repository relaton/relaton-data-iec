  content: IEC TS 62603-1:2014 describes methods and provides guidance for the evaluation
    of Process Control Systems (PCS) during the phase of selection between different
    proposals. The methods of evaluation proposed in this technical specification
    are intended for use mainly by users, engineering companies, or independent test
    laboratories, to verify manufacturers' proposals during the tender (as described
    in IEC 62603-1) or the provided Process Control System during the FAT procedure.
