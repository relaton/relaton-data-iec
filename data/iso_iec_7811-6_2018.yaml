abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 7811 defines the characteristics for identification cards as defined
    in Clause 3 of this document and the use of such cards for international interchange.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies requirements for a high coercivity magnetic stripe
    (including any protective overlay) on an identification card, the encoding technique
    and coded character sets. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects
    and states minimum requirements.<br />\r\nCoercivity influences many of the quantities
    specified in this document but is not itself specified. The main characteristic
    of the high coercivity magnetic stripe is its improved resistance to erasure.
    This is achieved with minimal probability of damage to other magnetic stripes
    by contact while retaining read compatibility with magnetic stripes as defined
    in ISO/IEC 7811-2.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 7811 provides criteria to which cards are
    to perform. No consideration is given within ISO/IEC 7811 to the amount of use,
    if any, experienced by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified
    criteria is negotiated between the involved parties.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 10373-2
    specifies the test procedures used to check cards against the parameters specified
    in this document.<br />\r\nNOTE Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial measurement
    system in this document may have been rounded off and are consistent with, but
    not exactly equal to each other. Using either system is correct but intermixing
    or reconverting values can result in errors. The original design was made using
    the Imperial measurement system."
