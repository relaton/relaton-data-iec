abstract:
- content: Defines generic requirements, which govern SCSI-3 implementation standards,
    and implementation requirements that apply to all SCSI-3 devices. Implementation
    requirements specify behavior in terms of measurable or observable parameters
    pertaining to an implementation. Generic requirements are transformed to implementation
    requirements by an implementation standard. This standard contains a reference
    model for the coordination of standards applicable to SCSI-3 I&#x2F;O systems
    and a set of common behavioral requirements that are essential for the development
    of host software and device firmware that can interoperate with any SCSI-3 interconnect
    or protocol.
