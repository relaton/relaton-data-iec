abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18033-2:2006 specifies encryption systems (ciphers) for the
    purpose of data confidentiality. The primary purpose of encryption (or<em>encipherment</em>)
    techniques is to protect the confidentiality of stored or transmitted data. An
    encryption algorithm is applied to data (often called<em>plaintext</em> or<em>cleartext</em>)
    to yield encrypted data (or<em>ciphertext</em>); this process is known as<em>encryption</em>.
    The encryption algorithm should be designed so that the ciphertext yields no information
    about the plaintext except, perhaps, its length. Associated with every encryption
    algorithm is a corresponding<em>decryption algorithm</em>, which transforms ciphertext
    back into its original plaintext.</p><p>An asymmetric, i.e. public-key, encryption
    scheme allows a sender to use a recipient's public key to transmit an encryption
    of a message to the receiver, who can use his secret key to decrypt the given
    ciphertext, thereby obtaining the original message.</p><p>Such a scheme should
    be secure in the sense that no information about the message should be leaked
    to a (resource-bounded) attacker, even if that attacker mounts a so-called 'chosen
    ciphertext' attack, in which he may obtain decryptions of other ciphertexts. This
    is the strongest type of attack that has been proposed for a public-key encryption
    scheme.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18033-2:2006 specifies the functional interface of such
    a scheme, and in addition specifies a number of particular schemes that appear
    to be secure against chosen ciphertext attack. The different schemes offer different
    trade-offs between security properties and efficiency.</p>"
