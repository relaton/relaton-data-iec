  content: "IEC 60670-24:2024 applies to enclosures and parts of them for housing
    protective devices and other power dissipating electrical equipment intended to
    be used with a rated voltage not exceeding 400 V and a total incoming load current
    not exceeding 125 A for household and similar fixed electrical installations.
    These enclosures are intended to be installed in locations where unskilled persons
    have access. They are intended to be equipped with electrical equipment by skilled
    persons (installers). These enclosures are intended to be installed where the
    prospective short circuit current does not exceed 10 kA unless they are protected
    by current limiting protective devices with a cut-off current not exceeding 17
    kA. Enclosures complying with this document are suitable for use at ambient temperature
    not normally exceeding 40 °C, but their average temperature over a period of 24
    h does not exceed 35 °C, with a lower limit of the ambient air temperature of
    −5 °C. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) revision of requirements for protection against electric shock in Clause
    10;<br />\r\nb) addition of requirements for functional earthing in 11.101;<br
    />\r\nc) revision of the requirements for fixing of flush type and semi-flush
    type enclosures in 12.12;<br />\r\nd) revision of the requirements for resistance
    of insulating material to abnormal heat and to fire in Clause 18;<br />\r\ne)
    addition of calculations to take into account the power loss of electronic devices
    in Clause AA.6;<br />\r\nf) addition of tests and requirements for enclosures
    exposed to direct sunlight with the related Annex CC;<br />\r\ng) addition of
    tests and requirements for enclosures with separate area to accommodate multimedia-equipment
    with the related Annex DD;<br />\r\nh) addition of tests and requirements for
    enclosures used with connected devices or equipment with the related Annex EE."
