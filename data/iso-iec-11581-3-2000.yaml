    <p>ISO/IEC 11581 applies to icons that are shown on a screen, that users can manipulate and interact with, and that</p>
    <p>represent data or computer system functions. This part of ISO/IEC 11581 addresses only pointer icons. Pointers</p>
    <p>are icons that are logically attached to a physical input device, and that the user manipulates to interact with other</p>
    <p>screen elements, see ISO/IEC 11581-1. This part describes user interaction with and appearance of pointer icons</p>
    <p>on the screen. It also specifies how pointer icons on a screen change appearance to give users feedback. Other</p>
    <p>types of icons are covered in other parts of the standard that are listed in the Foreword.</p>
