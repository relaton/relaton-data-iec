abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607:2022 establishes a standardized method to determine the key
    control characteristic\r\n\r\n\tcarrier concentration\r\n\r\nfor semiconducting
    two-dimensional materials by the\r\n\r\n\r\n\tfield effect transistor (FET) method.\r\n\r\nFor
    semiconducting two-dimensional materials, the carrier concentration is evaluated
    using a field effect transistor (FET) test by a measurement of the voltage shift
    obtained from transfer curve upon doping process. The FET test structure consists
    of three terminals of source, drain, and gate where voltage is applied to induce
    the transistor action. Transfer curves are obtained by measuring drain current
    while applying varied gate voltage and constant drain voltage with respect to
    the source which is grounded."
