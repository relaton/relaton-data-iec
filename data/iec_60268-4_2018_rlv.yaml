abstract:
- content: "IEC 60268-4:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60268-4:2018
    specifies methods of measurement for the electrical impedance, sensitivity, directional
    response pattern, dynamic range and external influences of sound system microphones,
    and also details the characteristics to be specified by the manufacturer. It applies
    to sound system microphones for all applications for speech and music. It does
    not apply to measurement microphones, but it does apply to each audio channel
    of microphones having more than one channel, for example for stereo or similar
    use. It is also applicable to flush-mounted microphones and to the analogue characteristics
    of microphones with digital audio output. For the purposes of this International
    Standard, a microphone includes all such devices as transformers, pre-amplifiers,
    or other elements that form an integral part of the microphone, up to the output
    terminals specified by the manufacturer. The major characteristics of a microphone
    are considered in Clauses 6 to 21. Additional characteristics are considered in
    Annex A and Annex C. IEC 60268-4:2018 cancels and replaces the fifth edition published
    in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) subclause 19.4 on \"pop\" measurement replaces Annex C;<br />\r\nb) new
    Annex D for noise measurements in the digital domain."
