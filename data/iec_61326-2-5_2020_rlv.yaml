abstract:
- content: "IEC 61326-2-5:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61326-2-5:2020
    treats the particular features for EMC testing of field devices with field bus
    interfaces. This part of IEC 61326 covers only the field bus interface of the
    equipment. This part refers only to field devices intended for use in process
    control and process measuring. In this document, field devices with interfaces
    according to IEC 61784-1:2019, CP 3/2 and CP 1/1 as defined in IEC 61784 are covered.
    Other field bus interfaces may be included in future editions of this document."
