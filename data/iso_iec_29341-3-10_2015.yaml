abstract:
- content: "<p>This service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0<em>.</em></p><p>This service type enables control over the transport
    of audio and video streams. The service type defines a?common' model for A/V transport
    control suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide
    variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players,
    VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to
    control tuners.</p><p>The service type is related to the ConnectionManager service
    type, which describes A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory
    service, which offers meta-information about the resource stored on the media.
    AVTransport also offers an action to retrieve any meta data embedded in the resource
    itself.</p><p>This service type does not offer<em>scheduled</em> recording.</p>"
