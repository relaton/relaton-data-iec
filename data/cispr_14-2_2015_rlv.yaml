abstract:
- content: "CISPR 14-2:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nCISPR 14-2:2015 deals
    with the electromagnetic immunity of appliances and similar apparatus for household
    and similar purposes that use electricity, as well as electric toys and electric
    tools, the rated voltage of the apparatus being not more than 250 V for single-phase
    apparatus to be connected to phase and neutral, and 480 V for other apparatus.
    Apparatus may incorporate motors, heating elements or their combination, may contain
    electric or electronic circuitry, and may be powered by the mains, by transformer,
    by batteries, or by any other electrical power source. Apparatus not intended
    for household use, but which nevertheless may require the immunity level, such
    as apparatus intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on
    farms, are within the scope of this standard, as far as they are included in CISPR
    14-1. In addition, the following are also included in the scope of this standard:<br
    />\r\n- microwave ovens for domestic use and catering;<br />\r\n- cooking hobs
    and cooking ovens, heated by means of r.f. energy;<br />\r\n- (single- and multiple-zone)
    induction cooking appliances;<br />\r\n- appliances for personal care equipped
    with radiators in the range from UV to IR, inclusive (this includes visible light);<br
    />\r\n- power supplies and battery chargers provided with or intended for apparatus
    within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 1997, Amendment 1:2001 and Amendment 2:2008. It
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- 5.1: For ESD
    tests on contacts of plugs and sockets the note (\"The 4 kV contact discharge
    shall be applied to conductive accessible parts. Metallic contacts, such as in
    battery compartments or in socket outlets, are excluded from this requirement.\")
    saying that no test on contacts is necessary has been removed. The IEC 61000-4-2
    includes a detailed description how to deal with ESD on contacts and other surfaces.
    Also discharge on HCP and VCP is required by the basic standard IEC 61000-4-2.<br
    />\r\n- 5.3 and 5.4: The tables for tests at D.C. power ports according IEC 61000-4-6
    are aligned with the generic standards and are the same for 5.3 and 5.4.<br />\r\n-
    5.3 and 5.4: For EUT with single mains cable and not other cable, the test set-up
    as shown in Figure 2 shall be used. The set-up as described in Annex F of IEC
    61000-4-6:2013 shall not be used.<br />\r\n- 5.5: The IEC 61000-4-22 has been
    introduced as alternative method for testing radiated immunity.<br />\r\n- 5.6:
    No line-to-earth surges are applied to products which do not have provision for
    connection to earth."
