  content: IEC TS 62607-7-2:2023 specifies the efficiency testing of photovoltaic
    cells (excluding multi-junction cells) under indoor light. Although it is primarily
    intended for nano-enabled photovoltaic cells (organic thin-film, dye-sensitized
    solar cells (DSC), and Perovskite solar cells), it can also be applied to other
    types of photovoltaic cells, such as Si, CIGS, GaAs cells, and so on.
