    <p>ISO/IEC TR 29136-3:2009 provides guidance on the mapping of the set of user needs with the provisions of a particular standard, technical report, or set of guidelines. It provides both basic guidance that should be used for all user needs mapping and optional guidance that may be added to the basic guidance.</p>
    <p>User needs mapping is a voluntary activity intended to help improve accessibility for all users and in particular for users with special needs that might otherwise be overlooked. User needs mapping is not intended to be used to evaluate, certify, or otherwise judge a given standard or set of guidelines.</p>
