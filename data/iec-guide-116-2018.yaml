  content: "IEC Guide 116:2018(E) is non-mandatory and complements ISO/IEC Guide 51
    and establishes guidelines useful for achieving safety in low voltage equipment.
    These guidelines include risk assessment, in which the knowledge and experience
    of the design, use, incidents, accidents and harm related to low voltage equipment
    are brought together in order to assess the risks during the relevant phases of
    the life of the equipment and to implement the basics for risk reduction measures.
    This IEC guide should be used by technical committees as far as appropriate and
    to the extent they decide to apply it. It gives additional guidance to ISO/IEC
    Guides 50, 51 and 71 on the information required to allow risk assessment to be
    carried out performed.<br />\r\nThis second edition of IEC Guide 116 cancels and
    replaces its first edition published in 2010 and constitutes a technical revision;
    main changes with respect to the first edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- addition
    of a clause dealing with safety related security aspects, derived from the IEC
    62443 series;<br />\r\n- reference to “domestic animals” rather than to “livestock”;<br
    />\r\n- alignment of definitions and Figure 2 with the latest edition of ISO/IEC
    Guide 51 (2014);"
