  content: "IEC TS 63165:2024 applies to the industrial water quality analyzer system
    that uses a photometric method to determine the concentration of one or more chemical
    components in industrial water (water used in manufacturing, processing, cooling,
    washing, boiler, etc).<br />\r\nThe objective of this document is to:<br />\r\n-
    specify the terminology and definitions related to the performance characteristics
    of a photometric industrial water quality analyzer system;<br />\r\n- unify the
    performance expression and verifying methods of such an analyzer system;<br />\r\n-
    specify the test procedures to be used in making statements on the performance
    characteristics of a photometric industrial water quality analyzer system."
