abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 61340-5-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC TR 61340-5-2:2018,
    which has been developed to support IEC 61340-5-1, applies to activities that:
    manufacture, process, assemble, install, package, label, service, test, inspect,
    transport or otherwise handle electrical or electronic parts, assemblies and equipment
    with withstand voltages greater than or equal to 100 V HBM, 200 V CDM and 35 V
    for isolated conductors. Additional control elements or adjusted limits can be
    applicable for ESDS with lower withstand voltages. This second edition of IEC
    TR 61340-5-2 has been modified to provide guidance for users of IEC 61340-5-1:2016.
    The text has been arranged to follow the requirements of IEC 61340‑5‑1:2016 as
    closely as possible as well as providing specific guidance on each of the requirements
    of IEC 61340-5-1:2016.</p>'
