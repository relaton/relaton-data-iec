  content: It presents both DC and AC active filters, including the existing installations.
    The items of the report are basically arranged in two consecutive parts, the first
    one treating the DC application, and the second covering the AC filters. As active
    DC and AC filters share many concepts, the reader interested in such a subject
    is encouraged to search for it in both parts.
