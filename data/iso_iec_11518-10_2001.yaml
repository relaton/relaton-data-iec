abstract:
- content: "Specifies a physical-level, point-to-point, full-duplex, link interface\nfor
    reliable, flow-controlled transmission of user data at 6 400 Mbit/s per direction,
    across\ndistances of up to 1 km. \n\nCharacteristics of a HIPPI-6400-PH physical-layer
    interface include:\n\n- user data transfer bandwidth of 6 400 Mbit/s (800 MByte/s);\n\n-
    a full-duplex link capable of independent full-bandwidth transfers in both directions\nsimultaneously;\n\n-
    four virtual circuits providing a limited multiplexing capability;\n\n- a fixed-size
    transfer unit, i.e., a 32-byte micropacket, for hardware efficiency;\n\n- a small
    transfer unit resulting in low latency for short Messages, and a component for\nlarge
    transfers;\n\n- credit-based flow control that prevents buffer overflow;\n\n-
    end-to-end, as well as link-to-link, checksums;\n\n- automatic retransmission
    to correct flawed data providing guaranteed, in-order, reliable,\ndata delivery;\n\n-
    an a.c. coupled parallel electrical interface for driving parallel copper cable
    over limited\ndistances;\n\n-  a parallel electrical interface for driving a local
    optical interface for longer distances."
