    <p>ISO/IEC 24793 specifies mobile multicast communications (MMC), which can be used to support a variety of multimedia multicasting services in IP-based wireless mobile networks as well as wired fixed networks. MMC targets real-time, one-to-many multicast services and applications over mobile communications networks. This implies that MMC focuses on multicast services rather than broadcast services, and that only authenticated users could be allowed in the multicast session. MMC also considers the one-to-many multicast session wherein a single multicast sender is allowed in the session rather than many-to-many multicast services. In addition, MMC is targeted in the real-time multicast session rather than the reliable multicast session; the timely delivery of multicast data is considered a key factor.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24793-1:2010 specifies the MMC framework as part of the MMC standard describing the framework and functional architecture of MMC. Based on this framework, the two protocols for MMC will be developed in two parts of the MMC project: protocol over native IP multicast networks and protocol over overlay multicast networks.</p>
