abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61836:2016(E) deals with the terms, definitions and symbols from
    national and international solar photovoltaic standards and relevant documents
    used within the field of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems. It includes the
    terms, definitions and symbols compiled from the published IEC technical committee
    82 standards. The main technical change with regard to the previous edition consists
    of adding / revising terms and definitions which have been discussed and agreed
    on during recent meetings of the TC 82 terminology working group.
