  content: IEC 62386-302:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies a bus system for control by
    digital signals of electronic lighting equipment which is in line with the requirements
    of IEC 61347, with the addition of DC supplies. This document is only applicable
    to IEC 62386-103:2014 and IEC 62386­-103:2014/AMD1:— input devices that make the
    lighting control system sensitive to absolute input devices such as switches or
    sliders. An absolute input device always has a deterministic state, such as a
    position between start and end point.
