abstract:
- content: IEC 61375-2-8:2021 applies to all equipment and devices implemented according
    to IEC 61375-2-3:2015, IEC 61375-2-5:2014 and IEC 61375-3-4:2014, i.e. it covers
    the procedures to be applied to such equipment and devices when the conformance
    should be proven. The applicability of this document to a TCN implementation allows
    for individual conformance checking of the implementation itself, and is a pre-requisite
    for further interoperability checking between different TCN implementations.
