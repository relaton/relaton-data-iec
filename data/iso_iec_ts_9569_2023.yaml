abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document specifies patch management (PAM) security assurance requirements
    and is intended to be used as an extension of the ISO/IEC 15408 series and ISO/IEC
    18045.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">The security assurance requirements specified in this document do not include
    evaluation or test activities on the final target of evaluation (TOE), but focus
    on the initial TOE and on the life cycle processes used by manufacturers. Additionally,
    this document gives guidance to facilitate the evaluation of the TOE, including
    the patch and development processes which support the patch management.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This
    document lists options for evaluation authorities (or mutual recognition agreements)
    on how to utilize the additional assurance and additional evidence in their processes
    to enable the developer to consistently re-certify their updated or patched TOEs
    to the benefit of the users. The implementation of these options using an evaluation
    scheme is out of the scope of this document.</p>'
