  content: "IEC 62056-5-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62056-5-3:2016 specifies
    the DLMS/COSEM application layer in terms of structure, services and protocols
    for COSEM clients and servers, and defines how to use the DLMS/COSEM application
    layer in various communication profiles. It defines services for establishing
    and releasing application associations, and data communication services for accessing
    the methods and attributes of COSEM interface objects, defined in IEC 62056-6-2:2016,
    using either logical name (LN) or short name (SN) referencing. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 62056-5-3 published in 2013."
