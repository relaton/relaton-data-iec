  content: "IEC 60092-501:2025 applies to electric propulsion plants and specifies
    system design, installation and testing for equipment such as:<br />\r\n- generators
    and their prime movers or other power sources (fuel cell, battery, …);<br />\r\n-
    switchboards;<br />\r\n-transformers/reactors;<br />\r\n- semiconductor converters;<br
    />\r\n- propulsion motors;<br />\r\n- excitation systems;<br />\r\n- control,
    monitoring and safety systems;<br />\r\n- wires, cables, busbars or trunking systems;<br
    />\r\n- podded drives including azimuth.<br />\r\nThrusters intended either as
    auxiliary steering or auxiliary propulsion devices or both and booster equipment
    are excluded.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition
    published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of podded drives including azimuth in the
    scope;<br />\r\nb) addition of alternative power sources;<br />\r\nc) modification
    of the special requirements for ships with only one propulsion motor;<br />\r\nd)
    new definition for test of slip ring units;<br />\r\ne) modification of Figure
    2 and description;<br />\r\nf) addition of a description of power management functions;<br
    />\r\ng) addition of emergency stop at control stations;<br />\r\nh) clearer start
    blockings;<br />\r\ni) deletion of Table A.2, Table A.3 and Table A.4 in Annex
    A. Their content has been moved to Table 1."
