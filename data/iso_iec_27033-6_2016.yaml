abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 27033-6:2016 describes the threats, security requirements, security
    control and design techniques associated with wireless networks. It provides guidelines
    for the selection, implementation and monitoring of the technical controls necessary
    to provide secure communications using wireless networks. The information in this
    part of ISO/IEC 27033 is intended to be used when reviewing or selecting technical
    security architecture/design options that involve the use of wireless network
    in accordance with ISO/IEC 27033‑2.<p>Overall, ISO/IEC 27033‑6 will aid considerably
    the comprehensive definition and implementation of security for any organization's
    wireless network environment. It is aimed at users and implementers who are responsible
    for the implementation and maintenance of the technical controls necessary to
    provide secure wireless networks.</p>
