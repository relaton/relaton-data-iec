  content: "IEC 61156-8:2023 relates to IEC 61156-1 and IEC 61156-7. The cables described
    herein are specified up to 1 200 MHz and are specifically designed to build work
    area cords. It covers a cable having four individually screened (S/FTP) pairs.
    The cable can be provided with a common screen over the cable core. The cables
    covered by this sectional specification are intended to operate with voltages
    and currents normally encountered in communication systems and support the delivery
    of DC low voltage remote powering applications. These cables are not intended
    to be used in conjunction with low impedance sources, for example the electric
    power supply of public utility mains. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2009, and Amendment 1:2013. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. align clauses with IEC 61156-1:2023;<br />\r\nb. additional reference
    to IEC 62153-4-9 test method (triaxial) for coupling attenuation measurement to
    be consistent with all other parts of the IEC 61156 series;<br />\r\nc. incorporation
    of blank detail specification."
