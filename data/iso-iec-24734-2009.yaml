    <p>ISO/IEC 24734:2009 provides a method for measuring the productivity of digital printing devices with various office applications and print job characteristics. </p>
    <p>It is applicable to digital printing devices, including single function printing and multi-function devices, regardless of print technology (e.g. inkjet, laser). Devices can be equipped with a range of paper feed and finishing options either directly connected to the computer system or via a network. </p>
    <p>It is intended to be used for black and white (B&amp;W) as well as colour digital printing devices. </p>
    <p>It allows for the comparison of the productivity of machines operating in various available modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, etc.) and office applications when the test system environment, operating modes, and job mix for each machine are held identical. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24734:2009 includes test files, test setup procedure, test runtime procedure, and the reporting requirements for the digital printing productivity measurements. It is not intended to be used for devices which are not able to print on a media size of A4/8.5”x11” or for devices which are not able to collate multiple copies of a print.</p>
