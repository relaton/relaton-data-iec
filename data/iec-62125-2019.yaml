  content: "IEC 62125:2019 provides methodologies addressing environmental evaluation
    and communication related to cables in normal use.<br />\r\nIt includes an environmental
    checklist for power cables, the method for life cycle assessment (LCA) and a methodology
    for conductor size optimization.<br />\r\nThe results obtained by applying such
    methodologies can be used for external communication. Environmental communication
    can also include other topics, such as material declaration."
