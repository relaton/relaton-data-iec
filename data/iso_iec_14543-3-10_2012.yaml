abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14543-3-10:2012(E) specifies a wireless protocol for low-powered
    devices such as energy harvested devices in a home environment. This wireless
    protocol is specifically designed to keep the energy consumption of such sensors
    and switches extremely low. The WSP protocol system consists of two and optionally
    three types of components that are specified in this standard. These are the transmitter,
    the receiver and optionally the repeater. Repeaters are needed when the transmitter
    and the receiver are located in such a way that no good direct communication between
    them can be established.
