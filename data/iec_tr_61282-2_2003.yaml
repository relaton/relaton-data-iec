abstract:
- content: Describes a model developed as a tool to assist the physical layer committee
    of the gigabit ethernet (IEEE 802.3z)standard to understand potential trade-offs
    between various link penalties associated with laser-based backbone links. This
    technical report documents the model as used by gigabit ethernet and identifies
    how it was used to develop the standard specifications. This technical report
    presents the theoretical model. Experimental verification is also presented for
    links operating at valid gigabit ethernet wavelengths of 780 nm, 850 nm and 1
    300 nm.
