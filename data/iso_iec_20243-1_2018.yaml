abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20243-1:2018 (O-TTPS) is a set of guidelines, requirements, and recommendations
    that address specific threats to the integrity of hardware and software COTS ICT
    products throughout the product life cycle. This release of the Standard addresses
    threats related to maliciously tainted and counterfeit products.<br />\r\nThe
    provider's product life cycle includes the work it does designing and developing
    products, as well as the supply chain aspects of that life cycle, collectively
    extending through the following phases: design, sourcing, build, fulfillment,
    distribution, sustainment, and disposal. While this Standard cannot fully address
    threats that originate wholly outside any span of control of the provider? for
    example, a counterfeiter producing a fake printed circuit board assembly that
    has no original linkage to the Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM)? the practices
    detailed in the Standard will provide some level of mitigation. An example of
    such a practice would be the use of security labeling techniques in legitimate
    products.<p>The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.</p>"
