abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24779-9:2015 specifies the symbols and icons to be used in
    conjunction with vascular image recognition.</p><p>It specifies a family of symbols
    and icons used in association with devices for biometric enrolment, verification,
    and/or identification. Icons are for display on visual display screens. Symbols
    are printed on signs and printed documents including user documents, hand outs,
    training material, installation/maintenance manuals, and on case or key tops and
    buttons of devices.</p><p>The symbols and icons are intended to show the modality
    of biometrics and to advise the necessity of appropriate preparation and the behaviour
    required in order to use the biometric systems. T ISO/IEC 24779-9:2015 focuses
    on communication with the data capture subject. Operators could use ISO/IEC 24779-9:2015
    but they might need additional symbols and information.</p>"
