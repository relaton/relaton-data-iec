  content: "IEC 60904-4:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60904-4:2019
    sets the requirements for calibration procedures intended to establish the traceability
    of photovoltaic (PV) reference devices to SI units as required by IEC 60904-2.
    This document applies to PV reference devices that are used to measure the irradiance
    of natural or simulated sunlight for the purpose of quantifying the performance
    of PV devices. The use of a PV reference device is required in many standards
    concerning PV (e.g. IEC 60904-1 and IEC 60904-3). This document has been written
    with single-junction PV reference devices in mind, in particular crystalline silicon,
    but it is sufficiently general to include other single-junction technologies.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\nmodification of standard title;<br />\r\n- inclusion
    of working reference in traceability chain;<br />\r\n- update of WRR with respect
    to SI;<br />\r\n- revision of all methods and their uncertainties in annex<br
    />\r\n- harmonization of symbols and formulae with other IEC standards.<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of September 2020 have been included in this copy."
