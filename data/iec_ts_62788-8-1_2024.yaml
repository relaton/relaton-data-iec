abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62788-8-1:2024 defines test methods and datasheet reporting requirements
    for key characteristics of ECA used in photovoltaic modules, involving mechanical
    characteristics, adhesive characteristics, electrical characteristics, thermal
    characteristics, etc.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is to offer a standard
    test procedure to ECA manufacturers for product design, production and quality
    control, and to PV module manufacturers for the purpose of material screening,
    material inspection, process control, and failure analysis.<br />\r\nThis document
    is intended to be applied to ECA used in solar PV modules. For non-conductive
    adhesives or tapes used in PV modules, the applicable test methods except for
    electrical characteristics in this document may be used."
