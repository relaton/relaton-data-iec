abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000-7:2008 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating as an active RF tag in the 433 MHz band used in item
    management applications. The purpose of ISO/IEC 18000-7:2008 is to provide a common
    technical specification for RFID devices that may be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2008 is intended to allow for compatibility
    and to encourage interoperability of products for the growing RFID market in the
    international marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for
    technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating
    channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power, spurious emissions,
    modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission
    order and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence,
    spreading sequence and chip rate. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2008 further defines the communications
    protocol used in the air interface.
