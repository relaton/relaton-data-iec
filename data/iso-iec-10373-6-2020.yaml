    <p>The ISO/IEC 10373 series defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1    Criteria for acceptability do not form part of the ISO/IEC 10373 series, but can be found in the International Standards mentioned above.</p>
    <p>This document defines test methods which are specific to proximity cards and objects, proximity coupling devices and proximity extended devices, defined in ISO/IEC 14443‑1, ISO/IEC 14443‑2, ISO/IEC 14443‑3 and ISO/IEC 14443‑4.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2    Test methods defined in this document are intended to be performed separately. A given proximity card or object, proximity coupling device or proximity extended device, is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10373‑1 defines test methods which are common to one or more integrated circuit card technologies and other parts in the ISO/IEC 10373 series deal with other technology‑specific tests.</p>
    <p>The conformance test plan defined in Annex O specifies the list of tests applicable for each part of the ISO/IEC 14443 series.</p>
