  content: "IEC 62541-11:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62541-11:
    2025 defines the Information Model associated with Historical Access (HA). It
    particularly includes additional and complementary descriptions of the NodeClasses
    and Attributes needed for Historical Access, additional standard Properties, and
    other information and behaviour. The complete AddressSpace Model including all
    NodeClasses and Attributes is specified in IEC 62541‑3. The predefined Information
    Model is defined in IEC 62541‑5. The Services to detect and access historical
    data and events, and description of the ExtensibleParameter types are specified
    in IEC 62541‑4. This document includes functionality to compute and return Aggregates
    like minimum, maximum, average etc. The Information Model and the concrete working
    of Aggregates are defined in IEC 62541‑13. Conventions for Historical Access Clients
    are informatively provided in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) a functionality has been added
    to support retrieving of modified events;<br />\r\nb) an Event has been added
    to indicate when a backfill occurred;<br />\r\nc) a new ReferenceType that can
    be used to indicate an external node has been defined;<br />\r\nd) the text has
    been improved to better explain the concept of annotation and remove conflicting
    explanations;<br />\r\ne) a default historian configuration (and where to find
    it) has been defined;<br />\r\nf) HistoricalEventConfigurationType, which provides
    general configuration information about the historical Event storage, has been
    added;<br />\r\ng) the text has been updated and optional fields have been added
    to HA configuration object to allow configuration to be defined for periodic data
    collection, not just for exception-based collection;<br />\r\nh) an ObjectType
    that can be used for external event collection has been provided as well as an
    example how historians can be configured."
