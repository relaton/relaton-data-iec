  content: "IEC 60079-10-2:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-10-2:2015 is
    concerned with the identification and classification of areas where explosive
    dust atmospheres and combustible dust layers are present, in order to permit the
    proper assessment of ignition sources in such areas. In this standard, explosive
    dust atmospheres and combustible dust layers are treated separately. In Clause
    4, area classification for explosive dusts clouds is described, with dust layers
    acting as one of the possible sources of release. In Clause 7 other general considerations
    for dust layers are described. The examples in this standard are based on a system
    of effective housekeeping being implemented in the plant to prevent dust layers
    from accumulating. Where effective housekeeping is not present, the area classification
    includes the possible formation of explosive dust clouds from dust layers. The
    principles of this standard can also be followed when combustible fibres or flyings
    might cause a hazard. This standard is intended to be applied where there can
    be a risk due to the presence of explosive dust atmospheres or combustible dust
    layers under normal atmospheric conditions. Please refer to the foreword of the
    document for a detailed listing of the significant technical changes from the
    previous edition.<br />\r\nKeywords: explosive dust atmospheres, combustible dust
    layers, ignition hazard"
