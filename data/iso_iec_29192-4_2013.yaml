    ISO/IEC 29192-4:2013 specifies three lightweight mechanisms using asymmetric techniques:
    a) a unilateral authentication mechanism based on discrete logarithms on elliptic curves;
    b) an authenticated lightweight key exchange (ALIKE) mechanism for unilateral authentication and establishment of a session key;
    c) an identity-based signature mechanism.
