abstract:
- content: The construction of high-performance systems with parallel communications,
    parallel processing, and/or parallel I/O demands a fast, low-cost, low-latency
    interconnect. It must be fast and low-latency, otherwise it will be the limiting
    factor in system performance; and it must be low-cost, or it will dominate the
    system cost. This standard has been developed to complement recent technical developments
    of highly integrated, low-power interconnect technology implemented in high-volume
    commodity VLSI processes, and to exploit the simplifications in encodings and
    protocols resulting from the use of relatively reliable media over relatively
    short distances.
