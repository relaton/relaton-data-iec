  content: "IEC TS 62565-1:2023 which is a Technical Specification, defines the system
    of blank detail specifications for nanomaterials and nano-assemblies as well as
    final nano-enabled products addressed in the nanomanufacturing value chain.<br
    />\r\nIt defines the concepts of blank detail specification (BDS), detail specification
    (DS) and key control characteristic (KCC). Furthermore, it provides guidelines
    how to develop and use product specifications, particularly the IEC 62565 series,
    in the field of nanotechnology.<br />\r\nThis document also provides guidelines
    regarding the certification and reliability aspects for products specified by
    a DS and associated KCCs.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The IEC 62565 series uses an open generic
    structure that can be flexibly adapted to technical developments. The double indexing
    of the individual parts allows grouping into technology areas without restriction
    due to an overly strict hierarchical structure.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Key elements of
    the IEC 62565 series are a consensus-based set of key control characteristics
    (KCCs) with clear definitions and standardized measurement procedures to measure
    them."
