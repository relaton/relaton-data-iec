  content: "IEC 62148-21:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62148-21: 2021 covers
    the design guidelines of the electrical interface for photonic integrated circuit
    (PIC) packages using silicon fine-pitch ball grid array (S-FBGA) and silicon fine-pitch
    land grid array (S-FLGA). In this document, the electrical interface for the S-FBGA
    package is informative. The purpose of this document is to specify adequately
    the electrical interface of PIC packages composed of optical transmitters and
    receivers that enable mechanical and electrical interchangeability of PIC packages.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical change with respect to the previous edition: specification
    of an electric guard band area around the optical terminal area, so as to allow
    applications with electric signals at higher symbol rates (e.g. 50 Gbaud and 100
    Gbaud).</p>"
