  content: IEC 63504-2804:2023 defines an architecture description standard from the
    software design perspective - this provides a common interface that abstracts
    the hardware properties that are critical to enable multicore tools. The standard
    includes performance estimation accuracy for complex processors like Very Long
    Instruction Word (VLIW) core and complex contention scenarios, description of
    caches to include uncached memory regions and caches for subsets of memories,
    properties for coarse power consumption estimation, and reusability by separating
    eXtensible Markup Language (XML) files for processor description and other memory/communication-related
    information. This is an IEC/IEEE dual logo standard.
