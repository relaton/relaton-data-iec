abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 62257-10:2017(E) is designed to be used as a guide to visually
    inspect front-contact poly-crystalline and mono-crystalline silicon solar photovoltaic
    (PV) modules for major defects. The modules under consideration may be of any
    size or rated power, however some specific use-cases for solar modules may have
    different requirements and therefore adaption of this document is application
    and institution dependent (ex. labelling may not be present for a solar module
    sold as part of a small off-grid lighting kit). This document is meant to supplement
    and support rather than replace international testing standards such as IEC 61215.
