    <p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a 300 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) of Type WORM (Write</p>
    <p>Once Read Many) using irreversible effects, with a capacity of 30 Gbytes. This WORM ODC's uses writing effects that are</p>
    <p>inherently irreversible. Written marks cannot be erased and attempted modifications of the written marks are detectable.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>− the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</p>
    <p>− the environments in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</p>
    <p>− the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge, so as to provide mechanical interchange ability</p>
    <p>between data processing systems;</p>
    <p>− the format of the information on the disk, both pre-written and user-written, including the physical disposition of the tracks</p>
    <p>and sectors, the error correction codes, the modulation methods used;</p>
    <p>− the characteristics of the prerecorded information on the disk;</p>
    <p>− the recording characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write data onto the disk;</p>
    <p>− the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file</p>
    <p>structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
