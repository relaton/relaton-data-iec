abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 20000-12:2016 provides guidance on the relationship between
    ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and CMMI-SVC V1.3 (through Maturity Level 3). Service providers
    can refer to this guidance as a cross-reference between the two documents to help
    them to plan and implement an SMS. An organization employing the practices in
    the indicated CMMI-SVC process areas can conform to many of the associated ISO/IEC
    20000‑1 requirements.<p>The guidance in Clause 4 describes how CMMI-SVC can support
    the demonstration of conformity to ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011. A description of the
    purpose and content of both publications in 4.1 and 4.2 is followed by Clause
    5, which relates process areas in CMMI-SVC to clauses in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011.
    The tables in Annexes A and B relate terms, clauses, and paragraphs in ISO/IEC
    20000‑1:2011 to CMMI-SVC. Table B.1 is a simplified summary of the correlation
    seen in Table 3 for those readers who want an overview. The tables indicate those
    aspects of ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and CMMI-SVC that represent the greatest link
    between the two sets of documents, from the perspective of a service provider.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 20000-12:2016 can be used by any organization or person who wishes to understand
    how CMMI-SVC can be used with ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011, including the following:</p><p>a)
    a service provider that intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and is seeking guidance on the use of CMMI-SVC to establish
    and maintain the SMS and the services;</p><p>b) a service provider that has demonstrated
    conformity to the requirements of ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011 and is seeking guidance
    on ways to use CMMI-SVC to improve the SMS and the services;</p><p>c) a service
    provider that already uses CMMI-SVC and is seeking guidance on how CMMI-SVC can
    be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011;</p><p>d) an appraiser or assessor who wishes to understand
    the use of CMMI-SVC as support for the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000‑1:2011.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 20000-12:2016 can also be used with the other parts of the ISO/IEC 20000 series.</p>
