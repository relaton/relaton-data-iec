abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61000 is a technical report that provides background material
    describing the motivation for developing IEC standards on the effects of high
    power electromagnetic (HPEM) fields, currents and voltages on civil systems. In
    the light of newly emerging transient antenna technology and the increasing use
    of digital electronics, the possibility of equipment being upset or damaged by
    these environments is of concern. This document begins with a general introduction
    to this subject and a listing of the pertinent definitions used. Following these
    clauses, the HPEM environments that are of concern are described and a discussion
    of the various effects that these environments can induce in civil systems is
    presented. Finally, techniques used to protect systems against these environments
    are summarised. More detailed information will be provided in separate documents
    in this 61000 series.
