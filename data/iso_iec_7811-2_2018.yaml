abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 7811-2:2018 defines the characteristics for identification cards
    as defined in Clause 4 of this document and the use of such cards for international
    interchange.<br />\r\nThis document specifies requirements for a low coercivity
    magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on an identification card,
    the encoding technique and coded character sets. It takes into consideration both
    human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.<br />\r\nCoercivity
    influences many of the quantities specified in this document but is not itself
    specified.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 7811 provides criteria to which cards are to perform.
    No consideration is given within ISO/IEC 7811 to the amount of use, if any, experienced
    by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria is negotiated
    between the involved parties.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 10373-2 specifies the test procedures
    used to check cards against the parameters specified in this document.<br />\r\nNOTE
    Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial measurement system in this document may
    have been rounded off and are consistent with, but not exactly equal to each other.
    Using either system is correct but intermixing or reconverting values can result
    in errors. The original design was made using the Imperial measurement system."
