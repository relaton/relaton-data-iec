abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7811 defines the characteristics for identification cards as
    defined in Clause 4 of this document and the use of such cards for international
    interchange.</p><p>This document specifies requirements for a low coercivity magnetic
    stripe (including any protective overlay) on an identification card, the encoding
    technique and coded character sets. It takes into consideration both human and
    machine aspects and states minimum requirements.</p><p>Coercivity influences many
    of the quantities specified in this document but is not itself specified.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    7811 provides criteria to which cards are to perform. No consideration is given
    within ISO/IEC 7811 to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the card prior
    to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria is negotiated between the involved
    parties.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10373-2 specifies the test procedures used to check cards
    against the parameters specified in this document.</p><p>NOTE Numeric values in
    the SI and/or Imperial measurement system in this document may have been rounded
    off and are consistent with, but not exactly equal to each other. Using either
    system is correct but intermixing or reconverting values can result in errors.
    The original design was made using the Imperial measurement system.</p>"
