  content: IEC TR 63222-101:2025 aims to provide guidelines for power quality data
    applications on different aspects in public power supply systems at voltage ranges
    from LV, MV and HV with 50 Hz or 60 Hz rated frequency. It intends to provide
    a methodology for mining hidden knowledge and support power quality management
    based on PQ data analytics. Its primary goal is to serve different aspects of
    power system to promote the system maintaining its normal state and improve efficiency.
    It can also help avoid unexpected system events, equipment malfunction/maloperation,
    and production process interruption. The various methodologies and methods mentioned
    in this document are optional.
