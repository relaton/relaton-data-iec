abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-100:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC TS 62600-100:2024 applied
    in conjunction with the IEC Technical Specification on wave energy resource assessment
    and characterization (IEC TS 62600-101), provides a method for estimation of the
    mean annual energy production of a WEC, assessing the electrical power production
    performance of a single, non-array, wave energy converter, at Location 2 based
    on the performance at Location 1.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document includes:<br
    />\r\na) All wave energy converters that produce electrical power from wave energy.<br
    />\r\nb) All sea resource zones (near and offshore, deep and shallow water).<br
    />\r\nc) Capture width matrix transposition from one location to another.<br />\r\nd)
    Limitation on the changes that are allowed to the WEC and the specification of
    the location.<br />\r\ne) Wave data required at Location 2, as a minimum the requirements
    found in IEC TS 62600â€‘101.<br />\r\nf) Development of the capture width matrix
    at Location 2.<br />\r\ng) Validation of the capture width matrix at Location
    2.<br />\r\nh) Assessment of uncertainties in the derived performance parameters
    at Location 2.<br />\r\ni) Requirements for the allowable power performance transfer
    by geometric, kinematic and dynamic similarity.<br />\r\nj) Requirements for the
    allowable incorporation of additional empirical model data.<br />\r\nk) Requirements
    for the allowable incorporation of additional numerical model data.<br />\r\nl)
    The document applies to commercial scale wave energy converters that are:<br />\r\n-
    compliantly moored.<br />\r\n- tautly moored.<br />\r\n- bottom mounted.<br />\r\n-
    shore mounted.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2012. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Incorporation of IEC TS 62600-102
    as a series of annexes in this document.<br />\r\nb) Removal of the computation
    of annual energy production. This has been moved to IEC TS 62600-101.<br />\r\nc)
    Modification to the list of terms definitions, symbols and units.<br />\r\nd)
    Modification of the reporting section to align with IEC TS 62600-200.</p>"
