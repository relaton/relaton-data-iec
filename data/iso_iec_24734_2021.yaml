abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for measuring the digital printing
    productivity of digital printing devices with various office applications and
    print job characteristics. This document is applicable to digital printing devices,
    including single-function and multi-function devices, regardless of print technology
    (e.g. inkjet, laser). Devices can be equipped with a range of paper feed and finishing
    options either directly connected to the computer system or via a network. It
    is intended to be used for black and white (B&amp;W) as well as colour digital
    printing devices. It allows for the comparison of the productivity of machines
    operating in various available modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, etc.)
    and office applications when the test system environment, operating modes, and
    job mix for each machine are held identical. This document includes test files,
    test setup procedure, test runtime procedure, and the reporting requirements for
    the digital printing productivity measurements.</p><p>This document is not intended
    to be used for devices which are not able to print on a media size of A4/8,5”
    × 11” or for devices which are not able to collate multiple copies of a print.</p><p>This
    document is not intended to replace manufacturer's rated speeds.</p>"
