  content: "IEC 60598-2-4:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60598-2-4:2017
    specifies requirements for portable general purpose luminaires for indoor and/or
    outdoor use (e.g. garden use), other than handlamps, designed to be used with
    or incorporating electrical light sources on supply voltages not exceeding 250
    V.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- alignment with IEC 60598-1;<br />\r\n- modification of the
    scope, classification and requirements to cover portable luminaires for both indoor
    and outdoor applications, by introducing the requirements already listed in IEC
    60598-2-7;<br />\r\nNOTE  In this edition of IEC 60598-2-4 all requirements listed
    in IEC 60598-2-7 have been incorporated. As a consequence, IEC 60598-2-7 will
    be withdrawn after publication of this standard.<br />\r\n- modification of the
    scope to cover all electrical light sources (it was previously limited to tungsten
    filament, tubular fluorescent and other discharge lamps);<br />\r\n- introduction
    of the symbol for luminaires which are other than ordinary, but suitable for indoor
    applications only (e.g. luminaire using PVC cable);<br />\r\n- modification in
    the detail of test to clarify that the stability test on an inclined plane (see
    4.7.3) shall be carried out with the light source(s) in place;<br />\r\n- modification
    of the minimum degree of protection against dust and moisture for portable luminaires
    for outdoor use from IPX3 to IPX4 (see 4.5.2); as a consequence, the requirements
    for cable entry position, as given in IEC 60598-2-7:1982, 7.6.3 were deleted as
    they are covered by IPX4;<br />\r\n- modification of the requirements for the
    acceptance criteria of plug and socket outlet;<br />\r\n- modification of the
    IP test requiring the most unfavourable of the overturned positions to cover all
    classes (and not only class II luminaires as in 7.13.1 of IEC 60598-2-7:1982)."
