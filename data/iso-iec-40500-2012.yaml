    <p>ISO/IEC 40500:2012 [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0] covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, limited movement, speech disabilities, photo-sensitivity and combinations of these. Following these guidelines will also often make your Web content more usable to users in general. </p>
    <p>WCAG 2.0 success criteria are written as testable statements that  are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents.</p>
    <p>An overview of WCAG 2.0, the WCAG 2.0 standard, technical and education material supporting implementation of WCAG 2.0, and information on translating WCAG 2.0, are freely available from <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag#iso">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview</a>.</p>
