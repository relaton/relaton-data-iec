  content: "IEC TR 62343-6-6:2017(E) which is a Technical Report, describes failure
    mode effect analysis (FMEA) for optical units of dynamic modules. FMEA is one
    of the effective and useful analysis methods to determine the reliability evaluation
    test items and conditions that are defined in future reliability qualification
    documents. In order to estimate the lifetime for a module, there is a typical
    procedure. The first step is to identify the dominant failure modes. The second
    step is to determine the acceleration tests according to these failure modes.
    The third step is to carry out the test. The fourth step is to estimate the acceleration
    factors. Finally, the fifth step is to calculate the lifetime of the dynamic module.
    IEC 61300-2 (all parts) defines environment and mechanical tests. This Technical
    Report describes the dominant failure mode for dynamic modules and relevant tests
    from IEC 61300­2 (all parts). This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2011. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- addition of the LCOS based and the DLP based wavelength selective switch
    (WSS);<br />\r\n- addition of the multicast optical switch module (MCOS)."
