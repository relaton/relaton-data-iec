abstract:
- content: "IEC 62153-4-3:2013(E) determines the screening effectiveness of a cable
    shield by applying a well-defined current and voltage to the screen of the cable
    and measuring the induced voltage in order to determine the surface transfer impedance.
    This test measures only the magnetic component of the transfer impedance. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2006. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    now three different test configurations are described;<br />\r\n- formulas to
    calculate the maximum frequency up to which the different test configurations
    can be used are included;<br />\r\n- the effect of ground loops is described."
