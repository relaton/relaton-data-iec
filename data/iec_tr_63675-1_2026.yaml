abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63675-1:2026 is a Technical Report. Millimetre wave and terahertz
    wave radio communication services require low phase noise oscillators in order
    to comply with radio regulations and reduce the computing resources required for
    demodulation processes. This document provides the principle and application of
    the optoelectronic oscillation technologies using the photonics technique as a
    guideline for the design of the radiocommunication transceivers.
