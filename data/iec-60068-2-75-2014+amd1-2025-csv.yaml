  content: "IEC 60068-2-75:2014+AMD1:2025 CSV provides three standardized and coordinated
    test methods for determining the ability of a specimen to withstand specified
    severities of impact. It is used, in particular, to demonstrate an acceptable
    level of robustness when assessing the safety of a product and is primarily intended
    for the testing of electrotechnical items. It consists of the application to the
    specimen of a prescribed number of impacts defined by their impact energy and
    applied in the prescribed directions. This part of IEC 60068 covers energy levels
    ranging from 0,14 J (joules) to 50 J (joules). This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition, published in 1997, and constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical change with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- reconsideration of some values in Tables 1
    and 2. Although some values are no longer recommended, they have been retained
    as alternatives for historical consistency purposes."
