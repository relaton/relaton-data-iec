  content: "IEC 61290-1-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61290-1-1:2020
    applies to all commercially available optical amplifiers (OAs) and optically amplified
    modules. It applies to OAs using optical fibre amplifiers (OFAs) based on either
    rare-earth doped fibres or on the Raman effect, semiconductor OAs (SOAs) and planar
    optical waveguide amplifiers (POWAs). The object of this document is to establish
    uniform requirements for accurate and reliable measurements, by means of the optical
    spectrum analyzer (OSA) test method, of the following OA parameters, as defined
    in IEC 61291-1:<br />\r\n- nominal output signal power;<br />\r\n- gain;<br />\r\n-
    polarization-dependent gain (PDG);<br />\r\n- maximum output signal power;<br
    />\r\n- maximum total output power.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document provides
    the test method of:<br />\r\n- gain ripple (for SOAs).<br />\r\nNOTE All numerical
    values followed by (‡) are suggested values for which the measurement is assured.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is specifically directed to single-channel amplifiers.
    Test methods for multichannel amplifiers are standardized in IEC 61290-10 (all
    parts). This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2015 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical change with respect to the previous edition: addition of
    techniques to test gain ripple of SOAs."
