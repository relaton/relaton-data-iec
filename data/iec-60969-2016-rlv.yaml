  content: "IEC 60969:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60969:2016 specifies
    performance requirements together with test methods and conditions required to
    show compliance of self-ballasted compact fluorescent lamps intended for general
    lighting services. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 1988, Amendment 1:1991 and Amendment 2:2000. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) title change;<br />\r\nb)
    scope is now limited to compact fluorescent lamps, but expanded to cover all lamps
    of voltages greater than 50 V and all power ratings;<br />\r\nc) introduction
    of requirements for lamp equivalency claims, switching withstand, starting time;<br
    />\r\nd) low temperature, run up time, treatment of claims for different operating
    conditions;<br />\r\ne) enhanced assessment and compliance criteria especially
    for lifetime;<br />\r\nf) introduction in-rush test conditions and displacement
    factor.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of January 2017 have been included
    in this copy."
