  content: "IEC 60335-2-29:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-29:2016 deals
    with the safety of electric battery chargers for household and similar use having
    an output not exceeding 120 V ripple-free direct current, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V. Battery chargers intended for charging batteries in
    a household end use application outside the scope of the IEC 60335 series of standards
    are within the scope of this standard. Requirements for battery chargers for use
    by children at least 8 years old without supervision are given in Annex AA. Battery
    chargers not intended for normal household use, but which nevertheless may be
    a source of danger to the public, such as battery chargers intended for use in
    garages, shops, light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.
    As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction; children playing
    with the appliance. This standard does not apply to built-in:<br />\r\n- battery
    chargers, except those for installing in caravans and similar vehicles;<br />\r\n-
    battery chargers that are part of an appliance, the battery of which is not accessible
    to the user;<br />\r\n- battery chargers intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- battery chargers intended to be used in locations where special conditions
    prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour
    or gas);<br />\r\n- battery chargers for emergency lighting or supply units for
    electronic equipment. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition
    published in 2002 including its Amendment 1 (2004) and its Amendment 2 (2009).
    It constitutes a technical revision. The principal changes in this edition as
    compared with the fourth edition of IEC 60335-2-29 are as follows (minor changes
    are not listed):<br />\r\n- Revised the drop test to refer to IEC 60068-2-31 (21.101);<br
    />\r\n- Requirements for supply cords on battery chargers used at low temperatures
    (25.7);<br />\r\n- Requirements for battery chargers having an output voltage
    exceeding SELV have been added (1, 3.2.2, 3.4.3, 10.101, 24.4, 25.5, 25.7, 25.8,
    25.15. 26.5);<br />\r\n- A classification for battery chargers used outdoors has
    been added (6.2, 29.2) and some notes in Clause 1, Subclauses 7.1 and 22.102,
    Figure 101 and Annex AA 11.8 have been converted to normative text. It was established
    on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard. The attention of National
    Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations
    may need a<br />\r\ntransitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with<br />\r\nthe
    new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests.
    It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this standard be
    adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than
    36 months from the date of its publication.<br />\r\nKey words: Battery, Battery
