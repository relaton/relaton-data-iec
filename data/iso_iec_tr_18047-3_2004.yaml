abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2004 defines test methods for determining the conformance
    of radio-frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in the corresponding part of ISO/IEC 18000, but
    does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.
    The test methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions
    which are implemented, be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be
    supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are
    not available in the general case.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-3:2004 includes the
    following interrogator and tag conformance parameters:</p><ul><li>mode-specific
    conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances; and</li><li>parameters
    that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 18047-3:2004 does not include the following:</p><ul><li>parameters that are
    already included in regulatory test requirements; and</li><li>high-level data
    encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).</li></ul>"
