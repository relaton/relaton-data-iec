abstract:
- content: Establishes a standard procedure for testing and classifying microcircuits
    according to their susceptibility to damage or degradation by exposure to a defined
    electrostatic Human Body Model (HBM) discharge (ESD). The objective is to provide
    reliable, repeatable HBM ESD test results so that accurate classifications can
    be performed.
