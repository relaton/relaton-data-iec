  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23006-4:2013 specifies a set of Elementary Services and protocols
    enabling distributed applications to exchange information related to content items
    and parts thereof, including all the necessary Operations on MPEG-related Entities:
    Content, Contract, Device, Event, License, Service and User. These operations
    are defined to be the following: Authenticate, Authorize, Check With, Create,
    Deliver, Describe, Identify, Install, Interact With, Negotiate, Package, Post,
    Present, Process, Request, Revoke, Search, Store, Transact, Uninstall and Verify.
    Elementary Services can be combined in well defined sequences to build Aggregated
    Services, both of them being called in general Multimedia Services. ISO/IEC 23006
    (all parts) will be referred to as MPEG-M for short in the text. The Multimedia
    Services are provided by and consumed by Multimedia Devices in a MSPT ecosystem,
    an example of which is the Advanced IPTV Terminal.</p>"
