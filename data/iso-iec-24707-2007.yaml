  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24707:2007 defines Common Logic: a first-order logic framework
    intended for information exchange and transmission. The heart of the framework
    is a complete abstract syntax and abstract semantics for Common Logic, which provides
    the basis for many different concrete syntactic forms, called dialects, which
    conform to the syntax and semantics. Common Logic has some novel features, chief
    among them being a syntax which is signature-free and permits 'higher-order' constructions
    such as quantification over classes or relations while preserving a first-order
    model theory, and a semantics which allows theories to describe intensional entities
    such as classes or properties. It also fixes the meanings of a few conventions
    in widespread use, such as numerals to denote integers and quotation marks to
    denote character strings, and has provision for the use of datatypes and for naming,
    importing and transmitting content on the World Wide Web. ISO/IEC 24707:2007 defines
    the abstract syntax and semantics, and three concrete dialects are defined in
    the annexes. The three conforming dialects specified are Common Logic Interchange
    Format (CLIF), Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF) and XML for Common Logic
    (XCL). </p>"
