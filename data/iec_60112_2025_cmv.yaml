- content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-02<p>IEC 60112:2025 CMV contains both the official
    standard and its commented version. The commented version provides you with a
    quick and easy way to compare all the changes between IEC 60112:2025 edition 6.0
    and the previous IEC 60112:2020 edition 5.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC
    112 experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes,
    or to clarify any part of the content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60112:2025 specifies
    the method of test for the determination of the proof and comparative tracking
    indices of solid insulating materials on pieces taken from parts of equipment
    and on plaques of material using alternating voltage. This document provides a
    procedure for the determination of erosion when required. The proof tracking index
    is used as an acceptance criterion as well as a means for the quality control
    of materials and fabricated parts. The comparative tracking index is mainly used
    for the basic characterization and comparison of the properties of materials.
    This test method evaluates the composition of the material as well as the surface
    of the material being evaluated. Both the composition and surface condition directly
    influence the results of the evaluation and are considered when using the results
    in material selection process. The described test method is designed for a test
    voltage up to 600 V AC, because higher test voltages and DC voltage will lead
    to a reduced test severity. Test results are not directly suitable for the evaluation
    of safe creepage distances when designing electrical apparatus. The results of
    this method have been used for insulation coordination of equipment. It is important
    that use of these results also considers the overvoltage levels, creepage distances,
    and establishes the pollution degree to which the product insulation system will
    be expected to be subjected. This is in compliance with IEC 60664-1. This basic
    safety publication focusing on a safety test method is primarily intended for
    use by technical committees in the preparation of safety publications in accordance
    with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51. One of the
    responsibilities of a technical committee is, wherever applicable, to make use
    of basic safety publications in the preparation of its publications. This sixth
    edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2020. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    In 7.3, the term \"resistivity\" has been replaced by \"conductivity\".<br />\r\nIt
    has the status of a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104.<br
    />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2026-02) has been included in this copy.</p>"
