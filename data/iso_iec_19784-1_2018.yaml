abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19784-1:2018 defines the Application Programming Interface (API)
    and Service Provider Interface (SPI) for standard interfaces within a biometric
    system that support the provision of that biometric system using components from
    multiple vendors. It provides interworking between such components through adherence
    to this and to other International Standards.<br />\r\nFor use in a system that
    does not include a BioAPI Framework (called a framework-free BioAPI system), only
    the SPI interface is applicable, with applications interfacing directly to that
    in a platform-specific manner.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Many clauses and/or sub-clauses
    of this document are not applicable for implementation of a framework-free BioAPI
    system. These are identified at the head of the clause of sub-clause.<br />\r\nThe
    BioAPI specification is applicable to a broad range of biometric technology types.
    It is also applicable to a wide variety of biometrically enabled applications,
    from personal devices, through network security applications, to large complex
    identification systems.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19784-1:2018 supports an architecture
    in which a BioAPI Framework supports multiple simultaneous biometric applications
    (provided by different vendors), using multiple dynamically installed and loaded
    (or unloaded) Biometric Service Provider (BSP) components and BioAPI Units (provided
    by other different vendors), possibly using one of an alternative set of BioAPI
    Function Provider (BFP) components (provided by other vendors) or by direct management
    of BioAPI Units.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Where BioAPI Units are provided by a different
    vendor fom a BSP, a standardised BioAPI Function Provider Interface (FPI) may
    be needed. This is outside the scope of this document, but is specified by later
    parts for the different categories of FPI.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 Where a BioAPI Framework
    is not used in a system, the ability to support multiple applications and multiple
    BSPs is platform-dependent and depends on the nature of the system-integration
    techniques employed.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19784-1:2018 is not required (and should
    normally not be referenced) when a complete biometric system is being procured
    from a single vendor, particularly if the addition or interchange of biometric
    hardware, services, or applications is not a feature of that biometric system.
    (Such systems are sometimes referred to as \"embedded systems\".) Standardisation
    of such systems is not in the scope of this document.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19784-1:2018
    does not define security requirements for biometric applications and biometric
    service providers.<br />\r\nNOTE 4 ISO 19092 provides guidelines on security aspects
    of biometric systems[3].<br />\r\nThe performance of biometric systems (particularly
    in relation to searches of a large population to provide the biometric identification
    capability) is not in the scope of this document. Trade-offs between interoperability
    and performance are not in the scope of this document.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19784-1:2018
    specifies a version of the BioAPI specification that is defined to have a version
    number described as Major 2, Minor 0, or version 2.0. It also specifies a version
    number described as Major 2, Minor 1, or version 2.1 that provides an enhanced
    Graphical User Interface. It also specifies a version number described as Major
    2, Minor 2, or version 2.2 that provides features supporting fusion and security.
    Some clauses and sub-clauses apply only to one of these versions, some to two
    or more. This is identified at the head of the relevant clauses and sub-clauses.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 5 Earlier versions of the BioAPI specification were not International
    Standards.<br />\r\nNOTE 6 The differences between the requirements of the 2.0
    specification and the 2.1 specification for framework-free operation relate only
    to the biometric type values and encodings.<br />\r\nConformance requirements
    are specified in Clause 5."
