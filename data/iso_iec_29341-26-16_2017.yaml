    that allows control points, or better known as Telephony Control Points (TelCP),
    to manage presence information through a Telephony Server (TS) device or a Telephony
    Client (TC) device (in the role of UPnP server device for Presence service). This
    service provides control points with the following functionality:<br />\r\n- Presence
    of contacts, access the presence information of contacts, as provided by the UPnP
    Telephony Server device. Contacts referenced by the Presence service may be managed
    via PhoneManagement service and the Phone Data Model.<br />\r\n- Managing presence
    information, update the presence status stored in the TS;<br />\r\nThis service
    does not provide the following functionality:<br />\r\n- To update the presence
    status of the local UPnP network, from the UPnP server device to remote presence
    servers (i.e. outside the local UPnP network).<br />\r\n- To retrieve the presence
    information of contacts from remote presence servers (i.e. outside the local UPnP
    network).<br />\r\nWhen the features provided by the Presence service are associated
    to the PhoneManagement features, then an integrated management of the address
    book and the presence of contacts in the address book can be delivered."
