abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the service description and control
    aspects, including functional capabilities and</p><p>information flows, of standardised
    circuit-mode bearer services which may be supported by a Private Integrated Services</p><p>Network
    (PISN).</p><p>This International Standard includes the following basic services:</p><p>_
    Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s unrestricted 8 kHz structured bearer service category;</p><p>_
    Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s 8 kHz structured bearer service category usable for speech
    information transfer;</p><p>_ Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s 8 kHz structured bearer service
    category usable for 3,1 kHz audio information transfer.</p><p>A PISN shall support
    at least one of the above three bearer services to conform with this International
    Standard.</p><p>The scope of this International Standard does not include:</p><p>_
    the negotiation of service at call establishment time,</p><p>_ the change of service
    during a call, and</p><p>_ unidirectional services.</p><p>This International Standard
    includes optional procedures for the provision of functions equivalent to the
    following public ISDN</p><p>supplementary services: Subaddress and Multiple Subscriber
    Number.</p><p>NOTE 1 - Supplementary services and other bearer services which
    can be used in conjunction with 64 kbit/s circuit switched bearer services</p><p>specified
    in this International Standard are dealt with in other standards.</p><p>NOTE 2
    - Service specifications are based on information concerning the corresponding
    public ISDN service available at the time of</p><p>publication of this International
    Standard.</p><p>NOTE 3 - ITU-T treat Subaddressing and Multiple Subscriber Number
    as supplementary services.</p><p>NOTE 4 - The use of the Direct Dial In supplementary
    service of a public ISDN for calls incoming to a PISN from a public ISDN is regarded</p><p>as
    part of the basic services in a PISN.</p><p>NOTE 5 - The use of the Calling Line
    Identification Presentation and Connected Line Identification Presentation supplementary
    services of a</p><p>public ISDN for obtaining the Originating Number or the Connected
    Number of a call from or to a public ISDN is regarded as part of the</p><p>basic
    services in a PISN.</p><p>NOTE 6 - The provision (either explicitly or implicitly)
    by the user to the network, of its own number (Originating Number or Connected</p><p>Number),
    and the provision of an Originating Number or a Connected Number by a PISN to
    another network is a part of the basic services in</p><p>a PISN and not a part
    of the Calling Line Identification Presentation and Connected Line Identification
    Presentation supplementary services.</p><p>Those supplementary services are concerned
    only with the presentation of the number from the network to the served PISN user.</p>"
