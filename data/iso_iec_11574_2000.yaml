abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the service description and control aspects,
    including functional capabilities and<br />\r\ninformation flows, of standardised
    circuit-mode bearer services which may be supported by a Private Integrated Services<br
    />\r\nNetwork (PISN).<br />\r\nThis International Standard includes the following
    basic services:<br />\r\n_ Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s unrestricted 8 kHz structured
    bearer service category;<br />\r\n_ Circuit-mode 64 kbit/s 8 kHz structured bearer
    service category usable for speech information transfer;<br />\r\n_ Circuit-mode
    64 kbit/s 8 kHz structured bearer service category usable for 3,1 kHz audio information
    transfer.<br />\r\nA PISN shall support at least one of the above three bearer
    services to conform with this International Standard.<br />\r\nThe scope of this
    International Standard does not include:<br />\r\n_ the negotiation of service
    at call establishment time,<br />\r\n_ the change of service during a call, and<br
    />\r\n_ unidirectional services.<br />\r\nThis International Standard includes
    optional procedures for the provision of functions equivalent to the following
    public ISDN<br />\r\nsupplementary services: Subaddress and Multiple Subscriber
    Number.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 - Supplementary services and other bearer services which
    can be used in conjunction with 64 kbit/s circuit switched bearer services specified
    in this International Standard are dealt with in other standards.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 - Service specifications are based on information concerning the corresponding
    public ISDN service available at the time of<br />\r\npublication of this International
    Standard.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 - ITU-T treat Subaddressing and Multiple Subscriber
    Number as supplementary services.<br />\r\nNOTE 4 - The use of the Direct Dial
    In supplementary service of a public ISDN for calls incoming to a PISN from a
    public ISDN is regarded as part of the basic services in a PISN.<br />\r\nNOTE
    5 - The use of the Calling Line Identification Presentation and Connected Line
    Identification Presentation supplementary services of a public ISDN for obtaining
    the Originating Number or the Connected Number of a call from or to a public ISDN
    is regarded as part of the basic services in a PISN.<br />\r\nNOTE 6 - The provision
    (either explicitly or implicitly) by the user to the network, of its own number
    (Originating Number or Connected Number), and the provision of an Originating
    Number or a Connected Number by a PISN to another network is a part of the basic
    services in a PISN and not a part of the Calling Line Identification Presentation
    and Connected Line Identification Presentation supplementary services.<br />\r\nThose
    supplementary services are concerned only with the presentation of the number
    from the network to the served PISN user."
