    <p>This document specifies required characteristics of a domain-neutral top-level ontology (TLO) that can be used in tandem with domain ontologies at lower levels to support data exchange, retrieval, discovery, integration and analysis.</p>
    <p>If an ontology is to provide the overarching ontology content that will promote interoperability of domain ontologies and thereby support the design and use of purpose-built ontology suites, then it needs to satisfy certain requirements. This document specifies these requirements. It also supports a variety of other goals related to the achievement of semantic interoperability, for example, as concerns legacy ontologies developed using heterogeneous upper-level categories, where a coherently designed TLO can provide a target for coordinated re-engineering.</p>
    <p>This document specifies the characteristics an ontology needs to possess to support the goals of exchange, retrieval, discovery, integration and analysis of data by computer systems.</p>
    <p>The following are within the scope of this document</p>
    <p>—    Specification of the requirements an ontology needs to satisfy if it is to serve as a top-level hub ontology.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of the relations between a top-level ontology and domain ontologies.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of the role played by the terms in a top-level ontology in the formulation of definitions and axioms in ontologies at lower levels.</p>
    <p>The following are outside the scope of this document:</p>
    <p>—    Specification of ontology languages, including the languages OWL 2 and CL, used in ontology development with standard model-theoretic semantics.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of methods for reasoning with ontologies.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of translators between notations of ontologies developed in different ontology languages.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of rules governing the use of IRIs as permanent identifiers for ontology terms.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of the principles of ontology maintenance and versioning.</p>
    <p>—    Specification of how ontologies can be used in the tagging or annotation of data.</p>
