  content: "IEC 60335-2-80:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-80:2024 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-80:2015
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-80:2024 deals with the safety of electric fans for
    household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V
    for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of
    the types of fans that this standard is applicable to are<br />\r\n- ceiling fans;<br
    />\r\n- duct fans;<br />\r\n- infant fans;<br />\r\n- partition fans;<br />\r\n-
    pedestal fans;<br />\r\n- table fans.<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to separate
    controls supplied with fans.<br />\r\nInfant fans are also tested to the applicable
    requirements of the ISO 8124 series, since it covers hazards other than those
    arising from the use of electricity such as toxicological hazards.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended for use in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n- fans incorporated in other appliances.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) introduction
    of requirements for infant fans (7.12, 7.12.1, 8.1.1, 11.8, 20.2, 21.103, 22.44,
    22.54, 22.102, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) introduction of the use of test probe
    19 (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\ne) introduction of surface temperature
    limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nf) clarification of testing of fans for use in a
    tropical climate (5.7, Annex P 11.8);<br />\r\ng) clarification of requirements
    for remote operation of fans (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to
    be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
