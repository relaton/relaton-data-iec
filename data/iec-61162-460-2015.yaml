  content: IEC 61162-460:2015(E) is an add-on to the IEC 61162-450 standard where
    higher safety and security standards are needed, e.g. due to higher exposure to
    external threats or to improve network integrity. This standard provides requirements
    and test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network
    as well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection
    from the network to other networks. This standard also contains requirements for
    a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This standard extends the informative
    guidance given in Annex D of IEC 61162-450:2011. It does not introduce new application
    level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450.
