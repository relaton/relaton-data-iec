  content: "Recently, climate change issues have gained considerable attention, and
    a worldwide consensus has been reached on the promotion of sustainable development
    through renewable energy. However, the large-scale adoption of renewable energy
    sources can pose technical challenges for ensuring a secure and unbroken energy
    supply. Such challenges can be mitigated by the adoption of multi-energy coupling
    systems, which increase the flexibility of the overall energy system and balance
    the fluctuations of renewable energy sources.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis technology
    and market outlook paper (TMOP) provides an introduction to multi-energy coupling
    systems and presents an analysis of the concept and services, as well as the opportunities
    and challenges faced in the context of carbon neutrality. It analyzes the current
    development of international standards for multi-energy coupled smart energy systems
    and the further standardization needs of such systems.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    TMOP has been prepared by a project team representing a variety of organizations,
    working under the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis TMOP is available for
    <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/multi-energy-coupling-system\">free download</a>."
