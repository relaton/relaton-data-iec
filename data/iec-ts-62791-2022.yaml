  content: "IEC TS 62791:2022 defines terms and specifies methods for quantifying
    detailed imaging performance of real-time, ultrasound B-mode scanners. Detail
    is assessed by imaging phantoms containing small, low-echo spherical targets in
    a tissue-mimicking background and analysing sphere detectability. Specifications
    are given for phantom properties. In addition, procedures are described for acquiring
    images, conducting qualitative analysis of sphere detectability, and carrying
    out quantitative analysis by detecting sphere locations and computing their contrast-to-noise
    ratios. With appropriate choices in design, results can be applied, for example:<br
    />\r\n• to assess the relative ability of scanner configurations (scanner make
    and model, scan head and console settings) to delineate the boundary of a tumour
    or identify specific features of tumours;<br />\r\n• to choose scanner control
    settings, such as frequency or the number and location of transmit foci, which
    maximize spatial resolution;<br />\r\n• to detect defects in probes causing enhanced
    sidelobes and spurious echoes.<br />\r\nThe types of transducers used with these
    scanners include:<br />\r\na) phased arrays,<br />\r\nb) linear arrays,<br />\r\nc)
    convex arrays,<br />\r\nd) mechanical sector scanners,<br />\r\ne) 3-D probes
    operating in 2-D imaging mode, and<br />\r\nf) 3-D probes operating in 3-D imaging
    mode for a limited number of sets of reconstructed 2 D images.<br />\r\nThe test
    methodology is applicable for transducers operating in the 1 MHz to 23 MHz frequency
    range.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62791:2022 cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition.<br />\r\na) It introduces necessary corrections to the analysis methods;
    these have been published in the literature.<br />\r\nb) It increases the range
    of contrast levels of low-echo spheres in phantoms that meet this Technical Specification.
    Previous specification was -20 dB, but two additional levels, -6 dB and either
    -30 dB or, if possible, -40 dB, are now specified.<br />\r\nc) It includes a wider
    range of uses of the methodology, including testing the effectiveness of scanner
    pre-sets for specific clinical tasks and detecting flaws in transducers and in
    beamforming.<br />\r\nd) It decreases the manufacturing cost by decreasing phantoms'
    dimensions and numbers of low-echo, backscattering spheres embedded in each phantom."
