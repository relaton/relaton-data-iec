    <p>ISO/IEC 14143-6:2006 provides a summary of the FSM (Functional Size Measurement) related International Standards and the relationship between;</p>
    <ul><li>the ISO/IEC 14143 series FSM framework International Standards that provide the definitions and concepts of FSM and conformance and verification of FSMMs (Functional Size Measurement Methods), and </li><li>the ISO/IEC standard FSMMs, i.e. ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926, ISO/IEC 20968 and ISO/IEC 24570.</li></ul>
    <p>An FSMM is a software sizing method that conforms to the mandatory requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 14143-6 also provides a process to assist users to select an FSMM that meets their requirements. It also gives guidance on how to use Functional Size (FS). </p>
    <p>FSMMs include, but are not limited to, ISO/IEC 19761, ISO/IEC 20926, ISO/IEC 20968 and ISO/IEC 24570, as well. </p>
    <p>Recommending a specific FSMM is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 14143-6.</p>
