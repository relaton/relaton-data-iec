  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-18-13:2011(E) describes a service definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a service type referred
    to herein as RATAConfig service. The RATAConfig service is a UPnP service that
    allows control points to provision and configure the parameters that are required
    for enabling a Remote Access Server to accept and a Remote Access Client to initiate
    remote access connections. This service provides control points with the following
    functionality:<br/>                      \n- Determine the Remote Access Transport
    Agents that can be configured by the service.<br/>                                    \n-
    Determine the delivery mechanisms for credentials supported by the service.<br/>
    \                                                     \n- Configure Remote Access
    Transport Agent profiles.<br/>           \n- Management of Remote Access Transport
    Agent profiles."
