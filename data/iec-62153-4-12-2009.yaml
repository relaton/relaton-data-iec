  content: "IEC 62153-4-13:2009(E) details the method of test to determine the coupling
    attenuation or screening attenuation for connecting hardware used in analogue
    and digital communication systems. The test method details means to test one part
    of a connecting hardware (e. g. wall outlet or plug alone) as well as testing
    a mated pair of connecting hardware.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to
