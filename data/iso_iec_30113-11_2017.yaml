abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30113-11:2017 defines single-point gestures for common system
    actions used in information and communication technology (ICT) systems. It specifies
    movements for clear and classified gestures recognized by the systems and applications.
    The single-point gestures are performed using an input device (e.g. a mouse, a
    stylus, etc.) or a body part (e.g. a fingertip, a hand, etc.). These single-point
    gestures are intended to operate in a consistent manner regardless of the system,
    platform, application or device.<br />\r\nNOTE ICT systems include, but are not
    limited to, digital televisions, set-top boxes, video game consoles, communication
    devices, Internet devices, entertainment devices and personal computers."
