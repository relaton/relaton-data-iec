abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011 provides a Conceptual Reference Model that comprises
    categories of items, attributes, and relationships. It can be used to identify
    the relationships between concepts represented within an information technology
    for learning, education and training (ITLET) system, such as competency, knowledge,
    skills, capabilities, qualifications, performance, and learning objectives. It
    can be used to identify related objects that are used to convey competency information.
    ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011 pertains to the exchange and integration of heterogeneous
    information relating to information technology (IT) systems that are used by learning,
    education and training (LET) organizations and their communities in order to manage,
    develop, describe, transfer or assess competency information or other related
    objects. The scope is further elaborated as follows. - ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011 provides
    guidance regarding the level of detail and precision expected and required to
    describe, in relation to the ITLET Conceptual Reference Model, IT systems that
    are used to manage, develop, describe, transfer or assess competency information
    or other related objects within the LET fields. - ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011 provides
    a definition of competency (ITLET) specific to competency as it is represented
    within an IT system. This definition is not domain dependent and acknowledges
    the unique challenges of representing competency information within IT systems.
    - ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011 is intended specifically to introduce requisite contextual
    information, i.e. the environment, which can, for example, include information
    such as location description, duration, date and time. - The exchange of relevant
    information from IT systems among LET organizations and their communities, and
    harmonization with their models, fall within the scope of ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011.
    - ISO/IEC TR 24763:2011 introduces the topic of privacy needs as they relate to
    IT systems that are used by LET organizations in order to manage, develop, describe,
    transfer or assess competency information or other related objects. - ISO/IEC
    TR 24763:2011 focuses on information about participants, related elements, and
    the respective relationships included within IT systems in LET that are used to
    manage, develop, describe, transfer or assess competency information or other
    related objects.
