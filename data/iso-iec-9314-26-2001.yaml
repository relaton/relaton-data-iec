  content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) is intended for use in a high
    performance general-purpose multi-station network and is designed for efficient
    operation with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token Ring Architecture
    with optical fibre as the transmission medium. FDDI provides for hundreds of stations
    operating over an extent of tens of kilometers. The FDDI Media Access Control
    (MAC) standard, ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314-2, specifies the lower sub-layer of the Data
    Link Layer for FDDI. It specifies access to the medium, including addressing,
    data checking and data framing. ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314-2 also specifies the receiver
    and transmitter state machines. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314 is an abstract
    test suite (ATS) conformance test for FDDI MAC. Since MAC is a protocol that deals
    primarily with complete PDUs, the Tree and Tabular Combined Notation TTCN language
    specified in ISO&#x2F;IEC 9646-3 is used to specify MAC protocol tests.
