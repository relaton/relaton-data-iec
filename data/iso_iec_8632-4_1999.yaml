abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    part of ISO/IEC 8632-4:1999 specifies a clear text encoding of the Computer Graphics
    Metafile. For each of the elements specified in ISO/IEC 8632-1, a clear text encoding
    is specified. Allowed abbreviations are specified. The overall format of the metafile
    and the means by which comments may be interspersed in the metafile is specified.<br
    />\r\nThis encoding of the CGM allows metafiles to be created and maintained in
    a form which is simple to type, easy to edit and convenient to read."
