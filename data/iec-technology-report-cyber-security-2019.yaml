  content: "The energy business sector is undergoing profound changes. The transition
    to clean energy is underway and society is increasingly reliant on electrical
    energy. However, the business environment is more risky and mounting competition
    requires the continual improvement of end-user services.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSimultaneously,
    the energy sector has accelerated its evolution towards digitization thus heightening
    its reliance on cyber assets, including systems, controllers and intelligent devices,
    to manage the delivery of electrical energy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, these
    cyber assets present serious challenges and businesses must determine how to cope
    with the reality of deliberate cyber attacks as well as how to remain resilient
    in the face of inadvertent cyber threats arising from personnel mistakes, the
    complexity of systems, equipment failure and natural disaster. Energy businesses
    that traditionally addressed only the system engineering process must now include
    cyber security services and technologies.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC Technology
    Report provides guidelines to help executives in the smart energy operational
    environment understand the necessary cyber security policies, procedures and technologies
    that need to be implemented. It was prepared by the task force on cyber security
    in the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:186:0::::FSP_ORG_ID:11825\">IEC
    Systems Committee on Smart energy</a> Working Group 3.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    IEC Technology Report is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/cyber-security-and-resilience-guidelines-smart-energy-operational-environment\">free
