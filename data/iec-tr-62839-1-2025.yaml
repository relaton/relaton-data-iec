  content: "IEC TR 62839-1:2025 describes the product specific rules (PSR) for wires
    and cables used for communication, data, control and command.<br />\r\nThese PSR
    are applicable in case the life cycle assessment (LCA) results are intended to
    be used in external communication in the form of an environmental product declaration
    (EPD), as laid out in ISO 14021, ISO 14025, ISO 14026 and ISO 14067. These PSR
    are complementary to the product category rules (PCR) for (LCA) of electrical
    and electronic products and systems (EEPS) provided in IEC 63366.<br />\r\nThe
    following categories of wires and cables are covered in this document:<br />\r\n–
    communication and data wires and cables which can comprise metallic conductors
    or optical fibre;<br />\r\n– control and command wires and cables which can comprise
    metallic conductors or optical fibre.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to
    communication cables in general, it is related in particular to the wire and cable
    products covered by generic cabling described in the ISO/IEC 11801 series which
    is based on component standards described in the IEC 60794 series (fibre optic
    cables), IEC 61156 series (metallic balanced communication cables) and the IEC
    61196 series (coaxial metallic communication cables). According to this relationship,
    this document is related to ISO/IEC 14763-5 which describes sustainability aspect
    of generic cabling.<br />\r\nThis document is primarily intended for:<br />\r\n–
    environment and/or product managers;<br />\r\n– LCA experts in companies or contractors
    and other 3rd party operators, in charge of EPD;<br />\r\n– verifiers in charge
    of conformity assessment in accordance with the defined rules.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    The term \"accessory products\" has been removed from the title and the text as
    accessories are covered by IEC TR 62839-2.<br />\r\nb) The consideration of remote
    powering was added for the evaluation of the use stage.<br />\r\nc) Guidance was
    added with respect to evaluate the use stage of certain coaxial cables.<br />\r\nd)
    Update of the entire document to reflect a complete life cycle assessment."
