abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61968-14:2015(E) explains how to do a mapping from CIM to MultiSpeak
    using an XML mapping tool, and the inclusion of an example project that gives
    practical guidance on the interoperability and mapping of source and destination
    applications through an ESB using an on demand meter read as the archetype. This
    technical specification will also cover the mapping of IEC 61968-9:2009 profiles
    to equivalent MultiSpeak v.4.1x message profiles.
