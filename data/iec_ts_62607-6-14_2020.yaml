abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-14:2020 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the structural key control characteristic<br />\r\n• defect level<br />\r\nfor
    powders consisting of graphene-based material by<br />\r\n• Raman spectroscopy.<br
    />\r\nThe defect level is derived by the intensity ratio of the D+D′ band and
    2D band in Raman spectrum, ID+D′/I2D.<br />\r\n• The defect level determined in
    accordance with this document will be listed as a key control characteristic in
    the blank detail specification for graphene IEC 62565-3-1 for graphene powder.<br
    />\r\n• The method is applicable for graphene powder or graphene-based material,
    e.g. reduced graphene oxide (rGO), bilayer graphene, trilayer graphene and few-layer
    graphene.<br />\r\n• Typical application areas are quality control and classification
    for graphene manufacturers, and product selection for downstream users.<br />\r\n•
    The method described in this document is appropriate if the physical form of graphene
    is powder."
