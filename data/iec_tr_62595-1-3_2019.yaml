abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62595-1-3:2019 (E) focuses on common issues of light emission such
    as spatial uniformity of luminance and colour, and angular distribution of luminance
    and colour, from lighting units with arbitrary shapes like flexible lighting sources
    (FLSs). This document provides a model of light emission from a curved FLS and
    of light measurement on a curved FLS. Because the development of flexible liquid
    crystal panels is in progress (see the notes), the intent of this document is
    to provide guidance for the development of future measurement standards. This
    document is applicable to FLSs either as light sources, products or elements with
    arbitrary shapes of geometrical curvature having different spectral and spatial
    characteristics of light emission.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Almost 20 years ago plastic
    LCDs were developed and used in a few applications.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Flexible BLUs
    have been used for bendable LC panels in recent years.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 Recent
    transmissive and transflective flexible LCs require flexible BLUs."
