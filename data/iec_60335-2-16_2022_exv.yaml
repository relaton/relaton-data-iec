abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-16:2022 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-16:2022 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-16:2022 deals with the safety
    of electric food waste disposers for household and similar purposes, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household
    use but that nevertheless possibly pose a source of danger to the public, such
    as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on
    farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar
    authorities, leading to restriction of or prohibition of the installation of food
    waste disposers.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– portable
    food waste disposers;<br />\r\n– food waste disposers of the incinerator type;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial or commercial purposes;<br
    />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2002,
    Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 22.104);<br />\r\nc)
    addition of temperature rise limits for accessible surface (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
