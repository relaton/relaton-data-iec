- content: "<p>ISO/IEC19763-1:2015 (Metamodel framework for interoperability) (MFI)
    family of standards. As the first part of MFI, this part provides an overview
    of the whole of MFI. In particular, the purpose, the underlying concepts, the
    overall architecture and the requirements for the development of other standards
    within the MFI family are described.</p><p>MFI provides a set of normative metamodels
    to enable the registration of many different types of model. Each of these metamodels
    is expressed as a UML Class Diagram.</p><p>MFI is evolving. Currently, in addition
    to this part, the MFI family comprises:</p><p>· A core model and facilities for
    the basic mapping of models (Part 10)</p><p>· A metamodel for ontology registration
    (Part 3)</p><p>· A metamodel for process model registration (Part 5)</p><p>· A
    metamodel for service model registration (Part 7)</p><p>· A metamodel for role
    and goal model registration (Part 8)</p><p>· A Technical Report describing on
    demand model selection based on RGPS (Role, Goal, Process and Service) (Part 9)</p><p>·
    A metamodel for information model registration (Part 12)</p><p>· A metamodel for
    form design registration (Part 13)</p><p>· A metamodel for a registry summary
    (Part 6)</p><p>These parts are described in more detail in Annex A.</p>"
