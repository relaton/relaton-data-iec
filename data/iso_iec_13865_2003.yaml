abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    13865:2003 specifies Supplementary Service Call Transfer (SS-CT), which is applicable
    to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs).
    Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nSS-CT is a supplementary
    service which enables a user to transform two of that user's calls (of which one
    must be answered) into a new call between the other two users of the two calls.<br
    />\r\nSupplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according
    to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13865:2003 contains the stage
    1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-CT. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies
    the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification
    (clauses 7 and 8) identifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary
    service and the information flows between them.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 13865:2003 contains
    two stage 2 specifications reflecting different ways of operating the service
    within the network: transfer by join and transfer by rerouteing."
