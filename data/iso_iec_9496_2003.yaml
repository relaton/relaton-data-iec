abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 9496:2003 defines the ITU-T
    programming language CHILL. CHILL is a strongly typed, block structured and object-oriented
    language designed primarily for the implementation of large and complex embedded
    systems.</p><p>CHILL was designed to provide reliability and run time efficiency,
    at the same time sufficient flexibility and powerfulness to encompass the required
    range of applications. CHILL also provides facilities that encourage piecewise
    and modular development of large systems.</p>
