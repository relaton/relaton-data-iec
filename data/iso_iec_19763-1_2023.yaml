abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides an overview of the whole
    ISO/IEC 19763 series. This overview includes the purpose, the underlying concepts,
    the overall architecture and the requirements for the development of other standards
    within the 19763 series.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Collectively, the other parts
    of the ISO/IEC 19763 series provide a set of normative metamodels to enable the
    registration of many different types of model. Each of these metamodels is expressed
    both as a UML class diagram and, more formally, in text. The metamodels, along
    with the specification in ISO/IEC 11179-3, define the information about the models
    that is to be registered. The models themselves can be stored in a model repository
    or can just exist as paper documents.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The ISO/IEC 19763
    series does not specify any physical structure of a registry where model information
    is to be recorded.</p>
