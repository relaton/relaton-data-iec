    IEC 61435:2013(E) is applicable to high-purity germanium crystals used for radiation detectors for gamma-rays and X-rays. Such germanium is monocrystalline and has a net concentration of fewer than 10<sup>11</sup> electrically active impurity centers per cm<sup>3</sup>. This International Standard specifies terminology and test methods for measurements of basic characteristics of high-purity germanium crystals. Test methods for completed assembled germanium detectors are given in IEC 60973 and IEC 60759. The main technical changes with regard to the previous edition are as follows:<br />
    - review the existing requirements;<br />
    - update the terminology and definitions.
