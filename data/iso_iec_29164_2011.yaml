abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29164:2011 provides a standard interface to hardware biometric
    modules designed to be integrated in embedded systems which can be constrained
    in memory and computational power. It specifies a full interface for such hardware-based
    biometric modules. This interface, called Embedded BioAPI, is defined by the specification
    of commands to be implemented by these modules. Such a specification is done on
    two levels.Low level implementation is not covered by ISO/IEC 29164:2011.Security
    mechanisms, although considered, are outside of the scope of ISO/IEC 29164:2011,
    and are referred to in other relevant standards. In particular, key management
    is outside of the scope of ISO/IEC 29164:2011, and is expected to be done prior
    to the application of ISO/IEC 29164:2011.Specifications and requirements for Embedded
    BioAPI subcomponents, or any kind of devices suitable to implement Embedded BioAPI,
    are also outside of the scope of ISO/IEC 29164:2011.
