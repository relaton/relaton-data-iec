abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 27013:2015 provides guidance on the integrated implementation
    of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 for those organizations that are intending
    to either</p><p>a) implement ISO/IEC 27001 when ISO/IEC 20000‑1 is already implemented,
    or vice versa,</p><p>b) implement both ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 together,
    or</p><p>c) integrate existing management systems based on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC
    20000‑1.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27013:2015 focuses exclusively on the integrated implementation
    of an information security management system (ISMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 27001
    and a service management system (SMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 20000‑1.</p><p>In
    practice, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 can also be integrated with other
    management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.</p>"
