  content: applies to interface systems used to interconnect both programmable and
    nonprogrammable electronic measuring apparatus with other apparatus and accessories
    necessary to assemble instrumentation systems. It applies to the interface of
    instrumentation systems, or portions of them,The basic functional specifications
    of this standard may be used in digital interface applications that require longer
    distances, more devices, increased noise immunity, or combinations of these.It
    bears double logo IEC/IEEE
