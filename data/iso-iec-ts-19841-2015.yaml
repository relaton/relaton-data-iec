    <p>ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language (1.3) that enable the specification of Transactional Memory. These extensions include new syntactic forms and modifications to existing language and library.</p>
    <p>The International Standard, ISO/IEC 14882, provides important context and specification for this Technical Specification. This document is written as a set of changes against that specification. Instructions to modify or add paragraphs are written as explicit instructions. Modifications made directly to existing text from the International Standard use <b>green</b> to represent added text and strikethrough to represent deleted text.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 19841:2015 is non-normative. Some of the functionality described by this Technical Specification may be considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but it is not currently part any C++ standard. Some of the functionality in this Technical Specification may never be standardized, and other functionality may standardized in a substantially changed form.</p>
    <p>The goal of this Technical Specification is to build widespread existing practice for Transactional Memory. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them</p>
