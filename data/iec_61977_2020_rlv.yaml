abstract:
- content: "IEC 61977:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61977:2020
    applies to the family of fibre optic filters. These components have all of the
    following general features:<br />\r\n- they are passive for the reason that they
    contain no optoelectronic or other transducing elements which can process the
    optical signal launched into the input port;<br />\r\n- they modify the spectral
    intensity distribution in order to select some wavelengths and inhibit others;<br
    />\r\n- they are fixed, i.e. the modification of the spectral intensity distribution
    is fixed and cannot be tuned;<br />\r\n- they have input and output ports or a
    common port (having both functions of input and output) for the transmission of
    optical power; the ports are optical fibre or optical fibre connectors;<br />\r\n-
    they differ according to their characteristics. They can be divided into the following
    categories:<br />\r\n- short-wave pass (only wavelengths lower than or equal to
    a specified value are passed);<br />\r\n- long-wave pass (only wavelengths greater
    than or equal to a specified value are passed);<br />\r\n- band-pass (only an
    optical window is allowed);<br />\r\n- notch (only an optical window is inhibited);<br
    />\r\n- gain flattening (compensating the spectral profile of the device).<br
    />\r\nIt is also possible to have a combination of the above categories. This
    document provides the generic information including terminology of IEC 61753-04x
    series documents. Published IEC 61753-04x series documents are listed in the Bibliography.
    This document establishes uniform requirements for optical, mechanical and environmental
    properties. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- change of the title and the scope for the limitation to fibre optic fixed
    filters;<br />\r\n- addition of new terms and definitions reflecting new title;<br
    />\r\n- removal of terms and definitions duplicated in IEC TS 62627-09;<br />\r\n-
    harmonization of the vertical axis of Figures 1 to 5;<br />\r\n- restructuration
    of Clause 4 reflecting the latest technical and market situation."
