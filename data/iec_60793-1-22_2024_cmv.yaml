abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-22:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60793-1-22:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 60793-1-22:2001
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 86A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-22:2024 establishes uniform requirements for measuring
    the length and elongation of optical fibre (typically within cable). The length
    of an optical fibre is a fundamental value for the evaluation of transmission
    characteristics such as losses and bandwidths."
