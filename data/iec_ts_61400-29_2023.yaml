abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-29:2023, which is a Technical Specification, instils good
    practice for aviation lighting and marking of wind turbines in both onshore and
    offshore domains. Consideration is given to visible lighting and infrared (IR)
    lighting, which is necessary to maintain conspicuity to users of night vision
    goggles (NVGs). ICAO Annex 14 Standards and Recommended Practices have been used
    as the basis to develop supplementary harmonised specifications to assist with
    implementation.<br />\r\nThis document provides a set of technical requirements
    for marking and lighting of wind turbines with a tip height from/at 150 meters
    and below 315 meters Above Ground Level (AGL), or Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL)
    for offshore sites. This will improve situational awareness for airspace users,
    maintain safety of aircraft flying in the vicinity of wind turbines, and provide
    additional tools to assist with the reduction in environmental impacts consistent
    with aviation safety objectives."
