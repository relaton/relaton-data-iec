    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61347-2-10:2024
    specifies safety requirements for electronic controlgear for high-frequency operation
    of tubular cold-cathode discharge lamps used in signs and luminous discharge tube
    installations and operating with an output voltage exceeding 1 000 V but not exceeding
    10 000 V for direct connection to DC or AC supply voltages not exceeding 1 000
    V (at 50 Hz or 60 Hz in case of alternating current). This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2000 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
