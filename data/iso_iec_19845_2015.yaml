abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 19845:2015 specifies the
    OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL), which defines a generic XML interchange
    format for business documents that can be restricted or extended to meet the requirements
    of particular industries. Specifically, UBL provides the following:</p><p>- A
    suite of structured business objects and their associated semantics expressed
    as reusable data components and common business documents.</p><p>- A library of
    XML schemas for reusable data components such as "Address", "Item", and "Payment",
    the common data elements of everyday business documents.</p><p>- A set of XML
    schemas for common business documents such as "Order", "Despatch Advice", and
    "Invoice" that are constructed from the UBL library components and can be used
    in generic procurement and transportation contexts.</p>
