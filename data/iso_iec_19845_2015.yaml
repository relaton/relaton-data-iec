abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19845:2015 specifies the OASIS Universal Business Language (UBL), which defines
    a generic XML interchange format for business documents that can be restricted
    or extended to meet the requirements of particular industries. Specifically, UBL
    provides the following:<br />\r\n- A suite of structured business objects and
    their associated semantics expressed as reusable data components and common business
    documents.<br />\r\n- A library of XML schemas for reusable data components such
    as \"Address\", \"Item\", and \"Payment\", the common data elements of everyday
    business documents.<br />\r\n- A set of XML schemas for common business documents
    such as \"Order\", \"Despatch Advice\", and \"Invoice\" that are constructed from
    the UBL library components and can be used in generic procurement and transportation
    contexts."
