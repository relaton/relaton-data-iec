abstract:
- content: "The Internet of Thing (IoT) is an infrastructure of interconnected objects,
    people or systems that processes and reacts to physical and virtual information.
    IoT collectively uses today’s Internet backbone to connect things using sensors
    and other technologies. Through data collection and analysis it achieves a multitude
    of outcomes that generally aim to improve user experience or the performance of
    devices and systems.<br /><br />\r\nHow data is collected and implemented will
    determine how transformational IoT can become. Security grows exponentially in
    importance as devices that where once isolated become interconnected and more
    and more information is collected. As with most disruptive technologies solutions
    are developed by a wide range of providers promoting their proprietary approaches
    which can also impact interconnectivity. Bringing the ambitious visions expressed
    by IoT to reality will require significant efforts in standardization.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis White Paper aims to provide an overview of today’s IoT, including its
    limitations and deficiencies in the area of security, interoperability and scalability.
    It contains use cases that point to requirements for smart and secure IoT platforms.
    It also discusses next generation platform-level technologies and provides important
    recommendations to IoT stakeholders and for IoT standardization work.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis White Paper was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) IoT
    2020 project team with major contributions from SAP and Fraunhofer AISEC.<br /><br
    />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for free download."
