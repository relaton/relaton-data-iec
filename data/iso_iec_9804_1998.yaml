abstract:
- content: "<p>This Recommendation | International Standard is intended for reference
    by other specifications when the functionality of</p><p>commitment, concurrency
    and recovery is required. It can be referenced whenever the processing of two
    or more</p><p>application-entity invocations in a distributed application needs
    to be organized into an atomic action.</p><p>This Recommendation | International
    Standard defines services that are used on a single association to coordinate
    two</p><p>application-entity invocations involved in an atomic action. The determination
    of which application-entity invocations</p><p>are involved in an atomic action
    is not within the scope of this Recommendation | International Standard.</p><p>This
    Recommendation | International Standard establishes the general principles for
    the coordinated use of the CCR</p><p>services when more than two application-entity
    invocations are involved in a single atomic action, or when recovery is</p><p>required
    after failure. The coordination of multiple associations and the related application-entity
    invocations that</p><p>constitute an atomic action is achieved by a referencing
    specification in conjunction with this Recommendation |</p><p>International Standard.</p><p>This
    Recommendation | International Standard is only applicable to a distributed application
    whose specification</p><p>references this Recommendation | International Standard.</p><p>This
    Recommendation | International Standard does not specify individual implementations
    or products. It does not</p><p>constrain the implementation of entities and interfaces
    within a computer system.</p><p>No requirement is made for conformance to this
    Recommendation | International Standard.</p><p>This Recommendation | International
    Standard includes requirements for compliance that apply to a referencing</p><p>specification.</p><p>The
    CCR service defined in this Recommendation | International Standard requires that
    CCR Protocol Version 2 (or a</p><p>later version) is being used.</p>"
