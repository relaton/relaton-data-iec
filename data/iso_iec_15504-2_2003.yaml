abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 defines the requirements for performing process
    assessment as a basis for use in process improvement and capability determination.</p><p>Process
    assessment is based on a two dimensional model containing a process dimension
    and a capability dimension. The process dimension is provided by an external process
    reference model, which defines a set of processes characterized by statements
    of process purpose and process outcomes. The capability dimension consists of
    a measurement framework comprising six process capability levels and their associated
    process attributes.</p><p>The assessment output consists of a set of process attribute
    ratings for each process assessed, termed the process profile, and may also include
    the capability level achieved by that process.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 identifies
    the measurement framework for process capability and the requirements for:</p><ul><li>performing
    an assessment;</li><li>process reference models;</li><li>process assessment models;</li><li>verifying
    conformity of process assessment.</li></ul><p>The requirements for process assessment
    defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 form a structure which:</p><ul><li>facilitates
    self-assessment;</li><li>provides a basis for use in process improvement and capability
    determination;</li><li>takes into account the context in which the assessed process
    is implemented;</li><li>produces a process rating;</li><li>addresses the ability
    of the process to achieve its purpose;</li><li>is applicable across all application
    domains and sizes of organization; and</li><li>may provide an objective benchmark
    between organizations.</li></ul><p>The minimum set of requirements defined in
    ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 ensures that assessment results are objective, impartial,
    consistent, repeatable and representative of the assessed processes. Results of
    conformant process assessments may be compared when the scopes of the assessments
    are considered to be similar; for guidance on this matter, refer to ISO/IEC 15504-4.</p>"
