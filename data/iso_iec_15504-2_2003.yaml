abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 defines the requirements for performing process assessment
    as a basis for use in process improvement and capability determination.<br /><br
    />\r\nProcess assessment is based on a two dimensional model containing a process
    dimension and a capability dimension. The process dimension is provided by an
    external process reference model, which defines a set of processes characterized
    by statements of process purpose and process outcomes. The capability dimension
    consists of a measurement framework comprising six process capability levels and
    their associated process attributes.<br /><br />\r\nThe assessment output consists
    of a set of process attribute ratings for each process assessed, termed the process
    profile, and may also include the capability level achieved by that process.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 identifies the measurement framework for process
    capability and the requirements for:\r\n\r\n\tperforming an assessment;\r\n\tprocess
    reference models;\r\n\tprocess assessment models;\r\n\tverifying conformity of
    process assessment.<br /><br />\r\nThe requirements for process assessment defined
    in ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 form a structure which:\r\n\r\n\tfacilitates self-assessment;\r\n\tprovides
    a basis for use in process improvement and capability determination;\r\n\ttakes
    into account the context in which the assessed process is implemented;\r\n\tproduces
    a process rating;\r\n\taddresses the ability of the process to achieve its purpose;\r\n\tis
    applicable across all application domains and sizes of organization; and\r\n\tmay
    provide an objective benchmark between organizations.<br /><br />\r\nThe minimum
    set of requirements defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2:2003 ensures that assessment results
    are objective, impartial, consistent, repeatable and representative of the assessed
    processes. Results of conformant process assessments may be compared when the
    scopes of the assessments are considered to be similar; for guidance on this matter,
    refer to ISO/IEC 15504-4."
