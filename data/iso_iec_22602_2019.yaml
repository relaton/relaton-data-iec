abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the description of entities of the real world
    dealing with competencies, competencies description, competencies evaluation,
    and of the operations done by these entities on competencies.<br />\r\nThis document
    provides a model to express all information required for the exchange and integration
    of heterogeneous descriptions of \"competency\" and of heterogeneous \"competency
    objects\":<br />\r\n- any item of discourse in the real world related to \"competency\"
    has a representation preserving its meaning in the proposed model;<br />\r\n-
    this representation allows comparison, hierarchical classification and aggregation
    of different items of discourse related to \"competency\".<br />\r\nThe concrete
    content of items of discourse in the real world related to \"competency\" is not
    specified in this document, which only deals with the formal expression of the
    discourse."
