abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the CMAF multimedia format, which contains segmented
    media objects optimized for streaming delivery and decoding on end user devices
    in adaptive multimedia presentations.<br />\r\nCMAF specifies a track format derived
    from the ISO base media file format, then derives addressable media objects from
    CMAF tracks that can be used for storage and delivery.<br />\r\nCMAF specifies
    sets of tracks that share encoding and packaging constraints that enable the selection
    of multiple tracks to form a multimedia presentation and allow seamless switching
    of alternative encodings of the same content at different bit rates, frame rates,
    resolution, etc.<br />\r\nCMAF specifies a hypothetical application model that
    determines how tracks in a CMAF presentation are intended to be combined and synchronized
    to form a multimedia presentation. The model abstracts delivery to allow any delivery
    method. The hypothetical application model assumes a manifest and player, but
    CMAF does not specify a manifest, player, or delivery protocol, with the intent
    that any that support the hypothetical application model can be used.<br />\r\nCMAF
    specifies media profiles and brands that constrain media encoding and packaging
    of CMAF tracks to enable seamless adaptive switching of tracks and allow devices
    to identify compatible content by its brand.<br />\r\nCMAF specifies presentation
    profiles that conditionally require sets of CMAF tracks conforming to specified
    media profiles and allow content creators and devices to identify compatible multimedia
    presentations.<br />\r\nCMAF enables extensibility by specifying how new media
    profiles and presentation profiles can be specified and identified and includes
    guidelines for those specifications."
