abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    210409:2001 This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between
    \"QSIG\" and \"H.323\" in support of generic functional procedures for supplementary
    services within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).<br />\r\n\"QSIG\"
    is a signalling protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private
    Integrated Services eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN). The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides circuit-switched
    basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other
    Standards, in particular ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services),
    ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services)
    and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services.<br />\r\n\"H.323\"
    is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication
    within a packet network, in particular a packet network that uses the Internet
    Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling protocols
    operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more
    gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint can be a terminal or a gateway to another
    network. H.323 is an \"umbrella\" recommendation, referring to various ITU-T recommendations,
    in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities)
    and Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary
    services).<br />\r\nNOTE - H.450.1 applies to the 1998 version of H.323 (also
    known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.<br />\r\nInterworking between
    QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at
    a user of an IP network, or a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate
    at a user of a PISN. In addition this International Standard enables the participants
    of a call to exchange supplementary service control information in a generic way.
    The more specific aspects of interworking particular supplementary services are
    specified in other Standards.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is applicable
    to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG
    and an IP network employing H.323."
