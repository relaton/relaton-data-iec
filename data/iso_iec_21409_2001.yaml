abstract:
- content: <p>This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between
    "QSIG" and "H.323" in support of generic functional</p><p>procedures for supplementary
    services within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).</p><p>"QSIG" is a
    signalling protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated
    Services eXchanges (PINX)</p><p>within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).
    The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides</p><p>circuit-switched
    basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other
    Standards, in particular</p><p>ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic
    services), ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of</p><p>supplementary
    services) and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services.</p><p>"H.323"
    is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication
    within a packet network, in</p><p>particular a packet network that uses the Internet
    Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling</p><p>protocols
    operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more
    gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint</p><p>can be a terminal or a gateway to
    another network. H.323 is an "umbrella" recommendation, referring to various ITU-T</p><p>recommendations,
    in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities)
    and</p><p>Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support
    of supplementary services).</p><p>NOTE - H.450.1 applies to the 1998 version of
    H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.</p><p>Interworking
    between QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate
    at a user of an IP network, or</p><p>a call originating at a user of an IP network
    to terminate at a user of a PISN. In addition this International Standard enables
    the</p><p>participants of a call to exchange supplementary service control information
    in a generic way. The more specific aspects of</p><p>interworking particular supplementary
    services are specified in other Standards.</p><p>This International Standard is
    applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing
    QSIG</p><p>and an IP network employing H.323.</p>
