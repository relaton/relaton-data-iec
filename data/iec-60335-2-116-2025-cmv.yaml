  content: "IEC 60335-2-116:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-116:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC
    60335-2-116:2019 edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are
    provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any
    part of the content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-116:2025 deals with the safety
    of furniture with electrically motorized parts intended for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current
    (DC) supplied furniture and battery-operated furniture.<br />\r\nFurniture incorporating
    electrically motorized parts not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as furniture intended to be used
    by laymen in shops, offices, hotels, restaurants, cinemas, hospitals, schools,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nExamples
    of furniture incorporating electrically motorized parts, are<br />\r\n– electrically
    operated/height adjustable tables and desks;<br />\r\n– electrically operated/adjustable
    stands and wall attachment for e.g.TV sets and monitors;<br />\r\n– electrically
    operated/adjustable seating;<br />\r\n– beds with incorporated ventilators and
    filters;<br />\r\n– electrically operated/adjustable beds;<br />\r\n– electrically
    operated/adjustable storage units including kitchen units;<br />\r\n– electrically
    operated/adjustable furniture intended to be secured to the wall or ceiling;<br
    />\r\n– electrically operated extension elements (drawers and doors);<br />\r\n–
    electric check-out furniture in hotels and shops;<br />\r\n– furniture delivered
    in parts (ready to assemble or knock-down furniture).<br />\r\nThis standard deals
    with the reasonably foreseeable hazards presented by furniture incorporating electrically
    motorized parts that are encountered by all persons. However, in general, it does
    not take into account<br />\r\n– persons whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the furniture incorporating
    electric appliances, parts or components safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n– children playing with furniture incorporating electrically motorized parts.<br
    />\r\nAdditional requirements can be necessary for furniture incorporating electrically
    motorized parts intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft.
    In many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national authorities for fire protection and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– furniture containing heating elements;<br
    />\r\n– furniture intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– massage beds and massage chairs (IEC 60335-2-32);<br />\r\n– medical electrical
    equipment (IEC 60601 series);<br />\r\n– audio/video, information and communication
    technology equipment (IEC 62368-1);<br />\r\n– electrical wheel chairs;<br />\r\n–
    special furniture incorporating electric appliances, parts or components, which
    are part of industrial production equipment;<br />\r\n– electric child care articles
    except electrical height adjustable changing (nursing) tables;<br />\r\n– furniture
    especially for use by children;<br />\r\n– furniture for outdoor use.<br />\r\nMassage
    beds and massage chairs with motorized parts, other than those performing the
    massaging function, are also evaluated to the applicable requirements of this
    standard.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion or conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) introduction of surface temperature
    limits (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\nd) introduction of test probe 19 (8.1.1, 20.2);<br
    />\r\ne) revision of Clause 20.2.105 with a new entrapment force test method,
    including time-force profiles and updated force limits.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is
    to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
