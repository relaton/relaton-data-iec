  content: IEC 63010-1:2017(E) applies to cables with insulation and sheaths based
    on halogen-free thermoplastic compounds for use with small devices and for short
    connections to desktop electrical appliances where flexibility is of prime importance.
    These cables have a voltage rating <em>U<sub>0</sub>/U</em> up to and including
    300/300 V. Maximum operating temperature for the cables in this document is 70°C.
