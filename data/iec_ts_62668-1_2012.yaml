abstract:
- content: |-
    IEC/TS 62668-1:2012(E) defines requirements for avoiding the use of counterfeit, recycled and fraudulent components used in the aerospace, defence and high performance (ADHP) industries. It also defines requirements for ADHP industries to maintain their intellectual property (IP) for all of their products and services. The risks associated with purchasing components outside of franchised distributor networks will be considered in IEC/TS 62668-2 which is to be published in the near future. Although developed for the avionics industry, this specification may be applied by other high performance and high reliability industries at their discretion.
    Keywords: avionics, counterfeit, fraudulent.
