abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 62913-2-4:2019(E) initiates and illustrates the IEC's systems
    approach based on Use Cases and involving the identification of generic smart
    grid requirements for further standardization work for the electric transportation
    domain, based on the methods and tools developed in IEC SRD 62913-1.<br />\r\nThis
    document captures possible \"common and repeated usage\" of a smart grid system,
    under the format of \"Use Cases\" with a view to feeding further standardization
    activities. Use Cases can be described in different ways and can represent competing
    alternatives. From there, this document derives the common requirements to be
    considered by these further standardization activities in terms of interfaces
    between actors interacting with the given system.<br />\r\nTo this end, Use Case
    implementations are given for information purposes only. The interface requirements
    to be considered for later standardization activities are summarized (typically
    information pieces, communication services and specific non-functional requirements:
    performance level, security specification, etc.).<br />\r\nThis analysis is based
    on the business input from domain experts as well as existing material on electric
    transportation in a smart grid environment when relevant."
