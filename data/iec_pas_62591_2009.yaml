abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 62591:2009(E) specifies the procedures for the transfer of data
    and control information from one Data-Link user entity to another user entity
    or many, and among the Data-Link entities forming the distributed datalink service
    provider as well as the structure of the fieldbus DLPDUs used for the transfer
    of data and control information by the protocol of this publication, and their
    representation as physical interface data units. The procedures are defined in
    terms of the interactions between DL-entities (DLEs) through the exchange of fieldbus
    DLPDUs; the interactions between a DL-service (DLS) provider and a DLS-user in
    the same system through the exchange of DLS primitives; the interactions between
    a DLS-provider and a Ph-service provider in the same system through the exchange
    of Ph-service primitives.
