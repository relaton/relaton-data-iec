    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60358-1:2025
    This part of IEC 60358 applies to:<br />\r\nCoupling capacitors and capacitor
    dividers, with rated voltage > 1 000 V, connected line to ground with the low-voltage
    terminal either permanently earthed or connected to devices, for applications
    listed hereunder and other similar uses.<br />\r\nThis document serves as a basic
    standard for the coupling capacitors and capacitor dividers."
