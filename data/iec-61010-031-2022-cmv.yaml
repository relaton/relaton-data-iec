  content: "IEC 61010-031:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61010-031:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61010-031:2015+AMD1:2018
    CSV edition 2.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 66 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61010-031:2022 specifies safety requirements for
    hand-held and hand-manipulated probe assemblies for electrical test and measurement,
    and their related accessories. These probe assemblies are for non-contact or direct
    electrical connection between a part and electrical test and measurement equipment.
    They can be fixed to the equipment or be detachable accessories for the equipment.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2015, and Amendment 1:2018. IEC 61010-031 is a
    stand-alone standard. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">the scope has been made succinct. General information
    from the scope of Edition 2 has been moved to a new Clause 4. Consequently, Clause
    4 to Clause 8 of Edition 2 have been renumbered. Clause 9 of Edition 2 has been
    deleted;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in Clause 2, normative references
    have been dated and new normative references have been added;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in
    3.1.4, the definition of probe tip has been modified;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in
    4.1, there is no longer any differentiation between high voltage and low voltage
    probe assemblies. Type C probe assemblies have been merged with Type B probe assemblies;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">in 4.1 d) \"Kelvin\" probes have been added to the
    list of probe assemblies as a new Type E and a new Figure 5;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in
    4.1 e), probes for voltage measurement without electrical connection to conductors
    have been added to the list of probe assemblies as a new Type F and a new Figure
    6;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in 4.2.1, spread of fire is no longer
    considered as a hazard;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Subclause 4.4.2.5
    from Edition 2 has been deleted;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Subclause
    4.4.4.3 from Edition 2 has been deleted;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\"
    value=\"10\">in 5.4.4.1 consideration has been given to spacings and impedance;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">in 6.1.1, removable parts of probe tips which bear
    markings are allowed;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in 6.1.5, the
    voltage to be marked for measurement categories is the AC line-to-neutral or DC
    voltage;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in 7.4.2, requirements for
    unmated connectors have been modified as follows:\r\n\t<ol>\r\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Table
    2 has been modified and expanded,</li>\r\n\t\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">a
    calculation method for clearances of connectors above 20 kV has been defined,</li>\r\n\t\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">creepage distances have been aligned with clearances;</li>\r\n\t</ol>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\" value=\"14\">in 7.4.3.1 and 7.4.3.5, requirements
    for IP2X probe tips with retractable sleeve have been added;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">in
    7.4.3.2, Probe tips are now applicable to non-contact probe assemblies;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">in 7.5.2.3.2, the values of Table 5 have been modified;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">in 7.6.2, voltage tests of clearances are done without
    humidity preconditioning;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">pre-treatments
    for rigidity test from Clause 10 of Edition 2 have been moved to 9.2;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">Subclause 11.1 of Edition 2 has been deleted;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">addition of an exception for Type E probe assembly
    in 13.2. Removable parts of probe tips which bear markings are allowed;</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">Figure F.1 has been modified;</li>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">Annex
    G has been added, for determination of clearances for Table 2<strong>;</strong></li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">Annex H has been added, covering line-to-neutral
    voltages for common mains supply systems.</li>\r\n</ol>"
