  content: "IEC TR 63179-1:2020 (E) provides guidelines for the selection of a high-voltage
    directive current (HVDC) system with line-commutated converters (LCC), hereafter
    referred to as HVDC system, for the purposes of HVDC system planning. It covers
    the guidelines on the requirements for integrating HVDC systems in AC power networks,
    selection of rated voltage and power, overloads, circuit configuration, expandability,
    comparison of technical, economic, regulatory, political, social and environmental
    factors, etc.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable for planning an HVDC system.
    This guideline is not exhaustive and it is possible that there will be other specific
    aspects, particular to a specific HVDC project, which will also need to be considered."
