abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19794-2:2011 specifies a concept and data formats for representation
    of fingerprints using the fundamental notion of minutiae. It is generic, in that
    it may be applied and used in a wide range of application areas where automated
    fingerprint recognition is involved. It contains definitions of relevant terms,
    a description of how minutiae are to be determined, data formats for containing
    the data for both general use and for use with cards, and conformance information.
    Guidelines and values for matching and decision parameters are provided.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19794-2:2011 specifies the following:</p><ul><li>the fundamental data elements
    used for minutiae-based representation of a fingerprint;</li><li>three data formats
    for interchange and storage of this data: a record-based format, and normal and
    compact formats for use on a smart card in a match-on-card application;</li><li>optional
    extended data formats for including additional data such as ridge counts and core
    and delta location.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 19794-2:2011 provides for interchange
    of finger minutiae data between sensing, storage and matching systems.</p>"
