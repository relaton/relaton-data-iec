abstract:
- content: A Very Small Entity (VSE) is defined as an enterprise, organization, department
    or project having up to 25 people. A set of standards and guides have been developed
    according to a set of VSEs' characteristics and needs. The guides are based on
    subsets of appropriate standards elements, referred to as VSE profiles. The purpose
    of a VSE profile is to define a subset of International Standards relevant to
    the VSE context. ISO/IEC 29110 is targeted by audience. ISO/IEC 29110-2:2011 is
    targeted for standards producers, tool vendors and methodology vendors. It is
    not intended for VSEs. It introduces the concepts for software engineering International
    Standardized Profiles for VSEs, and defines the terms common to ISO/IEC 29110.
    It establishes the logic behind the definition and application of standardized
    profiles. It specifies the elements common to all standardized profiles (structure,
    conformance, assessment) and introduces the taxonomy (catalogue) of ISO/IEC 29110
    profiles.
