    <p>This Technical Report presents the framework and recommended model for internationalization and identifies the Services required for the internationalization of information technology. </p>
    <p>This Technical Report: </p>
    <p>- discusses the requirements of internationalized Systems and their users,</p>
    <p>- suggests a concerted, unified approach to internationalization,</p>
    <p>- recommends Services to fulfil the requirements, and lists the Standards related to the Services. </p>
    <p>This Technical Report is intended to be a reference for future Standards on the internationalization of information technology, to act as a communication vehicle between those who provide Standards and those who request them, and also to function as a basis for all future ISO/IEC JTC l/SC 22NVG 20 activities. </p>
    <p>NOTE 1 This Technical Report does not propose any specific solutions for internationalization. Future Standards are expected to provide the solutions, reflecting the directions in this Technical Report. </p>
    <p>NOTE 2 Internationalization Services consist of internationally generic Services and nationally specific information (data). This Technical Report covers only the internationally generic Portion of Software, so it does not discuss: - preparation of internationalized information technology Systems for localization by a local User. - hardware-related issues or requirements. - requirements related to System ergonomics.</p>
    <p> NOTE 3 The internationalization solutions and Services available in the mid-late 1980s are the technical basis for this Technical Report.</p>
