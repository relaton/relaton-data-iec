    <p>Today multi-screen/second-screen solutions are proliferating. However, each is a proprietary vertical for particular vendor(s). Therefore users expectations aren't being met:</p>
    <p>-           Seamless interoperability across vendors.</p>
    <p>-           Ability for second screen integrated usages rather than 100s of different apps.</p>
    <p>The UPnP Multi-Screen Device Control Protocols (DCPs) provide an open interface to enable this interoperability between devices and applications, i.e. enable time-sensitive and interactive services, including implementation-specific applications, among various display devices.  </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-28-1:2017 describes the overall Multi-Screen Architecture, which forms the foundation for the UPnP Multi-Screen Device and Service templates. The Multi-Screen Architecture defines the general interaction between UPnP control points and UPnP devices defined by the UPnP Multi-Screen DCPs.</p>
