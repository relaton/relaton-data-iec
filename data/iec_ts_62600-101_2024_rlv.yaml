abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62600-101:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC TS 62600-101:2024 establishes
    a system for estimating, analysing and reporting the wave energy resource at sites
    potentially suitable for the installation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs). This
    document is to be applied at all stages of site assessment, from initial investigations
    to detailed project design. This document is to be applied in conjunction with
    the IEC Technical Specification on WEC performance (IEC TS 62600-100) to estimate
    the mean annual energy production of a WEC or WEC array as described in the methodology
    in Annex A. This document is not intended for estimation of extreme wave conditions.
    The framework and methodologies prescribed in this document are intended to ensure
    that only adequate models are used, and that they are applied in an appropriate
    manner to ensure confidence and consistency in the reported results. Moreover,
    the document prescribes methods for analysing metocean data (including the data
    generated by modelling) in order to properly quantify and characterize the temporal
    and spatial attributes of the wave energy resource, and for reporting the results
    of a resource assessment in a comprehensive and consistent manner.</p>
