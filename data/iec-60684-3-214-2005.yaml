  content: 'This standard gives the requirements for two types of heat-shrinkable,
    not flame retarded, polyolefin sleeving with a nominal shrink ratio of 3:1 and
    with thick and medium wall. This sleeving has been found suitable at temperatures
    up to 135 °C. - Type A: Medium wall - internal diameter of upt to 180,0 mm.  -
    Type B: Thick wall - internal diameter of up to 160,0 mm.'
