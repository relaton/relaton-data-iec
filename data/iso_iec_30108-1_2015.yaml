abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 30108-1:2015 defines the architecture, operations, data elements,
    and basic requirements for biometric identity assurance services - a framework
    for the implementation of generic, biometric-based identity services within a
    services-oriented environment. An identity in the context of BIAS comprises a
    subject, biographic data, and biometric data. Other parts are intended to define
    specific BIAS implementations (or bindings) within specific environments, for
    example, SOAP web services.<p>BIAS services are generic in nature, being modality
    neutral, and not targeted at any particular business application. These services
    include those related to identity data management, transformation, and biometric
    comparison. Services are invoked by a BIAS requester and implemented by a BIAS
    service provider (responder). It does not prescribe the architecture or business
    logic of either the requester or service provider.</p><p>Two categories of identity
    services are defined - primitive and aggregate. Primitive services are more atomic
    and well-defined, whereas the aggregate services tend to be higher level and enable
    more flexibility on the part of the BIAS service provider.</p><p>Two identity
    models are also defined: person-centric and encounter-based. Person-centric systems
    maintain a single up-to-date record (set of data) for a given subject, whereas
    an encounter-based system retains data related to each interaction the subject
    has with the system.</p><p>ISO/IEC 30108-1:2015 represents a version of BIAS subsequent
    to that previously standardized by INCITS and OASIS, therefore, it is denoted
    as version 2.0.</p>'
