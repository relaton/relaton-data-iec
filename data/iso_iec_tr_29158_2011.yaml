abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29158:2011 is an engineering document intended for verifier
    manufacturers and application specification developers.<br /><br />\r\nIt describes
    modifications which are to be considered in conjunction with the symbol quality
    methodology defined in ISO/IEC 15415 and a symbology specification. It defines
    alternative illumination conditions, some new terms and parameters, modifications
    to the measurement and grading of certain parameters, and the reporting of the
    grading results.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29158:2011 was developed to assess
    the symbol quality of direct marked parts, where the mark is applied directly
    to the surface of the item and the reading device is a two-dimensional imager.<br
    /><br />\r\nWhen application specifications allow, this method may also be applied
    to symbols produced by other methods. This is appropriate when direct part marked
    (DPM) symbols and non-DPM symbols are being scanned in the same scanning environment.
    The symbol grade is reported as a DPM grade rather than as an ISO/IEC 15415 grade."
