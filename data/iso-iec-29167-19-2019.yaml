    <p>This document defines the Rabin-Montgomery (RAMON) crypto suite for the ISO/IEC 18000 series of air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices that can be referred to by ISO/IEC for air interface standards and application standards.</p>
    <p>This document specifies a crypto suite for Rabin-Montgomery (RAMON) for air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.</p>
    <p>This document defines various authentication methods and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag and an Interrogator can support one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported.</p>
