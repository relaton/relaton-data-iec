abstract:
- content: "IEC 60479-2:2019 describes the effects on the human body when a sinusoidal
    alternating current in the frequency range above 100 Hz passes through it.<br
    />\r\nThe effects of current passing through the human body for:<br />\r\n– alternating
    sinusoidal current with DC components,<br />\r\n– alternating sinusoidal current
    with phase control, and<br />\r\n– alternating sinusoidal current with multicycle
    control<br />\r\nare given but are only deemed applicable for alternating current
    frequencies from 15 Hz up to 100 Hz.<br />\r\nMeans of extending the frequency
    of applicability of pure sinusoids to a frequency of 150 kHz are given and means
    of examining random complex irregular waveforms are given.<br />\r\nThis document
    describes the effects of current passing through the human body in the form of
    single and multiple successive unidirectional rectangular impulses, sinusoidal
    impulses and impulses resulting from capacitor discharges. The values specified
    are deemed to be applicable for impulse durations from 0,1 ms up to and including
    10 ms.<br />\r\nThis document only considers conducted current resulting from
    the direct application of a source of current to the body, as does IEC 60479-1.
    It does not consider current induced within the body caused by its exposure to
    an external electromagnetic field.<br />\r\nThis basic safety publication is primarily
    intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards in accordance
    with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. It is not
    intended for use by manufacturers or certification bodies. One of the responsibilities
    of a technical committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety
    publications in the preparation of its publications. The requirements, test methods
    or test conditions of this basic safety publication will not apply unless specifically
    referred to or included in the relevant publications.<br />\r\nThis first edition
    cancels and replaces IEC TS 60479-2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to IEC TS 60479 2:2017:<br />\r\na) change in status from Technical Specification
    to International Standard."
