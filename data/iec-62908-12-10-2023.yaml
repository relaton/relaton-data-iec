  content: "IEC 62908-12-10:2023 specifies the standard measuring conditions and measurement
    methods for determining touch and hovering performance of a touch sensor module.
    This document is applicable to touch sensor modules, where the structural relationship
    between touch sensor, touch controller, touch sensor module, display panel, touch
    display panel, and touch display module is defined in IEC 62908-1-2. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- added hovering
    performance measurement methods, especially in-plane characteristics at a constant
    distance from the touch sensor;<br />\r\n- added pen touch performance."
