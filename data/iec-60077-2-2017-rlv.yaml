  content: "IEC 60077-2:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60077-2:2017
    provides general rules for all electrotechnical components installed in power
    circuits, auxiliary circuits, control and indicating circuits, etc., on railway
    rolling stock. The purpose of this document is to adapt the general rules given
    in IEC 60077-1 to all electrotechnical components for rolling stock, in order
    to obtain uniformity of requirements and tests for the corresponding range of
    components. This new edition includes the following main technical changes with
    regard to the previous edition: short circuit breaking capacity; rated short-time
    withstand current; critical currents range; specification of climatic conditions.
    This standard is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60077-1:2017."
