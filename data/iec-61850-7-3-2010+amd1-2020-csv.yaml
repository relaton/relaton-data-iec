  content: "IEC 61850-7-3:2010+A1:2020 is applicable to the description of device
    models and functions of substations and feeder equipment. It specifies constructed
    attribute classes and common data classes related to substation applications.
    In particular, it specifies common data classes for status information, common
    data classes for measured information, common data classes for control, common
    data classes for status settings, common data classes for analogue settings and
    attribute types used in these common data classes. This second edition defines
    new common data classes used for new standards defining object models for other
    domains based on IEC 61850 and for the representation of statistical and historical
    data.<br />\r\nThis publication is of core relevance for Smart Grid. This consolidated
    version consists of the second edition (2010) and its amendment 1 (2020). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication."
