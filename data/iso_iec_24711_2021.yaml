abstract:
- content: "<p>The scope of this document is limited to the evaluation of ink cartridge
    page yield for ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated ink cartridges and ink
    cartridges without integrated printheads) for colour inkjet print systems. This
    document can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device
    that has a digital input printing path, including multi-function devices that
    contain inkjet printer components. Both liquid and solid ink products can be tested
    using this document.</p><p>This document is only intended for the measurement
    of ink cartridge page yield when printing on plain paper. No other claims can
    be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p><p>This document
    can be used to measure the yield of any cartridge that is used in a significant
    amount during the printing of the test page suite defined in ISO/IEC 24712.</p><p>This
    document is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to
    or greater than A3 or for printers designed or configured to print photos (for
    example, maximum printable size less than A4 or a printer configuration intended
    for photo-only printing). In addition, it only applies to drop-on-demand printing
    systems.</p><p>NOTE Integrated ink cartridges is a cartridge that includes at
    least: an ink containment part, an ink deposition mechanism and an ink transport
    part (see ISO/IEC 29142-1).</p>"
