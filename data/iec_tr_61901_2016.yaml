abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61901:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, specifies test methods
    and requirements for power cable systems, cables with extruded insulation and
    their accessories for fixed installations, for rated voltages above 30 kV (U<sub>m</sub>
    = 36 kV) up to and including 500 kV (U<sub>m</sub> = 550 kV). The requirements
    apply to single-core cables and to their accessories for usual conditions of installation
    and operation, but not to special cables and their accessories, such as submarine
    cables, for which modifications to the tests may be necessary or special test
    conditions may need to be devised. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Recommendations
    on the tests to be performed at the different stages of the cable and cable system
    qualification (development tests, type tests, sample tests, routine tests, after
    installation tests) have been provided;<br />\r\nb) The performance level of the
    tests related to the longitudinally applied metal foil which depends on the cable
    design has been detailed;<br />\r\nc) Three cable designs that represent the world
    production of cables with longitudinally applied metal foil have been detailed;<br
    />\r\nd) A test on the weld design has been included, following the appearance
    of a new cable design with smooth and longitudinally welded aluminium foil (referred
    to in this document as combined design);<br />\r\ne) An examination of the cable
    at the end of the type test has been included;<br />\r\nf) The cable system approach
    (cable with installed accessories) has been considered and a short circuit test
    with accessories has been introduced."
