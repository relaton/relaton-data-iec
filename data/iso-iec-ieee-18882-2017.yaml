  content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 18882:2017 is based on the protocol defined in IEEE Std
    1888?1, IEEE Standard for Ubiquitous Green Community Control Network Protocol,
    this standard extends component and data type definitions, message formats, and
    communication procedures for heterogeneous network convergence and scalability.
    This standard also describes heterogeneous networks interconnection issues and
    requirements. Also, this standard specifies system architecture and solutions
    to improve heterogeneous networks convergence and scalability while offering system
    robustness and supplying better performance in system operation and management.</p>"
