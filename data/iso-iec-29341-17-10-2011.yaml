  content: ISO/IEC 29341-17-10:2011(E) describes the service definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.[DEVICE]. This service-type enables
    modeling of the 'QosDevice' function capabilities. The QosDevice:3 Service is
    a function typically implemented in source, sink and intermediate network. The
    QosDevice Service is responsible for providing the appropriate network resources
    to traffic streams and information about the state of the device as requested
    by the QosManager as defined in the QosManager:3 Service.
