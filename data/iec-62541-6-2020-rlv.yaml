  content: "IEC 62541-6:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and

    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62541-6:2020 specifies
    the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) mapping between the security model described
    in IEC TR 62541-2, the abstract service definitions specified in IEC 62541-4,
    the data structures defined in IEC 62541-5 and the physical network protocols
    that can be used to implement the OPC UA specification. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Encodings:<br />\r\n•
