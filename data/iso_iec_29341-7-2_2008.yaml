abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29341-7-2:2008(E) describes the functionalities of switching the
    light source on or off, changing the intensity of the light source and gives a
    definition of interaction between switch power and dimming service. The series
    of ISO/IEC 29341 publications defines an architecture for pervasive peer-to-peer
    network connectivity of intelligent appliances, wireless devices and PCs. It is
    designed to bring easy to use, flexible, standards-based connectivity to ad-hoc
    or unmanaged networks whether in the home, in a small business, public spaces
    or attached to the Internet.
