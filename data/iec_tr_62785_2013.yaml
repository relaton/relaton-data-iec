- content: "IEC/TR 62785:2013(E) reiterates all the key normative \"shall\" texts
    included in IEC 62430 that specify requirements and procedures to integrate environmental
    aspects into the design and development processes of electrical and electronic
    products, including combinations of products, and the materials and components
    of which they are composed. This report also conveys information on the experiences
    and best practices of environmental consciousness of fibre optics related products
    and subsystems. Key words: environmentally conscious design of fibre optics related
    products and subsystems<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 62430:2009."
