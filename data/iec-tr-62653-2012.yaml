  content: IEC 62653:2012(E) which is a technical report, describes the technical
    requirements for use of equipment in haemodialysis, haemofiltration and haemodiafiltration.
    These principles should be complied with to ensure safe, permissible and proper
    application. The physician is responsible for the haemodialysis treatment prescription.
    However, the organization administering the treatment is responsible for all resources,
    structures and processes used in connection with the treatment. These responsibilities
    will not be described here. If applicable, the scope may be applicable to the
    use of the equipment in paediatrics, home haemodialysis, acute and sorbent dialysis
    systems. This technical report is not intended to be used as the basis of regulatory
    inspection or certification assessment activities.
