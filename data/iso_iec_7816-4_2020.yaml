abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is intended to be used in any sector of activity. It
    specifies:</p><p>— contents of command-response pairs exchanged at the interface,</p><p>—
    means of retrieval of data elements and data objects in the card,</p><p>— structures
    and contents of historical bytes to describe operating characteristics of the
    card,</p><p>— structures for applications and data in the card, as seen at the
    interface when processing commands,</p><p>— access methods to files and data in
    the card,</p><p>— a security architecture defining access rights to files and
    data in the card,</p><p>— means and mechanisms for identifying and addressing
    applications in the card,</p><p>— methods for secure messaging,</p><p>— access
    methods to the algorithms processed by the card. It does not describe these algorithms.</p><p>It
    does not cover the internal implementation within the card or the outside world.</p><p>This
    document is independent from the physical interface technology. It applies to
    cards accessed by one or more of the following methods: contacts, close coupling
    and radio frequency. If the card supports simultaneous use of more than one physical
    interface, the relationship between what happens on different physical interfaces
    is out of the scope of this document.</p>"
