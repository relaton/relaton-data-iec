    <p>This document establishes interface specifications for the implementation of a driving licence in association with a mobile device. This document specifies the interface between the mDL and mDL reader and the interface between the mDL reader and the issuing authority infrastructure. This document also enables parties other than the issuing authority (e.g. other issuing authorities, or mDL verifiers in other countries) to:</p>
    <p>—    use a machine to obtain the mDL data;</p>
    <p>—    tie the mDL to the mDL holder;</p>
    <p>—    authenticate the origin of the mDL data;</p>
    <p>—    verify the integrity of the mDL data.</p>
    <p>The following items are out of scope for this document:</p>
    <p>—    how mDL holder consent to share data is obtained;</p>
    <p>—    requirements on storage of mDL data and mDL private keys.</p>
