abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-24:2020 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-24:2020 edition 8.0 and the previous edition
    IEC 60335-2-24:2010+AMD1:2012+AMD2:2017 CSV edition 7.2. Futhermore, comments
    from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant
    changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-24:2020 deals with the safety of the following
    appliances, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances,
    480 V for other appliances and 24 V DC for appliances when battery operated:<br
    />\r\n– refrigerating appliances for household and similar use;<br />\r\n– ice-makers
    incorporating a motor-compressor and ice-makers intended to be incorporated in
    frozen food storage compartments;<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances and ice-makers
    for use in camping, touring caravans and boats for leisure purposes.<br />\r\nThese
    appliances may be operated from the mains, from a separate battery or operated
    either from the mains or from a separate battery.<br />\r\nThis standard also
    deals with the safety of ice-cream appliances intended for household use, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V
    for other appliances.<br />\r\nIt also deals with compression-type appliances
    for household and similar use, which use flammable refrigerants.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not cover features of the construction and operation of those refrigerating
    appliances which are dealt with in other IEC standards.<br />\r\nRefrigerating
    appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be
    a source of danger to the public, such as<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances
    used in staff kitchen areas in shops, offices and other working environments,<br
    />\r\n– refrigerating appliances used in farm houses and by clients in hotels,
    motels and other residential type environments,<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances
    used in bed and breakfast type environments, and<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances
    used in catering and similar non-retail applications<br />\r\nare within the scope
    of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection
    of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in the open
    air;<br />\r\n– appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n–
    appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br
    />\r\n– appliances incorporating a battery intended as a power supply for the
    refrigerating function;<br />\r\n– appliances assembled on site by the installer;<br
    />\r\n– appliances with remote motor-compressors;<br />\r\n– motor-compressors
    (IEC 60335-2-34);<br />\r\n– commercial dispensing appliances and vending appliances
    (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n– commercial refrigerating appliances and ice-makers
    with an incorporated or remote refrigerant unit or motor-compressor (IEC 60335-2-89);<br
    />\r\n– professional ice-cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118).<br /><br />\r\nThis eighth
    edition cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in 2010, Amendment
    1:2012 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n– aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5.2;<br
    />\r\n– some notes have been converted to normative text or deleted (4, 5.2, 5.7,
    7.1, 7.6, 7.10, 7.12, 19.1, 19.101, 19.102, 20.101, 20.102, 20.103, 20.104, 21,
    22.7, 22.33, 22.101, 22.102, 22.103, 22.107, 22.108, 22.109, 30.1);<br />\r\n–
    normative references and associated text have been updated (2, 22.108, 22.109,
    Table 102, Annex CC);<br />\r\n– definition of free space has been clarified (3.6.104);<br
    />\r\n– measurement of the input current of refrigerating appliances using inverter
    driven motor-compressors is included (10.2);<br />\r\n– compatibility tests for
    winding insulation of motor-compressors used with different types of refrigerants
    and oils have been introduced (22.9);<br />\r\n– requirements for inadvertent
    contact points between uncoated aluminium pipes and copper pipes have been updated
    (22.111);<br />\r\n– testing of accessible glass panels has been clarified (22.116);<br
    />\r\n– in refrigerating appliances, requirements for material encasing and in
    contact with thermal insulation have been introduced and consequential text has
    been deleted (22.117, 30.2, 30.2.101, Annex EE);<br />\r\n– requirements for motor
    running capacitors have been updated (24.5, 24.8);<br />\r\n– the locked rotor
    test for fan motors has been clarified (Annex AA).<p>This part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was
    established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard.<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of August 2021 have been included in this copy.</p>"
