abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17341:2009 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of 120 mm rewritable optical disks with capacities of 4,7 Gbytes and 9,4 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many times
    using the phase change method. These disks are identified as +RW.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    17341:2009 also specifies 80 mm disks with capacities of 1,46 Gbytes and 2,92
    Gbytes. These disks have the same characteristics as the 120 mm disks, except
    for some parameters related to the smaller dimensions. All parameters unique for
    the 80 mm disks are specified in an annex.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17341:2009 specifies
    the following:</p><ul><li>two related but different types of this disk;</li><li>the
    conditions for conformance;</li><li>the environments in which the disk is to be
    tested, operated and stored;</li><li>the mechanical, physical and dimensional
    characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data
    processing systems;</li><li>the format of the information on the disk, including
    the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes
    and the coding method;</li><li>the characteristics of the signals recorded on
    the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to read the data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    17341:2009 provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives.
    Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data
    interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
