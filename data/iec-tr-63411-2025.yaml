  content: IEC TR 63411:2025 discusses the challenges of connecting offshore wind
    farms via VSC-HVDC, key technical issues and emerging technologies. The potential
    solutions include new technologies, methods and practices to provide more flexibility
    and improve the efficiency of power systems. The primary objective of this document
    is to provide a comprehensive overview of challenges, potential solutions, and
    emerging technologies for grid integration of large-scale offshore wind farms
    via VSC-HVDC. It is expected that this document can also provide guidance for
    further standardization on relevant issues. The purpose of this document is not
    intended to hinder any further development of state-of-art technologies in this
    field. This Technical report is not an exhaustive document in itself to specify
    any scope of work or similar, between a purchaser and a supplier, for any contractual
    delivery of a HVDC project/equipment. It is expected that this document is used
    for pre-study and then to make studies, specification for delivery of specific
    HVDC project, as applicable.
