abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the syntax and semantics of COBOL. Its purpose
    is to promote a high degree of machine independence to permit the use of COBOL
    on a variety of data processing systems.</p><p>This document specifies:</p><ul><li>The
    form of a compilation group written in COBOL.</li><li>The effect of compiling
    a compilation group.</li><li> The effect of executing run units.</li><li>The elements
    of the language for which a conforming implementation is required to supply a
    definition.</li><li>The elements of the language for which meaning is explicitly
    undefined.</li><li>The elements of the language that are dependent on the capabilities
    of the processor.</li></ul><p>This document does not specify:</p><ul><li>The means
    whereby a compilation group written in COBOL is compiled into code executable
    by a processor.</li><li>The time at which method, function, or program runtime
    modules are linked or bound to an activating statement, except that runtime binding
    occurs of necessity when the identification of the appropriate program or method
    is not known at compile time.</li><li>The time at which parameterized classes
    and interfaces are expanded.</li><li>The mechanism by which locales are defined
    and made available on a processor.</li><li>The form or content of error, flagging,
    or warning messages.</li><li>The form and content of listings produced during
    compilation, if any.</li><li>The form of documentation produced by an implementor
    of products conforming to this document.</li><li>The sharing of objects and resources
    other than files among run units.</li></ul>"
