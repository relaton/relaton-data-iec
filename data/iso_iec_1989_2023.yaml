abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 1989:2023 This document specifies the syntax and semantics of
    COBOL. Its purpose is to promote a high degree of machine independence to permit
    the use of COBOL on a variety of data processing systems.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies:<br />\r\nThe form of a compilation group written in COBOL.<br />\r\nThe
    effect of compiling a compilation group.<br />\r\nThe effect of executing run
    units.<br />\r\nThe elements of the language for which a conforming implementation
    is required to supply a definition.<br />\r\nThe elements of the language for
    which meaning is explicitly undefined.<br />\r\nThe elements of the language that
    are dependent on the capabilities of the processor.<br />\r\nThis document does
    not specify:<br />\r\nThe means whereby a compilation group written in COBOL is
    compiled into code executable by a processor.<br />\r\nThe time at which method,
    function, or program runtime modules are linked or bound to an activating statement,
    except that runtime binding occurs of necessity when the identification of the
    appropriate program or method is not known at compile time.<br />\r\nThe time
    at which parameterized classes and interfaces are expanded.<br />\r\nThe mechanism
    by which locales are defined and made available on a processor.<br />\r\nThe form
    or content of error, flagging, or warning messages.<br />\r\nThe form and content
    of listings produced during compilation, if any.<br />\r\nThe form of documentation
    produced by an implementor of products conforming to this document.<br />\r\nThe
    sharing of objects and resources other than files among run units."
