abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 1989:2023 This document specifies the syntax and semantics of
    COBOL. Its purpose is to promote a high degree of machine independence to permit
    the use of COBOL on a variety of data processing systems.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies:\r\n \r\n\t The form of a compilation group written in COBOL. \r\n\t
    The effect of compiling a compilation group. \r\n\t The effect of executing run
    units. \r\n\t The elements of the language for which a conforming implementation
    is required to supply a definition. \r\n\t The elements of the language for which
    meaning is explicitly undefined. \r\n\t The elements of the language that are
    dependent on the capabilities of the processor. \r\n \r\nThis document does not
    specify:\r\n\r\n \r\n\t The means whereby a compilation group written in COBOL
    is compiled into code executable by a processor. \r\n\t The time at which method,
    function, or program runtime modules are linked or bound to an activating statement,
    except that runtime binding occurs of necessity when the identification of the
    appropriate program or method is not known at compile time. \r\n\t The time at
    which parameterized classes and interfaces are expanded. \r\n\t The mechanism
    by which locales are defined and made available on a processor. \r\n\t The form
    or content of error, flagging, or warning messages. \r\n\t The form and content
    of listings produced during compilation, if any. \r\n\t The form of documentation
    produced by an implementor of products conforming to this document. \r\n\t The
    sharing of objects and resources other than files among run units."
