abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 1989:2023 This document specifies the syntax and semantics of
    COBOL. Its purpose is to promote a high degree of machine independence to permit
    the use of COBOL on a variety of data processing systems.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies:\r\n\r\n\tThe form of a compilation group written in COBOL.\r\n\tThe
    effect of compiling a compilation group.\r\n\tThe effect of executing run units.\r\n\tThe
    elements of the language for which a conforming implementation is required to
    supply a definition.\r\n\tThe elements of the language for which meaning is explicitly
    undefined.\r\n\tThe elements of the language that are dependent on the capabilities
    of the processor.\r\n\r\nThis document does not specify:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe means
    whereby a compilation group written in COBOL is compiled into code executable
    by a processor.\r\n\tThe time at which method, function, or program runtime modules
    are linked or bound to an activating statement, except that runtime binding occurs
    of necessity when the identification of the appropriate program or method is not
    known at compile time.\r\n\tThe time at which parameterized classes and interfaces
    are expanded.\r\n\tThe mechanism by which locales are defined and made available
    on a processor.\r\n\tThe form or content of error, flagging, or warning messages.\r\n\tThe
    form and content of listings produced during compilation, if any.\r\n\tThe form
    of documentation produced by an implementor of products conforming to this document.\r\n\tThe
    sharing of objects and resources other than files among run units."
