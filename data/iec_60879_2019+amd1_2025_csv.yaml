abstract:
- content: "IEC 60879:2019+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies the performance-measuring methods
    of comfort fans and regulators for household and similar purposes, including conventional
    fans, tower fans and bladeless fans, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase fans and 480 V for other fans, and their rated power input
    being less than 125 W.<br />\r\nAccording to the testing method, the comfort fans
    are classified into two groups:<br />\r\n– pedestal fans, table fans, wall fans,
    louvre fans, tower fans, bladeless fans;<br />\r\n– ceiling fans.<br />\r\nWherever
    applicable, the term \"fan\" used in this document includes its associated regulator,
    if any.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to:<br />\r\n– safety of electric
    fans for household and similar purposes (IEC 60335-2-80);<br />\r\n– performance
    of ventilating fans (IEC 60665);<br />\r\n– electromagnetic compatibility of fans
    (CISPR 14-1 and CISPR 14-2, IEC 61000-3-2, IEC 61000-3-3).<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1986. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the definitions of fans have been revised;<br />\r\nb) the test methods for the
    different types of fans have been revised to allow modern test instrumentation
    to be used;<br />\r\nc) acoustic noise measurement and standby power measurement
    methods have been introduced."
