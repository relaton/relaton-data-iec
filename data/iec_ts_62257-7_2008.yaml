abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62257-7:2008(E) specifies the general requirements for generators
    (maximum power = 100 kVA) in decentralized rural electrification systems. Points
    out the main items that must be considered when selecting, sizing, installing,
    operating and maintaining this equipment. Is a general introduction followed by
    more specific documents dedicated to the generation technologies which are the
    most currently used in rural electrification projects.
