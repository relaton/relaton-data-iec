  content: "IEC 60704-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60704-1:2021
    applies to electric appliances (including their accessories or components) for
    household and similar use, supplied from mains or from batteries.<br />\r\nBy
    \"similar use\" is understood the use in conditions similar to those found in
    households, for example in inns, coffee houses, tea rooms, hotels, barber or hairdresser
    shops, launderettes, etc., if not otherwise specified in the IEC 60704-2 series.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances, equipment, or machines
    designed exclusively for industrial or professional purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances
    that are integrated parts of a building or its installations, such as equipment
    for air conditioning, heating and ventilating (except household fans, cooker hoods,
    free-standing heating appliances, dehumidifiers, air cleaners, and stand-alone
    water heaters), oil burners for central heating, pumps for water supply and for
    sewage systems;<br />\r\n– separate motors or generators and<br />\r\n– appliances
    exclusively for outdoor use.<br />\r\nFor determining and verifying noise emission
    values declared in product specifications, see IEC 60704-3:2019.<br />\r\nThis
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2010. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nIt includes the following significant
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update of references
    (especially to ISO standards);<br />\r\nb) revision of requirements on climatic
    conditions;<br />\r\nc) revision of requirements on background noise level."
