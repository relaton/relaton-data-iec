    <p>ISO/IEC 19799:2007 defines methods and processes for measuring objective print quality attributes for the assessment of gloss non-uniformity on printed pages in reflection mode, and provides transforms, when applicable, that relate the objective results to subjective responses if appropriate. The gloss uniformity attributes included in ISO/IEC 19799:2007 are differential gloss, gloss uniformity within a page, and gloss consistency within a run. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19799:2007 provides</p>
    <ul>
    <li>a definition of gloss uniformity attributes representative of the print quality on reflection prints, </li>
    <li>a set of print files for the creation of printed pages for gloss uniformity measurement, </li>
    <li>a procedure for gloss uniformity testing and the analysis of the resulting data, </li>
    <li>a method for evaluating and grading these measurements and deriving an assessment of gloss uniformity, </li>
    <li>the appropriate method of describing the gloss uniformity of printing and copying systems in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The reflection prints that are to be used for measurement can be created via printers or copiers (analog and digital).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19799:2007 is applicable only to electro-photographic based prints. It does not address the measurement of gloss attributes of printed pages in transmission mode.</p>
