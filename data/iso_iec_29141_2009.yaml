abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29141:2009 specifies requirements for the use of ISO/IEC 19784-1,
    as amended by ISO/IEC 19784-1/Amd.1 (BioAPI) for the purpose of performing a tenprint
    capture operation. It specifies a biometric data block format that is used to
    interact with a BioAPI framework [and hence with biometric service providers (BSPs)]
    to support an application wishing to perform a tenprint capture. It specifies
    a capture control block and a capture output block that conforming BSPs are required
    to support if they conform to ISO/IEC 29141:2009.
