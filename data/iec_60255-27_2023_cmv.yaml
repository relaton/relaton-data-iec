abstract:
- content: "IEC 60255-27:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60255-27:2023 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60255-27:2013
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 95 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60255-27:2023 specifies the product safety requirements for measuring
    relays and protection equipment having a rated AC voltage up to 1 000 V, or a
    rated DC voltage up to 1 500 V. This document specifies essential safety requirements
    to minimize the risk of fire and hazards caused by electric shock or injury to
    the user and property. This document specifies only product safety requirements;
    functional performance of the equipment is not covered. This document covers all
    the ways in which the equipment can be mounted and used in cabinets, racks and
    panels. This document also applies to auxiliary devices such as shunts, series
    resistors, transformers, auxiliary control panels, display devices, etc., that
    are used in conjunction with measuring relays and protection equipment and are
    tested together."
