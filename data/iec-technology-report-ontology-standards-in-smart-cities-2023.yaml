  content: "Ontology is crucial for IoT, big data, AI, and smart city systems. It
    enhances interoperability, traceability, and intelligent decision-making. Ontology
    also plays a crucial role in the development of standards that are considered
    as SMART. However, a common understanding and approach to ontology are lacking
    among different standards organizations.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis report is an
    output of the international virtual seminar Standards Collaboration on Ontologies
    for Smart Cities and Smart City Systems, jointly hosted by the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/academy\">IEC
    Academy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:186:::::FSP_ORG_ID:13073\">IEC
