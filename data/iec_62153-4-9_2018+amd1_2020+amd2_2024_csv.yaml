abstract:
- content: "IEC 62153-4-9:2018+AMD1:2020+AMD2:2024 CSV applies to metallic communication
    cables. It specifies a test method for determining the coupling attenuation aC
    of screened balanced cables. Due to the concentric outer tube, measurements are
    independent of irregularities on the circumference and external electromagnetic
    fields. A wide dynamic and frequency range can be applied to test even super screened
    cables with normal instrumentation from low frequencies up to the limit of defined
    transversal waves in the outer circuit at approximately 4 GHz. However, when using
    a balun, the upper frequency is limited by the properties of the balun. Measurements
    can be performed with standard tube procedure (respectively with standard test
    head) according to IEC 62153-4-4 or with open tube (open test head) procedure.
    The procedure described herein to measure the coupling attenuation aC is based
    on the procedure to measure the screening attenuation aS according to IEC 62153-4-4.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- two test procedures, open head and standard head procedure;<br />\r\n-
    measuring with balun or with multiport respectively mixed mode VNA;<br />\r\n-
    extension of frequency range up to and above 2 GHz."
