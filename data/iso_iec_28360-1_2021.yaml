- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    28360-1:2021 This document (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical
    emission rates of analytes from ICT & CE equipment during intended operation in
    an Emission Test Chamber (ETC).<br />\r\nThis document (all parts) includes specific
    methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using
    consumables, such as monitors and PC’s.<br />\r\nPart 1 specifies the methods
    to determine the emission rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds, ozone, particulate
    matter, fine particles (FP) and ultra-fine particles (UFP) from electronic equipment
    using consumables.<br />\r\nThe methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring)
    in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission
    rates.<br />\r\nPart 1 has two different methods for the determination of emission
    rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds. The two methods use two different emission
    models, the quasi-equilibrium model (QEM) and the constant emission model (CEM)
    respectively, to determine the emission rates of VOC and carbonyl compounds during
    the pre-operating phase.<br />\r\nThe quasi-equilibrium model method has been
    developed with hard copy devices for office or home use in mind whose energy-saving
    modes automatically activate during most intervals between operations. The calculation
    of emission rates during the pre-operating phase is based on the quasi-equilibrium
    assumption as shown in Annex C.<br />\r\nThe emission rates determined with this
    method can be used to compare equipment in the same class since test procedures
    are specified more narrowly than the other method (CEM).<br />\r\nThe constant
    emission model (CEM) has been developed for hard copy devices whose energy-saving
    modes have such a negligible effect on the determination of emission rates of
    VOC and carbonyl compounds that the generalised constant emission model shown
    in Annex D can be used for the determination of their emission rates during the
    pre-operating phase. This method presents more flexible test procedures than the
    QEM. Due to such features of this method, it may be used for hard copy devices
    whose idling mode usually lasts throughout intervals between operations, such
    as large hard copy devices used professionally. It may also be used for various
    equipment having different functions and structure for its intended use and the
    determination of carbonyl compounds requiring longer sampling duration due to
    a lack of sensitivity.<br />\r\nAnnex A specifies monochrome and colour print
    patterns for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables.<br />\r\nThe
    operational readiness of AMS is confirmed according to Annex B.<br />\r\nPredictions
    of “real indoor” concentrations from the determined emission rates are outside
    the scope of this document."
