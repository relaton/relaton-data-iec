  content: "Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are generating increasing interest from
    industry and research. This is driven by the availability of inexpensive, low-powered
    miniature components such as processors, radios and sensors which are sometimes
    integrated on a single chip.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe idea of the Internet of Things
    (IoT) developed in parallel to WSNs. While IoT doesn’t assume a specific communication
    technology, wireless communication technologies will play a major role in the
    roll-out of the IoT. WSNs will drive many applications and many industries.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper discusses the use and evolution of WSNs in
    the wider context of the IoT. It provides a review of WSN applications, infrastructures
    technologies, applications as well as standards that apply to WSN designs.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThe development of this White Paper was led by the <a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">IEC
    MSB</a> (Market Strategy Board) which brings together CTOs of leading international
    companies in cooperation with NIST (the US National Institute of Standards and
    Technology).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/internet-things-wireless-sensor-networks\">free
    download</a>."
