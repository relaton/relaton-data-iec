  content: "IEC TR 61282-14:2024, which is a Technical Report, establishes a detailed
    analysis and calculations of the uncertainties related to the measurement of the
    attenuation of both multimode and single-mode optical fibre cabling, using optical
    light sources and power meters. It also includes simplified analysis and calculation
    of the uncertainties related to the measurement of the attenuation of single-mode
    optical fibre cabling using OTDRs. This document contains an attached file in
    the form of an Excel spreadsheet. This file is intended to be used as a complement
    and does not form an integral part of the document. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of uncertainties
    calculation for optical time domain reflectometer (OTDR) measurement methods based
    on the analysis provided in 61280-4-3;<br />\r\nb) addition of uncertainties calculation
    for passive optical networks (PON);<br />\r\nc) update of the list of reference
    grade connectors;<br />\r\nd) addition of probability distribution in Table D.1."
