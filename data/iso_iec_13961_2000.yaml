abstract:
- content: The scalable coherent interface (SCI) provides computer-bus-like services
    but, instead of a bus, uses a collection of fast point-to-point unidirectional
    links to provide the far higher throughput needed for high-performance multiprocessor
    systems. SCI supports distributed, shared memory with optional cache coherence
    for tightly coupled systems, and message-passing for loosely coupled systems.
    Initial SCI links are defined at 1 Gbyte&#x2F;s (16-bit parallel) and 1 Gb&#x2F;s
    (serial). For applications requiring modular packaging, an interchangeable module
    is specified along with connector and power. The packets and protocols that implement
    transactions are defined and their formal specification is provided in the form
    of computer programs. In addition to the usual read-and-write transactions, SCI
    supports efficient multiprocessor lock transactions. The distributed cache-coherence
    protocols are efficient and can recover from an arbitrary number of transmission
    failures. SCI protocols ensure forward progress despite multiprocessor conflicts
    (no deadlocks or starvation).
