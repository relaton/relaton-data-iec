    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60884-2-6:2025
    applies to switched socket-outlets with interlock for AC only, for fixed electrical
    installations, with or without earthing contact, with rated voltage above 50 V
    but not exceeding 440 V and a rated current not exceeding 32 A, intended for household
    and similar purposes, either indoors or outdoors. Switched socket-outlets with
    interlock according to this document consist of a combination of socket-outlets
    according to IEC 60884‑1, interlocked with a switch according to IEC 60669‑1 and/or
    IEC 60669‑2‑1 supplied as a complete accessory. The rated current is limited to
    16 A maximum for fixed accessories provided with screwless terminals.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not cover requirements for flush mounting boxes. However, it covers
    those requirements for surface-type mounting boxes which are necessary for the
    tests on socket-outlets.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
