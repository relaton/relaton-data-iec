  content: ISO/IEC TR 29125:2010 targets the support of applications that provide
    remote power over balanced cabling to terminal equipment; covers the transmission
    and electrical parameters needed to support remote power over balanced cabling;
    covers various installation scenarios and how these may impact the capability
    of balanced cabling to support remote powering; specifies design and configuration
    of cabling as specified in International Standards ISO/IEC 11801, ISO/IEC 15018,
    ISO/IEC 24702 and ISO/IEC 24764; provides requirements and guidelines that will
    enable the support of a wide variety of extra low voltage (ELV) limited power
    source (LPS) applications using remote power supplied over balanced cabling.
