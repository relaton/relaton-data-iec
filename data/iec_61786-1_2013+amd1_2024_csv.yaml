abstract:
- content: "IEC 61786-1:2013+AMD1:2024 CSV provides guidance for measuring instruments
    used to measure the field strength of quasi-static magnetic and electric fields
    that have a frequency content in the range 1 Hz to 100 kHz and with DC magnetic
    fields to evaluate the exposure levels of the human body to these fields. Sources
    of fields include devices that operate at power frequencies and produce power
    frequency and power frequency harmonic fields, as well as devices that produce
    fields within the frequency range of this document, including devices that produce
    static fields, and the earth's static magnetic field. The magnitude ranges covered
    by this standard are 0,1 μT to 200 mT in AC (1 μT to 10 T in DC) and 1 V/m to
    50 kV/m for magnetic fields and electric fields, respectively. When measurements
    outside this range are performed, most of the provisions of this standard will
    still apply, but special attention should be paid to specified uncertainty and
    calibration procedures. The first editions of IEC 61786-1 and IEC 61786-2 replace
    IEC 61786:1998. Part 1 deals with measuring instruments, and Part 2 deals with
    measurement procedures. The content of the standard was revised in order to give
    up-to-date and practical information to the user.<br />\r\nIt has the status of
    a horizontal standard in accordance with IEC Guide 108."
