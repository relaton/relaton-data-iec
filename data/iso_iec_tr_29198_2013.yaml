abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC TR 29198:2013 provides
    guidance on estimating how "challenging" or "stressing" is an evaluation dataset
    for fingerprint recognition, based on relative sample quality, relative rotation,
    deformation, and overlap between impressions. In addition, it establishes a method
    for construction of datasets of different levels of difficulty. It defines the
    relative level of difficulty of a fingerprint dataset used in technology evaluation
    of fingerprint recognition algorithms. Level of difficulty is based on differences
    between reference and probe samples in the aforementioned factors. ISO/IEC TR
    29198:2013 addresses such issues as:</p><ul><li>characterizing level of difficulty
    attributable to differences between samples acquired from the same finger,</li><li>developing
    statistical methodologies for representing the level of difficulty of a fingerprint
    dataset by aggregating influencing factors,</li><li>comparing the level of difficulty
    of different fingerprint datasets,</li><li>defining procedures for testing and
    reporting the level of difficulty of fingerprint datasets collected for technology
    evaluation,</li><li>analysing mated pair data characteristics based on comparison
    scores,</li><li>describing the archived data selection methodology for building
    a dataset for evaluation.</li></ul><p>It provides guidelines for comparing the
    relative level of difficulty of fingerprint datasets.</p><p>Outside the scope
    of ISO/IEC TR 29198:2013 are:</p><ul><li>defining the quality of individual fingerprint
    images,</li><li>defining the methodologies or explicit measures for evaluating
    or predicting the performance of fingerprint recognition algorithms.</li></ul>
