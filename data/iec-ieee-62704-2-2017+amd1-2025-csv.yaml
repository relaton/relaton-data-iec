  content: "IEC/IEEE 62704-2:2017+A1:2025 establishes the concepts, techniques, validation
    procedures, uncertainties and limitations of the finite difference time domain
    technique (FDTD) when used for determining the peak spatial-average and whole-body
    average specific absorption rate (SAR) in a standardized human anatomical model
    exposed to the electromagnetic field emitted by vehicle mounted antennas in the
    frequency range from 30 MHz to 1 GHz, which covers typical high power mobile radio
    products and applications. This document specifies and provides the test vehicle,
    human body models and the general benchmark data for those models. It defines
    antenna locations, operating configurations, exposure conditions, and positions
    that are typical of persons exposed to the fields generated by vehicle mounted
    antennas. The extended frequency range up to 6 GHz will be considered in future
    revisions of this document. This document does not recommend specific peak spatial-average
    and whole-body average SAR limits since these are found in other documents, e.g.
    IEEE C95.1-2005, ICNIRP (1998).<br />\r\nKey words: Electromagnetic Field, Finite-Difference
    Time Domain (FDTD), Spatial-Average Specific Absorption Rate (SAR), vehicle mounted
    antennas"
