abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594 has been produced to facilitate the interconnection of
    information processing systems to provide directory services. A set of such systems,
    together with the directory information that they hold, can be viewed as an integrated
    whole, called the Directory. The information held by the Directory, collectively
    known as the Directory Information Base (DIB), is typically used to facilitate
    communication between, with or about objects such as application entities, people,
    terminals and distribution lists.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9594-8:2014 defines a framework
    for public-key certificates. This framework includes the specification of data
    objects used to represent the certificates themselves, as well as revocation notices
    for issued certificates that should no longer be trusted. The public-key certificate
    framework defined in ISO/IEC 9594-8:2014, while it defines some critical components
    of a public-key infrastructure (PKI), it does not define a PKI in its entirety.
    However, it provides the foundation upon which full PKIs and their specifications
    would be built.</p><p>Similarly, ISO/IEC 9594-8:2014 defines a framework for attribute
    certificates. That framework includes the specification of data objects used to
    represent the certificates themselves, as well as revocation notices for issued
    certificates that should no longer be trusted. The attribute certificate framework
    defined in ISO/IEC 9594-8:2014, while it defines some critical components of a
    Privilege Management Infrastructure (PMI), it does not define a PMI in its entirety.
    However, it provides the foundation upon which full PMIs and their specifications
    would be built.</p><p>Information objects for holding PKI and PMI objects in the
    Directory and for comparing presented values with stored values are also defined.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    9594-8:2014 also defines a framework for the provision of authentication services
    by the Directory to its users.</p>"
