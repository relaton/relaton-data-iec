  content: "IEC 60749-28:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60749-28:2022
    establishes the procedure for testing, evaluating, and classifying devices and
    microcircuits according to their susceptibility (sensitivity) to damage or degradation
    by exposure to a defined field-induced charged device model (CDM) electrostatic
    discharge (ESD). All packaged semiconductor devices, thin film circuits, surface
    acoustic wave (SAW) devices, opto-electronic devices, hybrid integrated circuits
    (HICs), and multi-chip modules (MCMs) containing any of these devices are to be
    evaluated according to this document. To perform the tests, the devices are assembled
    into a package similar to that expected in the final application. This CDM document
    does not apply to socketed discharge model testers. This document describes the
    field-induced (FI) method. An alternative, the direct contact (DC) method, is
    described in Annex J. The purpose of this document is to establish a test method
    that will replicate CDM failures and provide reliable, repeatable CDM ESD test
    results from tester to tester, regardless of device type. Repeatable data will
    allow accurate classifications and comparisons of CDM ESD sensitivity levels.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- a new subclause and annex relating to the
    problems associated with CDM testing of integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors
    in very small packages;<br />\r\n- changes to clarify cleaning of devices and
    testers."
