  content: "IEC 62899-202:2023 defines the terms and specifies the standard test methods
    for characterization and evaluation of conductive inks. This document also provides
    measurement methods for evaluating the properties of conductive layers made both
    from an additive process using conductive inks and from a subtractive process
    used in printed electronics. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) definitions of conductive
    material, conductive ink and conductive layer have been revised;<br />\r\nb) a
    summary of test methods is added;<br />\r\nc) mechanical tests for conductive
    layer are added."
