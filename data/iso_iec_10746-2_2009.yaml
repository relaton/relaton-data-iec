abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 10746 provides a coordinating framework for the standardization
    of open distributed processing (ODP). This supports distribution, interworking,
    portability, and platform and technology independence. It establishes an enterprise
    architecture framework for the specification of ODP systems.</p><p>ISO/IEC 10746
    defines the essential concepts necessary to specify open distributed processing
    systems from five prescribed viewpoints. It provides a well-developed framework
    for the structuring of specifications for large-scale, distributed systems.</p><p>The
    framework for system specification provided by ISO/IEC 10746 has four fundamental
    elements:</p><ul><li>an object modelling approach to system specification;</li><li>the
    specification of a system in terms of separate but interrelated viewpoint specifications;</li><li>the
    definition of a system infrastructure providing distribution transparencies for
    system applications;</li><li>a framework for assessing system conformance.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    10746-2:2009 contains the definition of the concepts and analytical framework
    for normalized description of any distributed processing system. It introduces
    the principles of conformance to ODP standards and the way in which they are applied.
    These concepts and principles are used in ISO/IEC 10746-3 and to establish requirements
    for new ODP specification techniques.</p>"
