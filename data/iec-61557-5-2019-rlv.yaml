  content: "IEC 61557-5:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61557-5:2019
    specifies the requirements applicable to measuring equipment for measuring the
    resistance to earth using an AC voltage. IEC 61557-5:2019 cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) definitions and symbols in Clause 3 modified;<br
    />\r\nb) subclauses in Clause 4 restructured and aligned with other parts of the
    series;<br />\r\nc) limits for reduced voltages 25 V RMS or 35 V peak removed
    from 4.5;<br />\r\nd) requirements for clamps added;<br />\r\ne) marking for rated
    voltages to earth and measurement category added to Clause 5;<br />\r\nf) warning
    about absence of hazardous voltage added in Clause 5;<br />\r\ng) the term \"percentage
    operating uncertainty\" replaced by \"operating uncertainty\" in Clause 6;<br
    />\r\nh) equation for uncertainty corrected in Table 1;<br />\r\ni) new Annex
    A on test measurements with loop clamps added."
