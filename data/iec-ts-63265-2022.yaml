  content: "IEC TS 63265:2022 outlines methods that can be utilized to ensure reliability
    throughout the PVPS project phases. It is derived from a management motivation
    for long lasting and cost-effective energy performance, energy production, secure
    production and revenue, and safe function. The application of reliability practices
    in this document is designed to be practical and reduce the costs of unreliability.
    This document further identifies and defines a normative minimum set of processes
    and tools to meet the requirements of this document.<br />\r\nKey objectives of
    this document are to inform users of reliability tools and assessment methods
    (historic, predictive, and analytical) that can satisfy the stakeholders needs
    for dependable PV Power System (PVPS) operation. This document provides a fundamental
    process for ensuring reliability needs can be understood and met. IEC TS 63019
    addresses availability which is a higher-level metric that combines reliability
    and maintainability, and it complements this document as a key normative standard.
    It should be used in combination with this document."
