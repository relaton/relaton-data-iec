abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 27034-7:2018 This document describes the minimum requirements
    when the required activities specified by an Application Security Control (ASC)
    are replaced with a Prediction Application Security Rationale (PASR). The ASC
    mapped to a PASR define the Expected Level of Trust for a subsequent application.
    In the context of an Expected Level of Trust, there is always an original application
    where the project team performed the activities of the indicated ASC to achieve
    an Actual Level of Trust.<br />\r\nThe use of Prediction Application Security
    Rationales (PASRs), defined by this document, is applicable to project teams which
    have a defined Application Normative Framework (ANF) and an original application
    with an Actual Level of Trust.<br />\r\nPredictions relative to aggregation of
    multiple components or the history of the developer in relation to other applications
    is outside the scope of this document."
