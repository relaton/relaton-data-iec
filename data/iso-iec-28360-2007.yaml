    <p>ISO/IEC 28360:2007 specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from information and communication technology and consumer electronics equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC). </p>
    <p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 28360:2007 includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PCs.</p>
