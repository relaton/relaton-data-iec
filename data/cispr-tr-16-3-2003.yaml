    This part of CISPR 16 contains specific technical reports and information on the history of CISPR.

    CISPR 16-3 has been reorganised into 4 parts, to accommodate growth and easier maintenance. This second edition of CISPR 16-3, together with CISPR 16-4-1, CISPR  16-4-3 and CISPR 16-4-4, cancels and replaces the first edition of CISPR 16-3, published in 2000, and its amendment 1 (2002). It contains the relevant clauses of CISPR 16-3 without technical changes.
