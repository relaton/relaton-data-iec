abstract:
- content: CISPR/TR 30-2:2012(E), which is a technical report, details with the aid
    of reference luminaires, an independent method by which the radio disturbance
    characteristics of built-in electronic control gear for discharge (excluding fluorescent)
    lamp luminaires with protection classes I and/or II may be compared against the
    requirements of CISPR 15. The scope of the part is limited to electronic lamp
    control gear with an output power (lamp power) up to and including 150 W. Independent
    electronic lamp control gears are not covered by this technical report; they are
    within the scope of CISPR 15. This first edition of CISPR/TR 30-2 is published
    in conjunction with CISPR/TR 30-1. Each part of CISPR 30 series is independent
    and describes the test set-up for electronic control gear use together with a
    special lamp family.
