  content: "IEC 61691-8:2021(E) defines the Analog/Mixed-Signal extensions for SystemC®,
    as an ANSI standard C++ class<br />\r\nlibrary based on SystemC for system and
    hardware design including analog/mixed-signal elements. The general purpose of
    the SystemC AMS extensions is to provide a C++ standard for designers and architects,
    who need to address complex heterogeneous systems that are a hybrid between hardware
    and software. This standard is built on the IEEE Std 1666™-2011 (SystemC Language
    Reference Manual) and extends it to create analog/mixed-signal, multi-disciplinary
    models to simulate continuous-time, discrete-time, and discrete-event behavior
    simultaneously.<br />\r\nThis standard is published as a double logo IEC-IEEE
    standard."
