abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15938-7:2003 specifies a metadata system for describing multimedia
    content. ISO/IEC 15938-7:2003 specifies how tests can be designed to verify whether
    descriptions and description consuming terminals meet the specifications of parts
    1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of ISO/IEC IEC 15938. In ISO/IEC 15938-7:2003, the creation or
    extraction of descriptions from multimedia content is not addressed specifically.
    A system producing descriptions may be said to be an ISO/IEC 15938 compatible
    description production system if it produces descriptions (binary or textual)
    that conform to the specifications of parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938.</p><p>The
    characteristics of descriptions and the terminals consuming descriptions are defined
    for parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938 as follows.</p><ul><li><strong>Descriptions</strong>:
    the characteristics of a specific description are defined according to syntax
    and semantics of elements from ISO/IEC 15938 (all parts) that are used in the
    description.</li><li><strong>Terminals</strong>: the characteristics of a terminal
    consuming a description are defined according to the required description decoding
    process for the elements used in the description. An example of a description
    decoding property is the arithmetic accuracy in which the value of element are
    represented. The capabilities of a description consuming terminal are determined
    by the domain of descriptions and elements that the terminal is capable of decoding.
    A description can be decoded by a terminal if the elements of the description
    are within the subset of ISO/IEC 15938 (all parts) specified for a given definition
    of decoder capabilities.</li></ul><p>Guidelines are given on constructing tests
    to verify conformance of descriptions and terminals. ISO/IEC 15938-7:2003 provides
    additional guidelines on how to construct test suites for checking conformance
    of terminals. In addition, some test descriptions are provided.</p><p>The conformance
    testing consists of two stages: Systems testing and Description Definition Language
    (DDL) testing. The Systems conformance testing involves decoding the description
    stream, which may be in binary or textual access unit form, and checking that
    after the decoding of each access unit the current description tree maintained
    by the terminal is DDL conformant. In the case that the input description to the
    Systems processor is an XML file, the conformance is directly performed by the
    DDL testing. The DDL conformance testing involves parsing the textual XML description
    and checking that the description is well-formed and valid according to the schema
    comprised from parts 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938. The conformance testing
    of descriptions does not involve checking the semantics of the descriptions.</p>"
