  content: IEC 61588:2021 defines a network protocol, the Precision Time Protocol
    (PTP), enabling accurate and precise synchronization of the real-time clocks of
    devices in networked distributed systems. The protocol is applicable to systems
    where devices communicate via networks, including Ethernet. The standard allows
    multicast communication, unicast communication or both. The standard specifies
    requirements for mapping the protocol to specific network implementations and
    defines such mappings, including User Datagram Protocol (UDP)/Internet Protocol
    (IP versions 4 and 6), and layer-2 IEEE 802.3 Ethernet.
