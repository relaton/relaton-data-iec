  content: "IEC 62657-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62657-2:2025
    specifies:<br />\r\n– the fundamental assumptions, concepts, parameters, and procedures
    for wireless communication coexistence;<br />\r\n– specifies coexistence parameters
    and how they are used in an application requiring wireless coexistence;<br />\r\n–
    provides guidelines, requirements, and best practices for wireless communication's
    availability and performance in an industrial automation plant; it covers the
    life‑cycle of wireless communication coexistence;<br />\r\n– helps the work of
    all persons involved with the relevant responsibilities to cope with the critical
    aspects at each phase of life-cycle of the wireless communication coexistence
    management in an industrial automation plant. Life-cycle aspects include: planning,
    design, installation, implementation, operation, maintenance, administration and
    training;<br />\r\n– provides a common point of reference for wireless communication
    coexistence for industrial automation sites as a homogeneous guideline to help
    the users assess and gauge their plant efforts;<br />\r\n– deals with the operational
    aspects of wireless communication coexistence regarding both the static human/tool-organization
    and the dynamic network self-organization.<br />\r\nThis document provides a major
    contribution to national and regional regulations by supporting to fulfil the
    requirements using coexistence management.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment of some definitions and specifications of coexistence parameters
    in order to facilitate their future inclusion in the IEC Common Data Dictionary
    (IEC CDD) maintained by the IEC;<br />\r\nb) alignment of some definitions and
    specifications to be consistent with the new IEC 62657-3 and IEC 62657-4;<br />\r\nc)
    edition 3 of this document was published in June 2022. Some comments were made
    in the last development stages of this document asking for explanations on how
    the parts of the IEC 62657 series were structured and how they were related to
    each other. Resolution of these comments was deferred until a next edition, which
    means this edition."
