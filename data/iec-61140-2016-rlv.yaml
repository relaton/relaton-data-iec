  content: "IEC 61140:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61140:2016
    applies to the protection of persons and livestock against electric shock. The
    intent is to give fundamental principles and requirements which are common to
    electrical installations, systems and equipment or necessary for their coordination,
    without limitations with regard to the magnitude of the voltage or current, or
    the type of current, and for frequencies up to 1 000 Hz. It has the status of
    a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104. This fourth edition
    cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2001 and Amendment 1:2004.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision."
