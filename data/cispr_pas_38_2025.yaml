abstract:
- content: "CISPR PAS 38:2025, which is a Publicly Available Specification, applies
    to radio beam wireless power transfer (RB‑WPT) as industrial, scientific, and
    medical equipment operating in the frequency range of 0 Hz to 400 GHz and designed
    to operate up to a distance of 10 m. This document covers emission requirements
    related to radio-frequency disturbances in the frequency range of 150 kHz to 18
    GHz. Radio beam wireless power transfer devices are in the scope of this document
    only if they are not classified as radio apparatus.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Wireless power
    transfer devices that use a modulated signal to transmit both power and information
    are classified as radio apparatus in most countries. While radio beam wireless
    power transfer devices are included in the scope of this document, these can be
    classified as radio apparatus in some countries, even if the transmitted signal
    is continuous wave, with no modulation. The user is advised to verify the applicable
    national radio regulations before applying this document for these types of devices,
    especially regarding to limits applicable within the ISM bands wherein this document
    allows unrestricted radiation.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Radio beam wireless power transfer
    devices can generate significant electromagnetic energy. While this document does
    not include requirements for radio-frequency (RF) exposure, the user is warned
    to take appropriate measures to ensure testing personnel and other bystanders
    are not subjected to harmful levels of RF exposure from the product under test.<br
    />\r\nThis PAS adopts the requirements from CISPR 11 and provides important clarifications
    on the application of CISPR 11 for RB-WPT."
