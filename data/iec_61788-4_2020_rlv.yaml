abstract:
- content: "IEC 61788-4:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61788-4:2020 specifies a
    test method for the determination of the residual resistance ratio (RRR) of Nb-Ti
    and Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn composite superconductors with Cu, Cu-Ni, Cu/Cu-Ni and Al
    matrix in a strain-free condition and zero external magnetic field. This method
    is intended for use with superconductor specimens that have a monolithic structure
    with rectangular or round cross-section, RRR value less than 350, and cross-sectional
    area less than 3 mm<sup>2</sup>. In the case of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn, the specimens
    have received a reaction heat-treatment. This fifth edition cancels and replaces
    the fourth edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) change in the suitable distance of voltage
    taps on the specimen for reliable measurement,<br />\r\nb) new report on the result
    of the round robin test of the residual resistance ratio of Nb<sub>3</sub>Sn superconductors
    that proves the validity of the measurement method in this standard,<br />\r\nc)
    revision of the confusing definitions of the copper ratio and copper fraction.</p>"
