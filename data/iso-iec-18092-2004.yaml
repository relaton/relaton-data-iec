    <p>ISO/IEC 18092:2004 defines communication modes for Near Field Communication Interface and Protocol (NFCIP-1) using inductive coupled devices operating at the centre frequency of 13,56 MHz for interconnection of computer peripherals. It also defines both the Active and the Passive communication modes of NFCIP-1 to realize a communication network using Near Field Communication devices for networked products and also for consumer equipment. This International Standard specifies, in particular, modulation schemes, codings, transfer speeds and frame format of the RF interface, as well as initialization schemes and conditions required for data collision control during initialization. Furthermore, this International Standard defines a transport protocol including protocol activation and data exchange methods.</p>
    <p>Information interchange between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange codes and the data structure.</p>
