abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-1:2016 introduces the major concepts required to understand
    and use the ISO/IEC 29110 series. It introduces the characteristics and requirements
    of a VSE and clarifies the rationale for VSE-specific profiles, documents, standards
    and guides.</p><p>It also introduces process, lifecycle, standardization concepts
    and defines the organizational terms common to the VSE Profile Set of Documents.</p><p>It
    is applicable to a VSE. A VSE is an entity (enterprise, organization, department
    or project) having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC
    29110 series, Standardized Profiles and Technical Reports are not intended to
    preclude nor discourage their use by an entity that is larger than a VSE.</p><p>It
    is targeted both at the general audience wishing to understand the series of documents
    and, more specifically, at users of the ISO/IEC 29110 series. It should be read
    first when initially exploring VSE Profile documents. While there is no specific
    prerequisite to read this part of ISO/IEC 29110, it will be helpful to the user
    in understanding the other parts.</p><p>The lifecycle processes defined in the
    set of Standardized Profiles and Technical Reports can be used by a VSE when developing,
    acquiring and using, as well as when creating and supplying systems having hardware
    and software elements and software. They can be applied at any level in a systems
    development, software system's structure and at any stage in the lifecycle. They
    are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that
    a VSE finds useful.</p>"
