abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 24731-1:2007 provides alternative functions for the C Library
    (as defined in ISO/IEC 9899:1999) that promote safer, more secure programming.
    The functions verify that output buffers are large enough for the intended result,
    and return a failure indicator if they are not. Optionally, failing functions
    call a "runtime-constraint handler" to report the error. Data is never written
    past the end of an array. All string results are null terminated. In addition,
    the functions in ISO/IEC TR 24731-1:2007 are re-entrant: they never return pointers
    to static objects owned by the function.ISO/IEC TR 24731-1:2007 also contains
    functions that address insecurities with the C input-output facilities.'
