abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-7:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62841-2-7:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62841-1:2014.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62841-2-7:2024 deals with the safety of
    electric motor-operated hand-held spray guns for non-flammable materials. The
    rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools, and
    480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W. The
    limits for the applicability of this standard for battery tools are given in K.1
    and L.1. This standard deals with the hazards presented by tools which are encountered
    by all persons in the normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the tools.
    Hand-held electric tools, which can be mounted on a support or working stand for
    use as fixed tools without any alteration of the tool itself, are within the scope
    of this standard and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support is considered
    to be a transportable tool and thus covered by the relevant Part 3. This Part
    2-7 is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014. The
    attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers
    and testing organizations may need a transitional period following publication
    of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance
    with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised
    tests. It is the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication
    be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date
    of publication."
