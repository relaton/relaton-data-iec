    <p>This document is intended to provide a generic extensible full body image data format for biometric recognition applications requiring exchange of human full body image data. Typical applications are:</p>
    <p>a) automated body biometric verification and identification of an unknown individual or cadaver (one-to-one as well as one-to-many comparison);</p>
    <p>b) support for human verification of identity by comparison of individuals against full body images; and</p>
    <p>c) support for human examination of full body images with sufficient resolution to allow a human examiner to verify identity or identify a living individual or a cadaver.</p>
    <p>This document ensures that full human body images and image sequence data generated by video surveillance and other similar systems are suitable for identification and verification.</p>
    <p>The structure of the data format in this document is compatible with ISO/IEC 39794-5. In addition to the data format, this document specifies application-specific profiles including scene constraints, photographic properties and digital image attributes like image spatial sampling rate, image size, etc. These application profiles are contained in a series of annexes.</p>
    <p>The 3D encoding types "3D point map" and "range image" are not supported by this document.</p>
