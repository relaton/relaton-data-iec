abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62672-1:2013(E) applies to all line-commutated high-voltage direct
    current (HVDC) transmission systems used for power exchange in utility systems.
    HVDC stations with voltage sourced converters (VSC) are not covered. The purpose
    of this part of IEC 62672 is to define a standardized reporting protocol so that
    data collected from different HVDC transmission systems can be compared on an
    equitable basis. It covers point-to-point transmission systems, back-to-back interconnections
    and multi-terminal transmission systems. For point-to-point systems and back-to-back
    interconnections, i.e. two-terminal systems, statistics are to be reported based
    on the total transmission capability from the sending end to the receiving end
    measured at a given point. If, however, the two terminals are operated by different
    users/owners, or are composed of equipment of different vintage or of equipment
    from different suppliers, statistics can be reported on an individual station
    basis if so desired by those responsible for reporting. In such a case, the outage
    should only be reported under the originating converter station taking care not
    to report the same event twice. For distributed multi-terminal systems, i.e. systems
    with more than two terminals, statistics are to be reported separately for each
    converter station based on its own individual capability.
