abstract:
- content: "IEC 60794-1-22:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60794-1-22:2017
    defines test procedures to be used in establishing uniform requirements for the
    environmental performance of:<br />\r\n- optical fibre cables for use with telecommunication
    equipment and devices employing similar techniques, and<br />\r\n- cables having
    a combination of both optical fibres and electrical conductors.<br />\r\nThroughout
    this document, the wording \"optical cable\" can also include optical fibre units,
    microduct fibre units, etc. See IEC 60794-1-2 for a reference guide to test methods
    of all types and for general requirements and definitions. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. It constitutes a technical
    revision. This second edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- new test method designation F16
    – Compound flow (drip) [E14 in IEC 60794-1-21];<br />\r\n- new test method F17
    – Cable shrinkage test (fibre protrusion);<br />\r\n- new test method F18 – Mid-span
    temperature cycling test.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords: optical fibre cables for use
    with telecommunication equipment"
