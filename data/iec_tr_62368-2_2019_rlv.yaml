abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62368-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC TR 62368-2:2019 provides
    explanatory information related to IEC 62368-1. Only those subclauses considered
    to need further background reference information or explanation of their content
    to benefit the reader are included. Therefore, not all numbered subclauses are
    cited. Unless otherwise noted, all references are to clauses, subclauses, annexes,
    figures or tables located in IEC 62368-1:2018. This third edition updates the
    second edition of IEC 62368-2 published in 2014 to take into account changes made
    to IEC 62368-1:2014 as identified in the Foreword of IEC 62368-1:2018. This Technical
    Report is informative only. In case of a conflict between IEC 62368-1 and IEC
    TR 62368-2, the requirements in IEC 62368-1 prevail over this Technical Report.<br
