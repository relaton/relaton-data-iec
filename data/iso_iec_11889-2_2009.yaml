abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11889 defines the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), a device that enables trust in
    computing platforms in general. ISO/IEC 11889-2:2009 defines the principles of
    TPM operation. These include base operating modes, cryptographic algorithms and
    key sizes for the algorithms, basic interoperability requirements, basic protocols
    and the use of the protocols, and use of TPM resources.<br />\r\nThis standard
    has been revised by ISO/IEC 11889-2:2015. However, the 2009 Edition remains available
    through 2025 to permit stakeholders to complete technical work tailoring their
    adoption of the 2015 Edition to meet their security and privacy objectives."
