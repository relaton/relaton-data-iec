abstract:
- content: 'This standard specifies a generic cabling for three groups of applications
    in homes: Information and Communications Technologies (ICT), Broadcast and Communications
    Technologies (BCT), and Commands, Controls and Communications in Buildings (CCCB).
    It is intended to guide installations in new buildings or refurbishments, and
    also applies where cabling is installed to support only one or two of the three
    application groups listed above. A generic cabling infrastructure is specified
    based upon balanced cabling and / or coaxial cabling. ICT channels specified in
    this standard include optical fibre, but the wider use of fibre optical cabling
    in a home is for further study. The three groups of applications may also be supported
    by different types of cabling, which may be subject to other standards. For example,
    ISO/IEC 11801 specifies generic cabling for ICT applications in general for the
    office environment. While the cabling structure and reference implementations
    are matched to the home environment in this standard, the channel performances
    specified for ICT are identical to those specified in ISO/IEC 11801. Because this
    standard is designed to cover the three major groups, the cabling system may be
    installed prior to the selection of specific applications. The home may contain
    one or more buildings (e.g. farm) or may be within a building which contains more
    than one home (e.g. one home in a multi-dwelling building). The campus or backbone
    cabling connecting individual homes is built according to the relevant standard
    (for instance ISO/IEC 11801, IEC 60728). Generic cabling realised according to
    this standard: a) allows deployment of a wide range of applications without changes
    to the fixed cabling infrastructure; b) provides a platform to support moves,
    adds and changes of connectivity. This standard provides users with an application-independent
    generic cabling for applications run in homes, and a flexible cabling scheme such
    that changes are both easy and economical; it provides building professionals
    (for example, architects) with guidance for accommodating cabling before specific
    requirements are known, i.e. in the initial planning either for construction or
    refurbishment; and gives users, designers, and manufacturers of application-specific
    cabling systems advice on interfacing. It specifies relevant requirements for
    suppliers of cabling components and installers of cabling, and a distribution
    system for service providers'' services. It supports current products and provides
    a basis for future product development in home electronic systems.'
