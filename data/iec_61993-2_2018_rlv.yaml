abstract:
- content: "IEC 61993-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br /><br />\r\nIEC 61993-2:2018
    specifies the minimum operational and performance requirements, methods of testing
    and required test results conforming to performance standards adopted by IMO in
    Resolution MSC.74(69):1998, Annex 3. This document incorporates the applicable
    technical characteristics of Class A shipborne equipment included in Recommendation
    ITU-R M.1371 and takes into account the ITU Radio Regulations, where applicable.
    In addition, it takes account of IMO Resolution A.694(17) to which IEC 60945 is
    associated. When a requirement in this document is different from IEC 60945, the
    requirement of this document takes precedence. This document also specifies the
    minimum requirements both for the means to input and display data and for the
    interfaces to other equipment suitable to be used as means of input and display
    data. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    it incorporates the technical characteristics included in Recommendation ITU R
    M.1371-5:2014;<br />\r\nb) it introduces the concept of locating device groups
    in order to include EPIRB AIS and MOB AIS in addition to AIS SART;<br />\r\nc)
    it adds security features for configuration input by introducing a new sentence
    SSA;<br />\r\nd) it adds optional implementation of IEC 61162-450/460 interfaces;<br
    />\r\ne) it adds requirements for bridge alert management (BAM);<br />\r\nf) it
    introduces extended dimension values used by towing vessels;<br />\r\ng) it adds
    a software update requirement."
