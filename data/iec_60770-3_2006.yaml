abstract:
- content: specifies the methods for reviewing the functionality and the degree of
    intelligence in intelligent transmitters, for testing the operational behaviour,
    as well as the static and dynamic performance of an intelligent transmitter as
    well as methodologies for determining the reliability and diagnostic features
    used to detect malfunctions; and determining the communication capabilities of
    the intelligent transmitters in a communication network.
