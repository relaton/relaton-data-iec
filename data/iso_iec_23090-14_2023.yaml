abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies extensions to existing scene
    description formats in order to support MPEG media, in particular immersive media.
    MPEG media includes but is not limited to media encoded with MPEG codecs, media
    stored in MPEG containers, MPEG media and application formats as well as media
    provided through MPEG delivery mechanisms. Extensions include scene description
    format syntax and semantics and the processing model when using these extensions
    by a Presentation Engine. It also defines a Media Access Function (MAF) API for
    communication between the Presentation Engine and the Media Access Function for
    these extensions. While the extensions defined in this document can be applicable
    to other scene description formats, they are provided for ISO/IEC 12113.</p>
