abstract:
- content: "IEC 63002:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 63002:2025 defines common
    charging interoperability guidelines for power sources (external power supplies
    (EPSs) and other Sources) used with computing and consumer electronics devices
    that implement IEC 62680‑1‑3 (USB Type-C® Cable and Connector Specification).
    This document defines normative requirements for an EPS to ensure interoperability;
    in particular, it specifies the data communicated from a power source to a device
    and certain safety elements of the EPS, cable, and device. While the requirements
    focus of this document is on the EPS and the behaviour at its USB Type-C connector
    interface, it is also important to comprehend cable assembly and device capabilities
    and behaviours in order to assure end-to-end charging interoperability. This document
    does not apply to all design aspects of an EPS. This document does not specify
    regulatory compliance requirements for aspects such as product safety, EMC, or
    energy efficiency. This document provides recommendations for the behaviour of
    a device when used with a power source compliant with this document. It specifies
    the minimum hardware specification for an EPS implementing IEC 62680‑1‑3. This
    document also specifies the data objects used by a charging system utilizing IEC
    62680‑1‑2 to understand the identity, design and performance characteristics,
    and operating status of an external power supply. IEC 62680‑1‑2 focuses on power
    delivery applications ranging to 240 W for a variety of computing and consumer
    electronics devices including notebook computers, tablets, smartphones, small
    form-factor desktops, monitor displays and other multimedia devices. This document
    relies on established mechanical and electrical specifications, and communication
    protocols specified by IEC 62680‑1‑2 and IEC 62680‑1‑3. These specifications support
    methods for establishing the best performing interoperability between untested
    combinations of EPS and devices with the aim of improving consumer satisfaction.
    Information describing the USB charging interoperability model, overview of USB
    Type-C and USB Power Delivery specifications, and factors for charging performance
    are also provided to support implementation of this document. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2021. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) power range
    is increased to 240 W;<br />\r\nb) AVS mode is introduced;<br />\r\nc) Annex A
    updates issues of arbitrary combinations of AC adapter and device;<br />\r\nd)
    Annex B describes new safeguards for EPR mode;<br />\r\ne) Annex C and Annex D
    are updated.</p>"
