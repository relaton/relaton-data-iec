    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 7816 specifies the power, signal structures, and the structure for the answer to reset between</p>
    <p>an integrated circuit(s) card with synchronous transmission and an interface device such as a terminal.</p>
    <p>The specifications in ISO/IEC 7816-3 apply where appropriate, unless otherwise stated here.</p>
    <p>It also covers signal rates, operating conditions, and communication with the integrated circuit(s) card.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 7816 specifies two types of synchronous cards: type 1 and type 2.</p>
