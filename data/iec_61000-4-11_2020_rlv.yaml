abstract:
- content: "IEC 61000-4-11:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-11:2020
    defines the immunity test methods and range of preferred test levels for electrical
    and electronic equipment connected to low-voltage power supply networks for voltage
    dips, short interruptions, and voltage variations. This document applies to electrical
    and electronic equipment having a rated input current not exceeding 16 A per phase,
    for connection to 50 Hz or 60 Hz AC networks. It does not apply to electrical
    and electronic equipment for connection to 400 Hz AC networks. Tests for these
    networks will be covered by future IEC documents. The object of this document
    is to establish a common reference for evaluating the immunity of electrical and
    electronic equipment when subjected to voltage dips, short interruptions and voltage
    variations.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Voltage fluctuation immunity tests are covered by
    IEC 61000-4-14. The test method documented in this document describes a consistent
    method to assess the immunity of equipment or a system against a defined phenomenon.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 2 As described in IEC Guide 107, this is a basic EMC publication for
    use by product committees of the IEC. As also stated in Guide 107, the IEC product
    committees are responsible for determining whether this immunity test standard
    should be applied or not, and, if applied, they are responsible for defining the
    appropriate test levels. Technical committee 77 and its sub-committees are prepared
    to co-operate with product committees in the evaluation of the value of particular
    immunity tests for their products. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2004 and Amendment 1:2017. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- rise time and fall time
    of transients are now defined terms in Clause 3;<br />\r\n- the origin of voltage
    dips and short interruptions is now stated in Clause 4.<br />\r\nKeywords: immunity
    test methods, low-voltage power supply networks<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of May 2020 and October 2022 have been included in this copy."
