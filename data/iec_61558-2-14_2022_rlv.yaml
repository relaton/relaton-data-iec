    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-14:2022
    deals with the safety of variable transformers for general applications and power
    supply units incorporating variable transformers for general applications. Transformers
    incorporating electronic circuits are also covered by this document. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- adjustment
    of structure and references in accordance with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\n- description
    of constructions moved to IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\n- new symbols for power supply
    units with linearly regulated output voltages and required current collector position
    changes.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104."
