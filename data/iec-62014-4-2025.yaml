  content: "IEC 62014-4:2025 describes an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) schema
    for meta-data documenting intellectual property (IP) used in the development,
    implementation, and verification of electronic systems. This schema provides both
    a standard method to document IP that is compatible with automated integration
    techniques and a standard method (generators) for linking tools into a system
    development framework, enabling a more flexible, optimized development environment.
    Tools compliant with this standard will be able to interpret, configure, integrate,
    and manipulate IP blocks that comply with the IP meta-data description. The standard
    is independent of any specific design processes. It does not cover behavioral
    characteristics of the IP that are not relevant to integration. This standard
    enables the creation and exchange of IP in a highly automated design environment.<br
    />\r\nThis standard is published as a double logo IEC-IEEE standard."
