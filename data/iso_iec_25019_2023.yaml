abstract:
- content: "This document defines a quality-in-use model composed of three characteristics
    (which are further subdivided into sub-characteristics) that can influence stakeholders
    when products or systems are used in a specified context of use. This model is
    applicable to the entire spectrum of information system and IT service system,
    including both computer systems in use and software products in use.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides a set of quality characteristics for specifying, measuring,
    evaluating and improving quality-in-use.<br />\r\nIn this document, because context
    of use is specified as prerequisite of quality-in-use, context of use is necessary
    to be re-specified to change prerequisite when a product or service intend to
    fulfil to context of use changes.<br />\r\nThe model can be applied, in particular,
    by those responsible for specifying and evaluating software product quality, such
    as developers, acquirers, quality assurance and control staff, and independent
    evaluators. Activities during product development that can benefit from the use
    of the quality model can include, but are not limited to:<br />\r\n- identifying
    requirements for information system and IT service system in use;<br />\r\n- validating
    the comprehensiveness of a quality-in-use requirements specification;<br />\r\n-
    identifying information system and IT service system design objectives for quality-in-use;<br
    />\r\n- identifying quality-in-use control criteria as part of overall quality
    assurance;<br />\r\n- identifying acceptance criteria for information system and
    IT service system or information systems;<br />\r\n- establishing measures to
    address the consequences of using products in specified context-of -use;<br />\r\n-
    presenting evaluation items for ethics considerations when using information system
    and IT service system;<br />\r\n- supporting governance of digitalization activities."
