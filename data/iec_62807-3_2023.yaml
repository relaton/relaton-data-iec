abstract:
- content: "IEC 62807-3:2023 is a sectional specification for outdoor hybrid communication
    cables intended to be used externally in various applications. It specifies terms,
    definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms, the design and construction, rated
    values and characteristics, performance requirements and test methods, packaging
    and quality assurance.<br />\r\nHybrid cables are designed for networks and customer
    premises cabling that transmit data, telecommunication, instrumentation, control
    and signalling services over optical fibres and/or broadband data over coaxial
    element, wire/pair/quad element and can have the option of supplying electrical
    current to a remote equipment.<br />\r\nIn the IEC 62807 series, the current carrying
    elements are used only to supply power to the equipment within the communication
    network. They are not used for electricity distribution or transmission, nor for
    power supply to domestic appliances. The specific uses are defined in the relevant
    specification.<br />\r\nThe relationship between each of the MICE classifications
    in ISO/IEC 11801-1, performance requirements and test methods of hybrid cables
    being proposed in a specific application are fully considered and aligned."
