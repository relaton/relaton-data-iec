  content: "IEC/TR 62649:2010(E) is relevant to the measurement and specification
    of ultrasound fields intended for medical therapeutic purposes. Lithotripsy and
    physiotherapy are excluded, since there are existing International Standards for
    these applications. IEC/TR 62649:2010 establishes:<br />\r\n- topics where there
    is a consensus that the development of International Standards would benefit the
    industries and/or patients;<br />\r\n- topics where the writing of standards should
    start immediately;<br />\r\n- topics where the writing of technical specifications
    should start immediately in order to gain practical experience and establish consensus
    prior to standardisation;<br />\r\n- topics which require future standardisation
    but where further research is required before initiating the writing of standards
    or technical specifications. IEC/TR 62649:2010 addresses primarily the requirements
    for measurement standards related to high intensity therapeutic ultrasound (HITU)
    [also known as high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)] fields which are both
    high intensity and focused and where the main mechanism for action is thermal.
    However, aspects of the discussion, conclusions and any resulting standards or
    technical specifications may also be relevant to therapeutic applications which
    are either focused or high intensity or where the main mechanism is not thermal.
    Scientific literature has been reviewed and responses to a questionnaire which
    was sent to experts around the world are reported."
