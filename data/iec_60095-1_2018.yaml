abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC 60095-1:2018 is available as IEC 60095-1:2018 RLV which
    contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all changes
    of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC 60095-1:2018 is
    applicable to lead-acid batteries with a nominal voltage of 12 V, used primarily
    as a power source for the starting of internal combustion engines, lighting, and
    for auxiliary equipment of internal combustion engine vehicles. These batteries
    are commonly called \"starter batteries\".<br />\r\nThis document is applicable
    to batteries for the following purposes:<br />\r\n• batteries for passenger cars;<br
    />\r\n• batteries for commercial and industrial vehicles.<br />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018
    is not applicable to batteries for other purposes, such as the starting of railcar
    internal combustion engines or for motorcycles and other power sport vehicles.
    IEC 60095-1:2018 defines many general properties of lead-acid batteries. Single
    sections can be referenced in other parts of the IEC 60095 series even if the
    application is excluded in the scope of this document. This document specifies
    the:<br />\r\n• general requirements;<br />\r\n• essential functional characteristics,
    relevant test methods and results required,<br />\r\nfor several classes of starter
    batteries:<br />\r\n• according to the general type of application;<br />\r\n•
    according to the type of product.<br />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018 cancels and replaces
    the seventh edition published in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) charge acceptance test;<br />\r\nb) cranking
    performance test;<br />\r\nc) charge retention test; and<br />\r\nd) endurance
    test added."
