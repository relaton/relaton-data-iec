- language: en

  content: 'Defines a test description language that: Facilitates the transfer of
    large volumes of digital test vector data from CAE environments to automated test
    equipment ATE environments; Specifies pattern, format, and timing information
    sufficient to define the application of digital test vectors to a device under
    test (DUT); Supports the volume of test vector data generated from structured
    tests such as scan/automatic test pattern generation (ATPG), integral test techniques
    such as built-in self test (BIST), and functional test specifications for IC designs
    and their assemblies, in a format optimized for application in ATE environments.'
