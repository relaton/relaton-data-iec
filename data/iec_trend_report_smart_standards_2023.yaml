abstract:
- content: "The report emphasizes the need for an evolution in standards to meet market
    expectations in the near future. It notes that the growing complexity of products
    forces manufacturers to use a greater number of standards, which themselves become
    increasingly complex. Businesses needing solutions, believe the answer lies in
    digitalization.<br /><br />\r\nSmart Standards are “the key enabler” through which
    the digital transformation of industries and society can be realized.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe report urges the IEC and its partners to develop digitally enabled standards
    that are machine-applicable, readable and transferable (Smart).<br /><br />\r\nIt
    provides an economic analysis of the value of Smart Standards for end users and
    for the IEC. Three main benefits emerge – better performance, lower risk and future
    value through assurance of income by operating better in dynamic markets.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe report presents Smart Standards from a technical, market and economic
    perspective. Smart Standards will introduce new market-driven, innovative services
    that nudge standardization organizations toward changing into service organizations,
    providing products based on software operating at different levels of digitalization.<br
    /><br />\r\nIt concludes with a set of considerations for the IEC Community.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology trend report was developed by the
    Societal and Technology Trend Working Group (STTWG) in the IEC Market Strategy
    Board (MSB). It complements the activities being conducted within the Standardization
    Management Board (SMB) and the Joint IEC/ISO task force."
