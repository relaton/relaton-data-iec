abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15149:2011 specifies the physical layer and media access control
    layer protocols of a wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency
    band (~300 kHz), for wireless communication in harsh environments (i.e. around
    metal, underwater, underground, etc.).</p><p>The physical layer protocol is designed
    for the following scope:</p><ul><li>low carrier frequency for large magnetic field
    area and reliable communication in harsh environments;</li><li>simple and robust
    modulation for a low implementation cost and error performance;</li><li>variable
    coding and bandwidth for a link adaptation.</li></ul><p>The media access control
    layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p><ul><li>simple and efficient
    network topology for low power consumption;</li><li>variable superframe structure
    for compact and efficient data transmission;</li><li>dynamic address assignment
    for small packet size and efficient address management.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 15149:2011
    supports several kbps data transmission in a wireless network within a distance
    of several metres. It can be applied to various services such as the following
    areas:</p><ul><li>in the environmental industry, to manage pollution levels in
    soil and water using wireless underground or underwater sensors;</li><li>in the
    construction industry, to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using
    wireless, inner-corrosion sensors;</li><li>in the consumer-electronics industry,
    to detect food spoilage in wet, airtight storage areas and to transfer the sensing
    data from the inside to the outside;</li><li>in the agricultural industry, to
    manage the moisture level as well as mineral status in soil using buried wireless
    sensors;</li><li>in the transportation industry, to manage road conditions and
    traffic information using wireless underground sensors.</li></ul>"
