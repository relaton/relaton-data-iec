abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15149:2011 specifies the physical layer and media access control
    layer protocols of a wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency
    band (~300 kHz), for wireless communication in harsh environments (i.e. around
    metal, underwater, underground, etc.).<br /><br />\r\nThe physical layer protocol
    is designed for the following scope:<br />\r\n\tlow carrier frequency for large
    magnetic field area and reliable communication in harsh environments;<br />\r\n\tsimple
    and robust modulation for a low implementation cost and error performance;<br
    />\r\n\tvariable coding and bandwidth for a link adaptation.<br /><br /><br /><br
    /><br />\r\nThe media access control layer protocol is designed for the following
    scope:<br />\r\n\tsimple and efficient network topology for low power consumption;<br
    />\r\n\tvariable superframe structure for compact and efficient data transmission;<br
    />\r\n\tdynamic address assignment for small packet size and efficient address
    management.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15149:2011 supports several
    kbps data transmission in a wireless network within a distance of several metres.
    It can be applied to various services such as the following areas:<br />\r\n\tin
    the environmental industry, to manage pollution levels in soil and water using
    wireless underground or underwater sensors;<br />\r\n\tin the construction industry,
    to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using wireless, inner-corrosion
    sensors;<br />\r\n\tin the consumer-electronics industry, to detect food spoilage
    in wet, airtight storage areas and to transfer the sensing data from the inside
    to the outside;<br />\r\n\tin the agricultural industry, to manage the moisture
    level as well as mineral status in soil using buried wireless sensors;<br />\r\n\tin
    the transportation industry, to manage road conditions and traffic information
    using wireless underground sensors.<br /><br /><br />"
