abstract:
- content: IEC 62951-8:2023 (E) defines terms and specifies the test method for evaluating
    the stretchability, flexibility, and stability of flexible resistive memory. The
    test method descriptions include experimental procedures and the equipment to
    be used. It also includes general requirements for test conditions such as the
    temperature and relative humidity of the testing environment. The test method
    described in this document focuses on stability evaluation rather than reliability.
