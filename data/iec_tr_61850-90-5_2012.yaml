abstract:
- content: 'IEC/TR 61850-90-5:2012(E) provides a way of exchanging synchrophasor data
    between PMUs, PDCs WAMPAC (Wide Area Monitoring, Protection, and Control), and
    between control center applications. The data, to the extent covered in IEEE C37.118-2005,
    are transported in a way that is compliant to the concepts of IEC 61850. However,
    given the primary scope and use cases, this document also provides routable profiles
    for IEC 61850-8-1 GOOSE and IEC 61850-9-2 SV packets. These routable packets can
    be utilized to transport general IEC 61850 data as well as synchrophasor data.
    Keywords: communication network, power utility, synchrophasor.'
