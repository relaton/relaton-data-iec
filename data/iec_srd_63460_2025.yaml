abstract:
- content: IEC SRD 63460:2025 The scope of this document is the assessment of how
    Electric Vehicles (EVs) may (or must) act as Distributed Energy Resources (DER)
    when they are interconnected to the electric power system through a charging station.
    Although clearly the main purpose for EV interconnection to the grid is to charge
    their batteries, EVs are capable of providing grid support functions while interconnected,
    and in some situations, may be mandated or incentivized to do so. This document
    provides Use Cases as examples of how EVs might provide such DER functionality,
    based on the grid support functions defined in IEC 61850-7-420, IEEE 1547:2018,
    and EN 50549.
