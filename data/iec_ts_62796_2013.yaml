abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62693:2013(E) is applicable to industrial electroheating installations
    using electric energy as input, alone or in combination with other kinds of energy.
    However, external combustible fuel energy input is not dealt with, and all considerations
    begin at the electric only mains frequency source to which the installation is
    connected. Any external voltage transformation from the supply network to the
    plant into a special voltage which is fed into the installation is not dealt with
    in this Technical Specification, since it is not considered a responsibility of
    the manufacturer of the installation.
