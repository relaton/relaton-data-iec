  content: "IEC 60669-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis part of
    IEC 60669 applies to manually operated general purpose functional switches, for
    alternating current (AC) only with a rated voltage not exceeding 440 V with a
    rated current not exceeding 63 A, intended for household and similar fixed electrical
    installations, either indoors or outdoors.<br />\r\nFor switches provided with
    screwless terminals, the rated current is limited to 16 A.<br />\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 1998, Amendment 1:1999
    and Amendment 2:2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) change of the scope for motor load switches;<br
    />\r\nb) deletion of some dated normative references;<br />\r\nc) changes to the
    definitions;<br />\r\nd) in Clause 5 the number of specimens to be used for the
    tests are clearly given in Table 1 (Corresponding Annex A of IEC 60669-1:1998
    was therefore deleted);<br />\r\ne) in Clause 5 it was clarified on which switches
    the tests of Clause 19 shall be carried out;<br />\r\nf) requirements concerning
    13 A switches have been included;<br />\r\ng) mandatory indication that a terminal
    is suitable for rigid conductor only;<br />\r\nh) requirements and test conditions
    for flexible conductors have been included in Clause 12;<br />\r\ni) requirements
    for pilot light units have been included;<br />\r\nj) new test for self-ballasted
    lamp loads in 19.3;<br />\r\nk) Table 20 has been completely redrawn to cover
    normal, mini and micro-gap switches and renumbered Table 21;<br />\r\nl) new informative
    Annex B including changes planned for the future in order to align IEC 60669-1
    with the requirements of IEC 60998 (all parts), IEC 60999 (all parts) and IEC
    60228;<br />\r\nm) new informative Annex C about the circuit development for 19.3;<br
    />\r\nn) new informative Annex D including additional requirements for insulation-piercing
    terminals;<br />\r\no) new informative Annex E including additional requirements
    and tests for switches intended to be used at a temperature lower than -5 °C.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of January 2020 have been included in this
    copy.<br />\r\nKey words: Home switches, fixed electrical installation"
