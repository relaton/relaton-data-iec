  content: "IEC 62135-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62135-2:2020 is applicable
    to equipment for resistance welding and allied processes which are connected to
    mains supplies with rated voltages up to 1 000 V AC RMS. This document does not
    define safety requirements. This third edition cancels and replaces the second
    edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- update of the applicable limits related to the updated
    references;<br />\r\n- implementation of radiated magnetic field requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol
