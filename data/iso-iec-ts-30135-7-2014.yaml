    <p>EPUB® documents, unlike print books or PDF files, are designed to change. The content flows, or reflows, to fit</p>
    <p>the screen and to fit the needs of the reader. The EPUB 3.0 Specification says that "content presentation should</p>
    <p>adapt to the user rather than the user having to adapt to a particular representation of content."</p>
    <p>But this principle doesn't work for all types of documents. Sometimes content and design are so intertwined</p>
    <p>they cannot be separated. Any change in appearance risks changing the meaning, or losing all meaning. <i>Fixedlayout</i></p>
    <p><i>documents </i>give content creators greater control over presentation, when a reflowable EPUB is not</p>
    <p>suitable for the content.</p>
    <p>This document, EPUB 3 Fixed-Layout Documents, defines a set of metadata properties to allow declarative</p>
    <p>expression of intended rendering behaviors of fixed-layout documents in the context of EPUB 3. It also defines</p>
    <p>mechanisms to express the intended rendering dimensions of fixed-layout XHTML and SVG [ContentDocs30]</p>
    <p>content, as well as bitmap images.</p>
