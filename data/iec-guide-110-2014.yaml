  content: "IEC GUIDE 110:2014 provides background information to technical committees
    when dealing with safety requirements for products intended to be integrated in
    a home control system. It includes information on functional safety as well as
    conventional safety aspects relevant to home control systems. This Guide deals
    with home control systems providing control communication for equipment used within
    homes. This includes the control of equipment for cooling, heating, lighting,
    audio/video, telecommunications, security, etc., in fact, any equipment controlled
    by the home control system. It also includes residential gateways between the
    internal home control system network and external wide-area networks such as the
    internet. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br
    />\r\n- addition of several new electrical safety aspects;<br />\r\n- inclusion
    of cyber security;<br />\r\n- consistent use of the term \"equipment\" to replace
    terms such as \"device\", \"system\", \"product\", etc.."
