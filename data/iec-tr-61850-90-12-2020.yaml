  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-12:2020, which is a Technical Report, is intended for
    an audience familiar with electrical power automation based on IEC 61850 and related
    power system management, and particularly for data network engineers and system
    integrators. It is intended to help them to understand the technologies, configure
    a wide area network, define requirements, write specifications, select components,
    and conduct tests.<br />\r\nThis document provides definitions, guidelines, and
    recommendations for the engineering of WANs, in particular for protection, control
    and monitoring based on IEC 61850 and related standards.<br />\r\nThis document
    addresses substation-to-substation communication, substation-to-control centre,
    and control centre-to-control centre communication. In particular, this document
    addresses the most critical aspects of IEC 61850 such as protection related data
    transmission via GOOSE and SMVs, and the multicast transfer of large volumes of
    synchrophasor data.<br />\r\nThe document addresses issues such as topology, redundancy,
    traffic latency and quality of service, traffic management, clock synchronization,
    security, and maintenance of the network.<br />\r\nThis document contains use
    cases that show how utilities tackle their WAN engineering. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) extension
    of use case with respect to distribution and customer-side applications;<br />\r\nb)
    extensions of wireless access technologies as well as power line communication
    ones applicable to the above-mentioned use case;<br />\r\nc) revisions regarding
    radio communication technology performance;<br />\r\nd) extension of network migration
    with respect to packet switched network;<br />\r\ne) a new mapping of multiprotocol
    label switching technology to teleprotection."
