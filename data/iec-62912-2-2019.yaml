  content: "IEC 62912-2:2019 gives requirements for direct current relays intended
    for safety-related applications in railway signalling installations.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to non-proved signalling monostable relays of the spring
    type, whose return force is generated by elasticity of spring.<br />\r\nThe return
    force can be provided either from a separate spring and/or from the contact springs
    themselves."
