  content: "IEC 60335-2-7:2008 RLV contains the International Standard and its Redline
    version. The Redline version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between this standard and its previous edition. The Redline version
    is not an official IEC Standard, only the current version of the standard is to
    be considered the official document.<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-7:2008 deals with the
    safety of electric washing machines for household and similar use, that are intended
    for washing clothes and textiles, their rated voltage being not more than 250
    V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances. This standard also
    deals with the safety of electric washing machines for household and similar use
    employing an electrolyte instead of detergent. Additional requirements for these
    appliances are given in Annex CC."
