abstract:
- content: "IEC 61108-6:2023 specifies the minimum performance requirements, methods
    of testing and required test results for the Indian regional satellite system
    (IRNSS) shipborne receiver equipment, based on IMO resolution MSC.449(99), which
    uses the signals from IRNSS in order to determine position.<br />\r\nThis document
    takes account of the general requirements given in IMO resolution A.694(17) and
    is associated with IEC 60945. When a requirement in this document is different
    from IEC 60945, the requirement in this document takes precedence. This document
    also takes into account, as appropriate, requirements for the presentation of
    navigation-related information on shipborne navigational displays given in IMO
    resolution MSC.191(79) and is associated with IEC 62288. This document further
    takes into account, as appropriate, requirements for bridge alert management given
    in IMO resolution MSC.302(87) and is associated with IEC 62923-1.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to navigation in ocean waters for the standard positioning service
    and harbour entrances, harbour approaches and coastal waters, as defined in IMO
    resolution A.1046(27) within IRNSS/NavIC coverage area."
