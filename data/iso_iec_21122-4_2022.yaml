abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21122-4:2022 This document specifies the framework, concepts,
    methodology for testing, and criteria to be achieved to claim conformance to multiple
    parts of the ISO/IEC 21122 series. It lists the conformance testing procedures.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies:<br />\r\n- Conformance testing procedures for decoders
    implementing ISO/IEC 21122-1.<br />\r\n- Tests to check which conformance point
    an ISO/IEC 21122-1 decoder conforms to, that is, whether a decoder satisfies the
    error bounds required for strict or relaxed conformance.<br />\r\n- Conformance
    testing procedures for decoders implementing ISO/IEC 21122-3.<br />\r\n- Tests
    to check codestreams for conformance to ISO/IEC 21122-1. As such, it provides
    means to test whether encoder implementations generate syntactically correct codestreams,
    and whether codestreams generated by such implementations follow the requirements
    of a particular profile, level and sublevel, and the buffer model implied by them.<br
    />\r\n- Tests to check files for conformance to ISO/IEC 21122-3.<br />\r\n- Conformance
    testing procedures that allow testing whether codestreams conform to any of the
    profiles specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2.<br />\r\n- Conformance testing procedures
    that allow testing whether codestreams conform to the buffer model specified in
    ISO/IEC 21122-2 as part of a profile, level and sublevel.<br />\r\n- Codestreams,
    decoded images, and error metrics to be used within the decoder testing procedures.<br
    />\r\n- A buffer model test.<br />\r\n- Abstract test suites.<br />\r\nNOTE: This
    document does not specify:<br />\r\n- Testing the reconstruction of a full resolution
    image from a subsampled image format. In particular, upsampling from 4:2:2 or
    4:2:0 to 4:4:4 sampling is a non-normative extension and as such its testing is
    beyond the scope of this document.<br />\r\n- Testing the conversion of the sample
    values reconstructed by an ISO/IEC 21122-3 decoder to the target colour space
    by means of the colour specification box of ISO/IEC 21122-3.<br />\r\n- Testing
    of the composition of background and foreground for images reconstructed from
    ISO/IEC 21122-3 files or codestreams that contain auxiliary channels carrying
    opacity information.<br />\r\n- Testing of the interpolation of a colour filter
    array image to a full scale colour image; this process is not normatively defined
    and beyond the scope of this document.<br />\r\n- Acceptance testing: the process
    of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance criteria and enables
    the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation. This includes
    the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g. functionality, quality,
    and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation satisfies
    the user requirements.<br />\r\n- Performance testing: measures the performance
    characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT) such as its throughput,
    responsiveness, etc. under various conditions.<br />\r\n- Robustness testing:
    the process of determining how well an implementation is able to conceal problems
    from attempting to reconstruct an image from an ill-formed codestream."
