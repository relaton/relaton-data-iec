abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the framework, concepts, methodology for testing,
    and criteria to be achieved to claim conformance to multiple parts of the ISO/IEC
    21122 series. It lists the conformance testing procedures.</p><p>This document
    specifies:</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures for decoders implementing ISO/IEC
    21122-1.</p><p>— Tests to check which conformance point an ISO/IEC 21122-1 decoder
    conforms to, that is, whether a decoder satisfies the error bounds required for
    strict or relaxed conformance.</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures for decoders
    implementing ISO/IEC 21122-3.</p><p>— Tests to check codestreams for conformance
    to ISO/IEC 21122-1. As such, it provides means to test whether encoder implementations
    generate syntactically correct codestreams, and whether codestreams generated
    by such implementations follow the requirements of a particular profile, level
    and sublevel, and the buffer model implied by them.</p><p>— Tests to check files
    for conformance to ISO/IEC 21122-3.</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures that
    allow testing whether codestreams conform to any of the profiles specified in
    ISO/IEC 21122-2.</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures that allow testing whether
    codestreams conform to the buffer model specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2 as part of
    a profile, level and sublevel.</p><p>— Codestreams, decoded images, and error
    metrics to be used within the decoder testing procedures.</p><p>— A buffer model
    test.</p><p>— Abstract test suites.</p><p>NOTE: This document does not specify:</p><p>—
    Testing the reconstruction of a full resolution image from a subsampled image
    format. In particular, upsampling from 4:2:2 or 4:2:0 to 4:4:4 sampling is a non-normative
    extension and as such its testing is beyond the scope of this document.</p><p>—
    Testing the conversion of the sample values reconstructed by an ISO/IEC 21122-3
    decoder to the target colour space by means of the colour specification box of
    ISO/IEC 21122-3.</p><p>— Testing of the composition of background and foreground
    for images reconstructed from ISO/IEC 21122-3 files or codestreams that contain
    auxiliary channels carrying opacity information.</p><p>— Testing of the interpolation
    of a colour filter array image to a full scale colour image; this process is not
    normatively defined and beyond the scope of this document.</p><p>— Acceptance
    testing: the process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance
    criteria and enables the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation.
    This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g. functionality,
    quality, and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation
    satisfies the user requirements.</p><p>— Performance testing: measures the performance
    characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT) such as its throughput,
    responsiveness, etc. under various conditions.</p><p>— Robustness testing: the
    process of determining how well an implementation is able to conceal problems
    from attempting to reconstruct an image from an ill-formed codestream.</p>"
