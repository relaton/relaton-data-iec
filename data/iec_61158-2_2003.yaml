abstract:
- content: 'Fieldbus is a digital serial, multidrop, data bus for communication with
    low-level industrial control and instrumentation devices such as transducers,
    actuators and local controllers. The Physical Layer provides for transparent transmission
    of Data Link Layer entities across physical connections. Specifies the requirements
    for Fieldbus component parts. Also specifies the media and network configuration
    requirements necessary to ensure agreed levels of: a) data integrity before Data
    Link error checking; b) interoperability between devices at the Physical Layer.
    The contents of the corrigendum of July 2004 have been included in this copy.'
