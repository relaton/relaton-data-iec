abstract:
- content: IEC SRD 63233-1:2022 The smart city standards inventory and mapping project
    was initiated to provide a systematic approach to retrieve and map the standards
    of smart cities on smart city reference architectures, models or frameworks and
    provide fundamental support for the collaborative work of standard-setters and
    users. Standards maps are the practical base for helping SDOs and users to identify
    directly and instantly the standards that are needed for any aspects of smart
    cities (citizen services, city infrastructure, governance, etc.). Standards maps
    also help in identifying the standardization gap in the ecosystem.
