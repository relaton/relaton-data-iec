abstract:
- content: "IEC 60086-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60086-3:2016 specifies
    dimensions, designation, methods of tests and requirements for primary batteries
    for watches. In several cases, a menu of test methods is given. When presenting
    battery electrical characteristics and/or performance data, the manufacturer specifies
    which test method was used. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- A harmonization of the cell sizes and service output
    tests with IEC 60086-2;<br />\r\n- Clarifications of Clauses 6: Sampling and Quality
    Assurance, 7: Test methods, and 8: Visual examination and acceptance condition;<br
    />\r\n- Harmonization of temperature and humidity conditions with IEC 60086-1.
    This publication is published as a double logo standard.<br />\r\nKeywords: primary
    batteries for watches"
