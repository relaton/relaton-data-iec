- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 29143:2011 provides an
    air interface specification for Mobile radio frequency identification (RFID) interrogators
    being part of a passive backscatter system. This system comprises one or more
    mobile interrogators, also known as Mobile RFID interrogators, and an undefined
    number of tags, also known as labels.</p><p>Interrogators are not required to
    support channel sensing, i.e. do not need to implement Listen Before Talk (LBT),
    and transmit commands on the off chance under the risk of colliding with one or
    more peer-interrogators. Moreover, interrogators compliant to ISO/IEC 29143:2011
    are not obliged to synchronize by any means (wired or wireless), i.e. no control
    channel dedicated to coordinating Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) is provided.</p><p>Tags
    are powered by the RF signal provided by the interrogator and respond to an interrogator
    by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna, thereby backscattering
    data to the interrogator. The working mode adopted by the tags is purely passive,
    i.e. tags do not actively initiate any kind of RF communication.</p><p>In ISO/IEC
    29143:2011, collision arbitration and collision avoidance for Mobile RFID applications
    are defined by specifying methods aimed at mitigating the impact of emerging collisions
    and mechanisms used to avoid follow-up collisions.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29143:2011 applies
    to Mobile RFID interrogator devices used to inventory passive or semi-passive
    backscatter tags at 860 MHz to 960 MHz in a mobile (non-fixed) application independent
    from specific communication details, i.e. modulation technique and command set.</p><p>Furthermore,
    the scope of ISO/IEC 29143:2011 is mobile consumer applications, whereas mobile
    enterprise applications are not covered as long as operating in a closed environment.</p><p>An
    operating environment is considered to be closed if it belongs to a central administrative
    authority able to guarantee for sufficient isolation, i.e. preventing mobile enterprise
    interrogator devices from being used outside the dedicated operating environment,
    and if sufficient spatial separation and/or electromagnetic shielding from adjacent
    operating environments is provided.</p><p>An application is considered a consumer
    application if at least one of two interacting entities is a private individual
    (consumer) and the interaction is taking place in the public domain. Consequently,
    a Mobile RFID consumer application is defined as Mobile RFID equipment (e.g. mobile
    phones equipped with an RFID interrogator) being used in a consumer application.</p><p>NOTE
    As there is currently no active contribution on Mobile HF interrogators, ISO/IEC
    29143:2011 covers only UHF.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29143:2011 specifies</p><ul><li>Mobile
    RFID interrogator media access control,</li><li>interrogator to interrogator and
    multiple interrogator to tag collision arbitration scheme including interrogator
    requirements,</li><li>interrogator to interrogator and multiple interrogator to
    tag collision avoidance scheme, and</li><li>tag memory use for Mobile RFID applications.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    29143:2011 does not specify</p><ul><li>physical interactions (the signaling layer
    of the communication link) between interrogators and tags,</li><li>interrogator
    and tag operating procedures and commands, and</li><li>the collision arbitration
    algorithm used to singulate (separate to the current response slot) a specific
    tag in a multiple-tag environment.</li></ul><p>In particular, ISO/IEC 29143:2011
    does not replace any existing RFID air interface specification issued by ISO/IEC
    but extends the existing methodologies for fixed RFID interrogators with mechanisms
    addressing the special challenges of Mobile RFID. The concepts and mechanisms
    described in ISO/IEC 29143:2011 can be integrated in any existing RFID protocol
    approved by ISO/IEC for the given frequency range of 860 MHz to 960 MHz (unless
    explicitly prohibited by such protocol) regardless of the actual command set.</p><p>The
    mechanisms defined by ISO/IEC 29143:2011 can be used for Mobile RFID interrogators
    used in consumer applications and compliant to ISO/IEC 18000-6.</p>
