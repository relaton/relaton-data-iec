abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29143:2011 provides an air interface specification for Mobile radio
    frequency identification (RFID) interrogators being part of a passive backscatter
    system. This system comprises one or more mobile interrogators, also known as
    Mobile RFID interrogators, and an undefined number of tags, also known as labels.Interrogators
    are not required to support channel sensing, i.e. do not need to implement Listen
    Before Talk (LBT), and transmit commands on the off chance under the risk of colliding
    with one or more peer-interrogators. Moreover, interrogators compliant to ISO/IEC
    29143:2011 are not obliged to synchronize by any means (wired or wireless), i.e.
    no control channel dedicated to coordinating Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
    is provided.Tags are powered by the RF signal provided by the interrogator and
    respond to an interrogator by modulating the reflection coefficient of its antenna,
    thereby backscattering data to the interrogator. The working mode adopted by the
    tags is purely passive, i.e. tags do not actively initiate any kind of RF communication.In
    ISO/IEC 29143:2011, collision arbitration and collision avoidance for Mobile RFID
    applications are defined by specifying methods aimed at mitigating the impact
    of emerging collisions and mechanisms used to avoid follow-up collisions.ISO/IEC
    29143:2011 applies to Mobile RFID interrogator devices used to inventory passive
    or semi-passive backscatter tags at 860 MHz to 960 MHz in a mobile (non-fixed)
    application independent from specific communication details, i.e. modulation technique
    and command set.Furthermore, the scope of ISO/IEC 29143:2011 is mobile consumer
    applications, whereas mobile enterprise applications are not covered as long as
    operating in a closed environment.An operating environment is considered to be
    closed if it belongs to a central administrative authority able to guarantee for
    sufficient isolation, i.e. preventing mobile enterprise interrogator devices from
    being used outside the dedicated operating environment, and if sufficient spatial
    separation and/or electromagnetic shielding from adjacent operating environments
    is provided.An application is considered a consumer application if at least one
    of two interacting entities is a private individual (consumer) and the interaction
    is taking place in the public domain. Consequently, a Mobile RFID consumer application
    is defined as Mobile RFID equipment (e.g. mobile phones equipped with an RFID
    interrogator) being used in a consumer application.NOTE As there is currently
    no active contribution on Mobile HF interrogators, ISO/IEC 29143:2011 covers only
    UHF.ISO/IEC 29143:2011 specifiesMobile RFID interrogator media access control,interrogator
    to interrogator and multiple interrogator to tag collision arbitration scheme
    including interrogator requirements,interrogator to interrogator and multiple
    interrogator to tag collision avoidance scheme, andtag memory use for Mobile RFID
    applications.ISO/IEC 29143:2011 does not specifyphysical interactions (the signaling
    layer of the communication link) between interrogators and tags,interrogator and
    tag operating procedures and commands, andthe collision arbitration algorithm
    used to singulate (separate to the current response slot) a specific tag in a
    multiple-tag environment.In particular, ISO/IEC 29143:2011 does not replace any
    existing RFID air interface specification issued by ISO/IEC but extends the existing
    methodologies for fixed RFID interrogators with mechanisms addressing the special
    challenges of Mobile RFID. The concepts and mechanisms described in ISO/IEC 29143:2011
    can be integrated in any existing RFID protocol approved by ISO/IEC for the given
    frequency range of 860 MHz to 960 MHz (unless explicitly prohibited by such protocol)
    regardless of the actual command set.The mechanisms defined by ISO/IEC 29143:2011
    can be used for Mobile RFID interrogators used in consumer applications and compliant
    to ISO/IEC 18000-6.
