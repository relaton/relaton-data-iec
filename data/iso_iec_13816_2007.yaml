abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13816:2007 specifies syntax and semantics of the computer programming
    language ISLisp by specifying requirements for a conforming ISLisp processor and
    a conforming ISLisp text. The design goals for ISLisp are the following.</p><ol><li>ISLisp
    shall be compatible with existing Lisp dialects where feasible.</li><li>ISLisp
    shall have as a primary goal to provide basic functionality.</li><li>ISLisp shall
    be object-oriented.</li><li>ISLisp shall be designed with extensibility in mind.</li><li>ISLisp
    shall give priority to industrial needs over academic needs.</li><li>ISLisp shall
    promote efficient implementations and applications.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC 13816:2007
    does not specify:</p><ul><li>the size or complexity of an ISLisp text that exceeds
    the capacity of any specific data processing system or the capacity of a particular
    processor, nor the actions to be taken when the corresponding limits are exceeded;</li><li>the
    minimal requirements of a data processing system that is capable of supporting
    an implementation of a processor for ISLisp;</li><li>the method of preparation
    of an ISLisp text for execution and the method of activation of this ISLisp text,
    prepared for execution;</li><li>the typographical presentation of an ISLisp text
    published for human reading;</li><li>extensions that might or might not be provided
    by the implementation.</li></ul>"
