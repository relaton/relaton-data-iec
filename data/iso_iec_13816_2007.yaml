abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13816:2007 specifies syntax and semantics of the computer programming
    language ISLisp by specifying requirements for a conforming ISLisp processor and
    a conforming ISLisp text. The design goals for ISLisp are the following.</p>\n\nISLisp
    shall be compatible with existing Lisp dialects where feasible. \nISLisp shall
    have as a primary goal to provide basic functionality. \nISLisp shall be object-oriented.
    \nISLisp shall be designed with extensibility in mind. \nISLisp shall give priority
    to industrial needs over academic needs. \nISLisp shall promote efficient implementations
    and applications.<p>ISO/IEC 13816:2007 does not specify:</p>\n\nthe size or complexity
    of an ISLisp text that exceeds the capacity of any specific data processing system
    or the capacity of a particular processor, nor the actions to be taken when the
    corresponding limits are exceeded; \nthe minimal requirements of a data processing
    system that is capable of supporting an implementation of a processor for ISLisp;
    \nthe method of preparation of an ISLisp text for execution and the method of
    activation of this ISLisp text, prepared for execution; \nthe typographical presentation
    of an ISLisp text published for human reading; \nextensions that might or might
    not be provided by the implementation."
