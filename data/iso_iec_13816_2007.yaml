abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 13816:2007 specifies syntax and semantics of the computer programming
    language ISLisp by specifying requirements for a conforming ISLisp processor and
    a conforming ISLisp text. The design goals for ISLisp are the following. ISLisp
    shall be compatible with existing Lisp dialects where feasible. ISLisp shall have
    as a primary goal to provide basic functionality. ISLisp shall be object-oriented.
    ISLisp shall be designed with extensibility in mind. ISLisp shall give priority
    to industrial needs over academic needs. ISLisp shall promote efficient implementations
    and applications. ISO/IEC 13816:2007 does not specify: the size or complexity
    of an ISLisp text that exceeds the capacity of any specific data processing system
    or the capacity of a particular processor, nor the actions to be taken when the
    corresponding limits are exceeded; the minimal requirements of a data processing
    system that is capable of supporting an implementation of a processor for ISLisp;
    the method of preparation of an ISLisp text for execution and the method of activation
    of this ISLisp text, prepared for execution; the typographical presentation of
    an ISLisp text published for human reading; extensions that might or might not
    be provided by the implementation.'
