  content: "IEC TR 61850-90-17:2017(en) provides a way of exchanging power quality
    data between instruments whose functions include measuring, recording and possibly
    monitoring power quality phenomena in power supply systems, and clients using
    them in a way that is compliant to the concepts of IEC 61850. The main goal is
    the interoperability of power quality instruments. This document provides::<br
    />\r\n- Guidelines for using of IEC 61850 for power quality domain;<br />\r\n-
    Name space extensions based on power quality function assessment;<br />\r\n- Profile
    for using IEC 61850 in the specific context of IEC 61000-4-30."
