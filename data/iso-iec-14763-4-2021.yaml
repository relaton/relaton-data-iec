  content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 14763-4:2021 (E) specifies the measurement of two- and four-pair
    balanced cabling of</br>\r\na) end-to-end (E2E) link Class D, E and EA;</br>\r\nb)
    modular plug terminated links (MPTLs) of Class D, E, EA, F, FA and of Class I
    and II;</br>\r\nc) direct attach cabling of Class D, E, EA, F, FA and of Class
    I and II.</br>\r\nThe free connectors which terminate two and four pairs in field
    and laboratory conditions are included. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:</br>\r\n- measurement of the transmission performance
    of modular plug terminated link (MPTL) and direct attach cabling were added.</br>\r\n-
    Additional requirements of test head designs of E2E link were introduced.</br>\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum 1 (2022-09) have been included in this copy."
