abstract:
- content: "IEC 60115-4:2022(E) relates to resistors having a rated dissipation typically
    greater than 1 W up to and including 1 000 W for use in electronic equipment.
    This document is applicable to fixed power resistors with a maximum surface temperature
    (MET) higher than the preferred upper category temperature (UCT) of 200 °C.<br
    />\r\nNOTE Heat sink resistors, i.e. resistors which in their operation depend
    on being mounted on a dedicated heat sink, owing to their special temperature
    conditions, are covered by a special sectional specification (under consideration
    at the time of publication).<br />\r\nThese resistors are typically described
    according to types (different geometric shapes) and styles (different dimensions),
    and product technology.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is to define preferred
    ratings and characteristics and to select from IEC 60115-1 the appropriate quality
    assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance
    requirements for this type of resistor.<br />\r\nNOTE SMD resistors are covered
    by IEC 60115-8, regardless of their dissipation.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tthe
    definitions of product technologies and product classification levels of the generic
    specification, IEC 60115-1:2020, have been adopted;\r\n\ta basis for the optional
    specification of the lead eccentricity of axial leaded resistors has been amended
    in 4.2;\r\n\tthe 'period-pulse high-voltage overload test' of IEC 60115-1:2020,
    8.3 has been adopted as default test method in 5.3.9, thereby replacing the legacy
    test 'periodic-pulse overload test of IEC 60115-1:2020, 8.4;\r\n\tthe revised
    solderability test of IEC 60115-1:2020, 11.1 has been adopted in 5.3.22 and 5.3.23;\r\n\tthe
    combined solvent resistance test of IEC 60115-1:2020, 11.3 has been adopted in
    5.3.25;\r\n\tthe 'endurance at room temperature test' of IEC 60115-1:2020, 7.2
    has been reworked and adopted in 5.3.5;\r\n\tthe 'single-pulse high-voltage overload
    test' of IEC 60115-1:2020, 8.2, applied with the pulse shape 10/700 in 5.3.8,
    is complemented with the optional alternative provided by the pulse shape 1,2/50
    in 5.4.1.\r\n\tclimatic tests for 'operation at low temperature' of IEC 60115
    1:2020, 10.2, and for 'damp heat, steady state, accelerated' of IEC 60115‑1:2020,
    10.5, have been adopted as optional tests in 5.4.5. and 5.4.6, respectively;\r\n\tinclusion
    of an optional flammability test as 5.4.8;\r\n\tnew guidance is provided in 6.2
    on the presentation of stability requirements with their permissible absolute
    and relative deviations;\r\n\tacceptance criteria for the visual inspection have
    been added in 6.5 and in Annex B;\r\n\tvisual inspection for the primary and proximity
    packaging has been added in 6.5.3 and in 7.2;\r\n\tthe periodical evaluation of
    termination platings has been added as a new topic of quality assessment in 9.8;\r\n\tthe
    revised test clause numbering of IEC 60115-1:2020 has been applied;\r\n\ta new
    Annex C has been added to summarize workmanship requirements for the assembly
    of leaded power resistors, e.g. as given in the prior IEC 61192 series of standards;\r\n\tthe
    informative Annex F on radial formed styles has been amended with details on a
    formed Z-bend style for surface-mount assembly;\r\n\tfurthermore, the informative
    Annex X has been ad"
