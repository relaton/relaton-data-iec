abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides specifications for a transport
    format which enables the digital encapsulation of this data. This document refers
    to an encapsulation of hardware identification (HWID) data as a HWID tag, just
    as ISO/IEC 19770-2 refers to software identification (SWID) tags for software
    identification.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document applies to the following.</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->Tag
    producers: organizations that create HWID tags for use by others in the market.
    A tag producer can be part of the organization creating the hardware or a third-party
    organization. These organizations can be broken down into two major categories.</p><p
    class="MsoListContinue2" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->Device
    or component providers: entities responsible for the manufacturing or creation
    of the hardware device and/or associated operating system, virtual environment,
    or application platform. Platform providers which support this document can additionally
    provide tag management capabilities at the level of the platform or operating
    system.</p><p class="MsoListContinue2" style="mso-list: l1 level1 lfo2;"><!--
    [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->Tag tool providers: entities that provide tools
    to create hardware identification tags. For example, tools within development
    environments that generate hardware identification tags, or installation tools
    that can create tags on behalf of the installation process, and/or desktop management
    tools that can create tags for underlying hardware, virtual machines, or platforms
    that did not originally have a hardware identification tag.</p><p class="ListContinue1"
    style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->Tag
    consumers: tools and/or organizations who utilize information from HWID tags are
    broken down into the following two major categories.</p><p class="MsoListContinue2"

    or component consumers: entities that purchase, install, integrate, and/or otherwise
    deploy physical or virtual hardware or components.</p><p class="MsoListContinue2"

    and processing tool providers: entities that provide tools to collect, store,
    and process hardware identification tags. These tools may be targeted at a variety
    of different market segments, including security, asset management, and logistics.</p><p

    identification.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document does not detail information
    technology asset management (ITAM) processes required for discovery and management
    of hardware (which is provided in ISO/IEC 19770-1) software identification tags
