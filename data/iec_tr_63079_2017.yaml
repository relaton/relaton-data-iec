abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63079:2017(E) gives recommendations for and guidance on the design,
    planning, installation, testing, operation and maintenance of a hearing-loop system
    (HLS) intended for communicating speech, music and/or other signals. It is mainly
    concerned with HLS for hearing enhancement, in which the signals are communicated
    to users of hearing aids equipped with magnetic pick-up coils.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not apply to induction-loop systems which use a carrier frequency, nor to
    other systems for hearing enhancement purposes which do not use magnetic induction."
