  content: IEC 62824:2016(E) which is a Technical Report provides information on selection
    and efficient use of materials in electrical and electronic products. Environmentally
    conscious design (ECD) can then proceed in such a way that aspects, including
    material type, material quantity, material substitutability, renewable material,
    material recyclability, material recoverability, and durability of product are
    taken into account during the design phase.
