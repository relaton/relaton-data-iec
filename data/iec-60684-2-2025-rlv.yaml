  content: "IEC 60684-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60684-2:2025 gives methods
    of test for flexible insulating sleeving, including heat-shrinkable sleeving,
    intended primarily for insulating electrical conductors and connections of electrical
    apparatus, although they can be used for other purposes. The tests specified are
    designed to control the quality of the sleeving but it is recognized that they
    do not completely establish the suitability of sleeving for impregnation or encapsulation
    processes or for other specialized applications. Where necessary, the test methods
    in this document will be supplemented by appropriate impregnation or compatibility
    tests to suit the individual circumstances. This fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2011.This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) major update of normative references;<br
    />\r\nb) revision of Clause 5, with amendment of methods for measurements of bore
    and wall thickness;<br />\r\nc) revision of Clause 11, to clarify that the longitudinal
    change test is done on expanded sleeving;<br />\r\nd) revision of Clause 28, additional
    method D for flame propagation testing;<br />\r\ne) revision of Clause 56, additional
    method for preparation of samples for adhesive peel test;<br />\r\nf) addition
    of Clause 63, abrasion test method;<br />\r\ng) addition of Clause 64, volume
    resistivity for semi-conducting materials;<br />\r\nh) addition of Clause 65,
    outgassing;<br />\r\ni) addition of Clause 66, resistance to weathering.</p>"
