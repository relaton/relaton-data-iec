  content: IEC TR 62970:2016(E) provides guidance for carrying out round robin tests
    (RRT) and hence for the determination of levels of repeatability (intra-laboratory
    variability) and reproducibility (inter-laboratory variability) for household
    and similar electrical appliances. This document can also be used to verify the
    measurement methods, to improve the measurement method, and to qualify laboratories.
    It is not applicable for the determination of production variation for a particular
    product. General advice on proficiency testing of laboratories is given in ISO/IEC
    17043. This document can be used in addition to ISO/IEC 17043.
