  content: "IEC 61162-460:2024 is an add-on to IEC 61162-450 where higher safety and
    security standards are needed, for example due to higher exposure to external
    threats or to improve network integrity. This document provides requirements and
    test methods for equipment to be used in an IEC 61162-460 compliant network as
    well as requirements for the network itself and requirements for interconnection
    from the network to other networks. This document also contains requirements for
    a redundant IEC 61162-460 compliant network. This document does not introduce
    new application level protocol requirements to those that are defined in IEC 61162-450.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of July 2024 have been included in this
    copy."
