- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document deals with the tool capabilities and methods for model-based
    systems and software engineering (MBSSE). This document:</p><p class="ListContinue1"
    style="tab-stops: 19.85pt 39.7pt 59.55pt 79.4pt 99.25pt 119.05pt 138.9pt 158.75pt
    178.6pt 7.0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">— specifies
    a reference model for the overall structure and processes of MBSSE-specific processes,
    and describes how the components of the reference model fit together;</p><p class="ListContinue1"
    style="tab-stops: 19.85pt 39.7pt 59.55pt 79.4pt 99.25pt 119.05pt 138.9pt 158.75pt
    178.6pt 7.0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">— specifies
    interrelationships between the components of the reference model;</p><p class="ListContinue1"
    style="tab-stops: 19.85pt 39.7pt 59.55pt 79.4pt 99.25pt 119.05pt 138.9pt 158.75pt
    178.6pt 7.0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">— specifies
    MBSSE-specific processes for model-based systems and software engineering; the
    processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, outcomes and tasks;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="tab-stops: 19.85pt 39.7pt 59.55pt 79.4pt 99.25pt
    119.05pt 138.9pt 158.75pt 178.6pt 7.0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:

    class="ListContinue1" style="tab-stops: 19.85pt 39.7pt 59.55pt 79.4pt 99.25pt
    119.05pt 138.9pt 158.75pt 178.6pt 7.0cm; mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">— specifies tool capabilities to automate or semi-automate tasks or methods.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This
    document does not bring any additional life cycle processes for system and software
    but specifies an MBSSE reference model considered as activities, not only from
    the life cycle perspectives of systems engineering problem solving and the system-of-interest
    evolution, but also from the cognitive perspectives of modelling and model management,
    which can sustain and facilitate the system and software life cycle processes
    during digital transformation and in the digital age.</p><p class="MsoBodyText"
    style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">The processes defined
    in this document are applicable for a single project, as well as for an organization
    performing multiple projects or an enterprise. These processes are applicable
    for managing and performing the systems and software engineering activities based
    on models within any stage in the life cycle of a system-of-interest.</p>'
