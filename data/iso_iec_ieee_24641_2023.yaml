abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 24641:2023 This document deals with the tool capabilities
    and methods for model-based systems and software engineering (MBSSE). This document:<br
    />\r\n- specifies a reference model for the overall structure and processes of
    MBSSE-specific processes, and describes how the components of the reference model
    fit together;<br />\r\n- specifies interrelationships between the components of
    the reference model;<br />\r\n- specifies MBSSE-specific processes for model-based
    systems and software engineering; the processes are described in terms of purpose,
    inputs, outcomes and tasks;<br />\r\n- specifies methods to support the defined
    tasks of each process;<br />\r\n- specifies tool capabilities to automate or semi-automate
    tasks or methods.<br />\r\nThis document does not bring any additional life cycle
    processes for system and software but specifies an MBSSE reference model considered
    as activities, not only from the life cycle perspectives of systems engineering
    problem solving and the system-of-interest evolution, but also from the cognitive
    perspectives of modelling and model management, which can sustain and facilitate
    the system and software life cycle processes during digital transformation and
    in the digital age.<br />\r\nThe processes defined in this document are applicable
    for a single project, as well as for an organization performing multiple projects
    or an enterprise. These processes are applicable for managing and performing the
    systems and software engineering activities based on models within any stage in
    the life cycle of a system-of-interest."
