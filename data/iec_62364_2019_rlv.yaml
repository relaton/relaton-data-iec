abstract:
- content: "IEC 62364:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 62364:2019 gives guidelines
    for:<br />\r\na) presenting data on hydro-abrasive erosion rates on several combinations
    of water quality, operating conditions, component materials, and component properties
    collected from a variety of hydro sites;<br />\r\nb) developing guidelines for
    the methods of minimizing hydro-abrasive erosion by modifications to hydraulic
    design for clean water. These guidelines do not include details such as hydraulic
    profile shapes which are determined by the hydraulic design experts for a given
    site;<br />\r\nc) developing guidelines based on “experience data” concerning
    the relative resistance of materials faced with hydro-abrasive erosion problems;<br
    />\r\nd) developing guidelines concerning the maintainability of materials with
    high resistance to hydro-abrasive erosion and hardcoatings;<br />\r\ne) developing
    guidelines on a recommended approach, which owners could and should take to ensure
    that specifications communicate the need for particular attention to this aspect
    of hydraulic design at their sites without establishing criteria which cannot
    be satisfied because the means are beyond the control of the manufacturers;<br
    />\r\nf) developing guidelines concerning operation mode of the hydro turbines
    in water with particle materials to increase the operation life.<br />\r\nIt is
    assumed in this document that the water is not chemically aggressive. Since chemical
    aggressiveness is dependent upon so many possible chemical compositions, and the
    materials of the machine, it is beyond the scope of this document to address these
    issues. It is assumed in this document that cavitation is not present in the turbine.
    Cavitation and hydro-abrasive erosion can reinforce each other so that the resulting
    erosion is larger than the sum of cavitation erosion plus hydro-abrasive erosion.
    The quantitative relationship of the resulting hydro-abrasive erosion is not known
    and it is beyond the scope of this document to assess it, except to suggest that
    special efforts be made in the turbine design phase to minimize cavitation. Large
    solids (e.g. stones, wood, ice, metal objects, etc.) traveling with the water
    can impact turbine components and produce damage. This damage can in turn increase
    the flow turbulence thereby accelerating wear by both cavitation and hydro-abrasive
    erosion. Hydro-abrasive erosion resistant coatings can also be damaged locally
    by impact of large solids. It is beyond the scope of this document to address
    these issues. This document focuses mainly on hydroelectric powerplant equipment.
    Certain portions can also be applicable to other hydraulic machines. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2013. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the formula
    for TBO in Pelton reference model has been modified;<br />\r\nb) the formula for
    calculating sampling interval has been modified;<br />\r\nc) the chapter in hydro-abrasive
    erosion resistant coatings has been substantially modified;<br />\r\nd) the annex
    with test data for hydro-abrasive erosion resistant materials has been removed;<br
    />\r\ne) a simplified hydro-abrasive erosion evaluation has been added.<br /><br
    />\r\nKey words: Hydraulic Machines, Hydro-Abrasive Erosion, Kaplan, Francis,
    Pelton Turbines.</p>"
