abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30134-9:2022 This document specifies water usage effectiveness
    (WUE) as a key performance indicator (KPI) for quantifying the water consumption
    of a data centre during the use phase of the data centre life cycle.<br />\r\nWUE
    is a simple method for reporting the water intensity of the data centre operating.
    By reporting water consumption, it is possible to present the data centre's resource
    effectiveness.<br />\r\nThis document:<br />\r\na) defines the WUE of a data centre;<br
    />\r\nb) introduces WUE measurement categories;<br />\r\nc) describes the relationship
    of this KPI to a data centreâ€™s infrastructure, information technology equipment
    and information technology operations;<br />\r\nd) defines the measurement, the
    calculation and the reporting of the parameter; and<br />\r\ne) provides information
    on the correct interpretation of the WUE."
