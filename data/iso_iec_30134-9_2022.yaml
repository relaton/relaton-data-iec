abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies water usage effectiveness (WUE) as a key performance
    indicator (KPI) for quantifying the water consumption of a data centre during
    the use phase of the data centre life cycle.</p><p>WUE is a simple method for
    reporting the water intensity of the data centre operating. By reporting water
    consumption, it is possible to present the data centre's resource effectiveness.</p><p>This
    document:</p><p>a) defines the WUE of a data centre;</p><p>b) introduces WUE measurement
    categories;</p><p>c) describes the relationship of this KPI to a data centreâ€™s
    infrastructure, information technology equipment and information technology operations;</p><p>d)
    defines the measurement, the calculation and the reporting of the parameter; and</p><p>e)
    provides information on the correct interpretation of the WUE.</p>"
