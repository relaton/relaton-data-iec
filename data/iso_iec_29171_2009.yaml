abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29171:2009 specifies the dimensional, mechanical and physical characteristics
    of an information Versatile Disk for Removable usage (iVDR) cartridge to enable
    mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems. An iVDR cartridge
    can contain hard disk drive technology or other suitable storage technologies.
    ISO/IEC 29171:2009 specifies the environment in which iVDR cartridges are to be
    operated and stored, and specifies the dimensions and pin assignments of a connector
    employed by iVDR cartridges to enable data interchange. Together with ISO/IEC
    24739-3 and a standard for volume and file structure, ISO/IEC 29171:2009 enables
    full data interchange between data processing systems.
