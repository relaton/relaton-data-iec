abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63225:2019 highlights the problem of incompatibility of connectors
    for DC-application in photovoltaic systems (DC connectors) produced by different
    manufacturers. It addresses four particular issues in that context:\r\n \r\n\t
    background information on incompatibility of DC connectors from different manufacturers;
    \r\n\t observations and challenges concerning the handling of DC connectors from
    different manufacturers; \r\n\t stakeholders concerned by the incompatibility
    of DC connectors; \r\n\t recommendations for long-term standardization and interim
    measures to address incompatibility of DC connectors"
