abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63225:2019 highlights the problem of incompatibility of connectors
    for DC-application in photovoltaic systems (DC connectors) produced by different
    manufacturers. It addresses four particular issues in that context:<ul><li>background
    information on incompatibility of DC connectors from different manufacturers;</li><li>observations
    and challenges concerning the handling of DC connectors from different manufacturers;</li><li>stakeholders
    concerned by the incompatibility of DC connectors;</li><li>recommendations for
    long-term standardization and interim measures to address incompatibility of DC
    connectors</li></ul>
