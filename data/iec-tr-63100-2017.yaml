  content: IEC 63100:2017(E) describes 100-GHz spectrum measurement methods using
    RoF technologies. It covers the background to measurement over 100 GHz, the configuration
    of a spectrum analyser, the key technologies, such as mm-wave tunable filter,
    and RoF-technologies-based local oscillator, and provides some measured examples.
