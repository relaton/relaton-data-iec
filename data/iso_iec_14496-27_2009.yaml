abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-27:2009 specifies how tests can be designed to verify whether
    compressed data (i.e. bitstreams) and decoders meet the requirements for the synthetic
    3D graphics tools specified in ISO/IEC 14496‑11:2005, ISO/IEC 14496‑16:2006, ISO/IEC
    14496‑21:2006, and ISO/IEC 14496‑25:2009.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 14496-27:2009
    does not specifically address encoders. As far as synthetic 3D graphics are concerned,
    an encoder can be said to be an ISO/IEC 14496 encoder if it generates compressed
    data compliant with the syntactic and semantic bitstream payload requirements
    specified in ISO/IEC 14496‑11, ISO/IEC 14496‑16, ISO/IEC 14496‑21, and ISO/IEC
    14496‑25.<br /><br />\r\nCharacteristics of coded bitstreams and decoders are
    defined for ISO/IEC 14496‑11, ISO/IEC 14496‑16, ISO/IEC 14496‑21, and ISO/IEC
    14496‑25. The characteristics of a bitstream define the subset of the standard
    that is exploited in the bitstream. Examples are the applied values or range of
    the bitrate. Decoder characteristics define the properties and capabilities of
    the applied decoding process. An example of a property is the applied arithmetic
    accuracy. The capabilities of a decoder specify which coded bitstreams the decoder
    can decode and reconstruct, by defining the subset of the standard that may be
    exploited in decodable bitstreams. A bitstream can be decoded by a decoder if
    the characteristics of the coded bitstream are within the subset of the normative
    references.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 14496-27:2009 describes procedures for testing
    conformance of compressed data and decoders to the requirements defined in ISO/IEC
    14496‑11, ISO/IEC 14496‑16, ISO/IEC 14496‑21, and ISO/IEC 14496‑25; given the
    set of characteristics claimed, the requirements that shall be met are fully determined
    by these parts.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 14496-27:2009 summarizes the requirements,
    cross references them to characteristics, and defines how conformance with them
    can be tested. Guidelines are given on constructing tests to verify decoder conformance."
