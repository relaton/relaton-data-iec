abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-1CS:2022 This document specifies protocols, procedures,
    and managed objects for a Link-local Registration Protocol (LRP) to replicate
    a registration database from one end to the other of a point-to-point link and
    to replicate changes to parts of that database. A facility is provided to purge
    the replicated database if the source becomes unresponsive. Provision is made
    for a proxy system to operate LRP on behalf of a controlled system. LRP is optimized
    for databases on the order of 1 Mbyte.
