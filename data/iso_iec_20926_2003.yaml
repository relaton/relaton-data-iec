abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20926:2003 specifies the International Function Point Users Group
    (IFPUG) Release 4.1 unadjusted Functional Size Measurement Method.<br /><br />\r\nIt
    provides:a clear and detailed description of function point counting;<br />\r\na
    foundation to ensure that counts are consistent;<br />\r\nguidance to allow function
    point counting of Functional User Requirements from the deliverables of popular
    software development methodologies and techniques;<br />\r\na framework to enable
    automated support for function point counting.<br /><br />\r\nThe provisions of
    ISO/IEC 20926:2003 can be applied by anyone using function point analysis for
    software measurement. ISO/IEC 20926:2003 was designed for use by persons new to
    function point counting as well as those with intermediate and advanced experience."
