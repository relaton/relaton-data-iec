    point counting of Functional User Requirements from the deliverables of popular
    software development methodologies and techniques;</li><li>a framework to enable
    automated support for function point counting.</li></ul><p>The provisions of ISO/IEC
    20926:2003 can be applied by anyone using function point analysis for software
    measurement. ISO/IEC 20926:2003 was designed for use by persons new to function
    point counting as well as those with intermediate and advanced experience.</p>"
