  content: "IEC/TR 62271-305:2009(E) applies to high-voltage air-insulated disconnectors
    for rated voltages above 52 kV. The report describes the capacitive current switching
    duty and provides guidance on laboratory testing to demonstrate the switching
    capability. Air-insulated disconnectors equipped with auxiliary interrupting devices
    are included under this scope.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of June
    2017 have been included in this copy."
