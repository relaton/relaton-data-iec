abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 offers guidance on the management of software documentation
    to managers responsible for the production of software or software-based products.
    This guidance is intended to assist managers in ensuring that effective documentation
    is produced in their organizations.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 addresses
    the policies, standards, procedures, resources and plans with which managers must
    concern themselves in order to manage software documentation effectively.<br /><br
    />\r\nThe guidance given is intended to be applicable to all types of software,
    from the simplest program to the most complex software suite or software system.
    All types of software documentation are covered, relating to all stages of the
    software life cycle.<br /><br />\r\nThe principles of software documentation management
    are the same whatever the size of a project. For small projects, much of the detail
    given in ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 may not apply, but the principles remain the same.
    Managers may tailor the recommendations to their particular needs.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    guidance given is from the point of view of software documentation management.
    Detailed advice is not provided on, for example, the content and layout of software
    documents."
