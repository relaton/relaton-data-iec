abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20027:2018 This document provides guidelines to follow during
    the acquisition process of slap tenprints in order to obtain fingerprints of the
    best quality possible within acceptable time constraints.<br />\r\nNon-cooperative
    users are out of the scope of this document.<br />\r\nWhen using ten-fingerprint
    sensors, it is fundamental to know how to use them and how to proceed with the
    acquisition. This document describes how to capture fingerprints correctly by
    specifying best practices for slap tenprint captures.<br />\r\nIt gives recommendations
    on the following topics:<br />\r\n1) hardware of the fingerprint sensor and its
    deployment;<br />\r\n2) user guidance;<br />\r\n3) enrolment process including
    a sample workflow;<br />\r\n4) application software for developers and system
    integrators;<br />\r\n5) processing, compression and coding of the acquired fingerprint
    images;<br />\r\n6) operational issues and data logging;<br />\r\n7) evaluation
    of a solution and its components.<br />\r\nAlthough this document primarily focuses
    on reaching optimal data quality for enrolment purposes, the recommendations given
    here are applicable for other purposes. All processes which rely on good quality
    tenprint slaps can take advantage of the best practices."
