abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-2-10:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to mixers the rated voltage
    is not more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools, and 480 V for three-phase
    a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W. The limits for the applicability
    of this standard for battery tools are given in K.1 and L.1. This standard deals
    with the hazards presented by tools which are encountered by all persons in the
    normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the tools. Hand-held electric
    tools, which can be mounted on a support or working stand for use as fixed tools
    without any alteration of the tool itself, are within the scope of this standard
    and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support is considered to be a transportable
    tool and thus covered by the relevant Part 3. Mixers are not considered to be
    tools with a liquid system. This standard does not apply to drills and impact
    drills, even if they can be used as a mixer. This Part 2-10 is to be used in conjunction
    with the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014. The attention of National Committees
    is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may
    need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.<br />\r\nKey
