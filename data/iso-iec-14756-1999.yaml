    <p>This International Standard defines how user oriented performance of computer-based software systems (CBSS)</p>
    <p>may be measured and rated. A CBSS is a data processing system as it is seen by its users, e.g. by users at various</p>
    <p>terminals, or as it is seen by operational users and business users at the data processing center.</p>
    <p>A CBSS includes hardware and all its software (system software and application software) which is needed to</p>
    <p>realize the data processing functions required by the users or what may influence to the CBSS's time behaviour.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable for tests of all time constrained systems or system parts. Also a network</p>
    <p>may be part of a system or may be the main subject of a test. The method defined in this International Standard is</p>
    <p>not limited to special cases like classic batch or terminal-host systems, e.g. also included are client server systems</p>
    <p>or, with a broader comprehension of the definition of ?task', real time systems. But the practicability of tests may be</p>
    <p>limited by the expenditure required to test large environments.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies the key figures of user oriented performance terms and specifies a method of</p>
    <p>measuring and rating these performance values. The specified performance values are those which describe the</p>
    <p>execution speed of user orders (tasks), namely the triple of:</p>
    <p>-  execution time,</p>
    <p>-  throughput,</p>
    <p>-  timeliness.</p>
    <p>The user orders, subsequently called tasks, may be of simple or complex internal structure. A task may be a job,</p>
    <p>transaction, process or a more complex structure, but with a defined start and end depending on the needs of the</p>
    <p>evaluator. When evaluating the performance it is possible to use this International Standard for measuring the time</p>
    <p>behaviour with reference to business transaction completion times in addition to other individual response times.</p>
    <p>The rating is done with respect to users requirements or by comparing two or more measured systems (types or</p>
    <p>versions).</p>
    <p>Intentionally no proposals for measuring internal values, such as:</p>
    <p>-  utilisation values,</p>
    <p>-  mean instruction rates,</p>
    <p>-  path lengths,</p>
    <p>-  cache hit rates,</p>
    <p>-  queuing times,</p>
    <p>-  service times,</p>
    <p><b> </b></p>
    <p>are given, because the definition of internal values depends on the architecture of the hardware and the software of</p>
    <p>the system under test. Contrary to this the user oriented performance values which are defined in this International</p>
    <p>Standard are independent of architecture. The definition of internal performance values can be done independently</p>
    <p>from the definition of user oriented performance values. They may be used and can be measured in addition to the</p>
    <p>user oriented performance values. Also the definition of terms for the efficiency with which the user oriented values</p>
    <p>are produced can be done freely. In addition this International Standard gives guidance on how to establish at a</p>
    <p>data processing system a stable and reproducible state of operation. This reproducible state may be used to</p>
    <p>measure other performance values such as the above mentioned internal values.</p>
    <p>This International Standard focuses on:</p>
    <p>-  application software;</p>
    <p>-  system software;</p>
    <p>-  turn-key systems (i.e. systems consisting of an application software, the system software and the</p>
    <p>hardware for which it was designed);</p>
    <p>-  general data processing systems.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies the requirements for an emulation (by a technical system - the so-called</p>
    <p>remote terminal emulator (RTE) - of user interactions with a data processing system. It is the guideline for precisely</p>
    <p>measuring and rating the user oriented performance values. It provides the guideline for estimating these values</p>
    <p>with the required accuracy and repeatability of CBSSs with deterministic as well as random behaviour of users. It is</p>
    <p>also a guidance for implementing a RTE or proving whether it works according to this International Standard.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides the guideline to measure and rate the performance of CBSS with random user</p>
    <p>behaviour when the accuracy and repeatability is required. It specifies in detail how to prepare and carry out the</p>
    <p>measurement procedure. Along with a description of the analysis of the measured values, the formulas for</p>
    <p>computing the performance value and the rating value, are provided.</p>
    <p>This International Standard also gives guidance on:</p>
    <p>-  how to design a user oriented benchmark test using a:</p>
    <p>*  transaction oriented workload,</p>
    <p>*  batch oriented workload,</p>
    <p>*  or transaction and batch mixed workload.</p>
    <p>It specifies:</p>
    <p>-  how to describe such a workload,</p>
    <p>-  how to perform the measurement procedure,</p>
    <p>-  how to rate the measured results.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is of interest to:</p>
    <p>-  evaluators,</p>
    <p>-  developers,</p>
    <p>-  buyers (including users of a data processing system),</p>
    <p>-  system integrators</p>
    <p>of CBSSs.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1 The field of application of this International Standard may be extended to include the following aspects.</p>
    <p>Workloads fulfilling the specifications of this standard and having a sufficiently general structure may be used as standard</p>
    <p>workloads. They may be used to measure and rate performance of data processing systems used in specific fields. E.g. a</p>
    <p>standard workload for word-processing may be used to compare the time efficiency of different software products or</p>
    <p>different versions of the same product running on the same hardware system. Such a standard workload may also be</p>
    <p>used if always applying the same application software version and the same hardware to compare the efficiency of the</p>
    <p>system software. When applying the same application software and workload to different systems, consisting of hardware</p>
    <p>and system software, as normally sold by system vendors, the efficiency of the data processing systems may be</p>
    <p>compared with respect to the application and workload used.</p>
