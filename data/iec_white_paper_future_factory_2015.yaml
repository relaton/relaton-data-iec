abstract:
- content: "What will manufacturing look like in the future? How will humans and machines
    communicate with each other? Will our work environment adapt to our needs?<br
    /><br />\r\nIn the factory of the future humans will have to come to terms with
    an increasing complexity of processes, machines and components. This will require
    new operating concepts for optimized human-machine interaction.<br /><br />\r\nNimble,
    adaptive and intelligent manufacturing processes will be the measurement of success.
    The combination of “virtual” and “real” in order to get a full view of the complete
    value chain will allow factories to produce products more rapidly, more efﬁciently
    and with greater return using fewer resources.<br /><br />\r\nThis White Paper
    will assess the potential worldwide needs, beneﬁts, concepts and preconditions
    for the factory of the future. It identiﬁes the business trends in related technologies
    and markets, as well as their impact on data, people, technologies and standards.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis White Paper was developed by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB)
    in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and
    Automation IPA.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for free download."
