  content: IEC TR 63099-1:2017(E) provides information about the current and latest
    applications for antenna measurement that use radio-over-fibre technologies. Antenna
    gain and the antenna radiation pattern measurement system are covered, which are
    practically in use and will be used soon. Basic concepts, system configurations
    and measurement examples of the systems are included.
