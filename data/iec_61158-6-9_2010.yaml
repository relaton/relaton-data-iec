abstract:
- content: 'IEC 61158-6-9:2010(E) specifies the protocol of the Type 9 fieldbus application
    layer, in conformance with the OSI Basic Reference Model (ISO/IEC 7498-1) and
    the OSI application layer structure (ISO/IEC 9545). It defines the protocol provided
    to define the wire-representation of the service primitives defined in IEC 61158-5-5:2010,
    and the externally visible behavior associated with their transfer. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007 and constitutes
    a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are:
    corrections, in Table 32.'
