    applies to fixed capacitors for direct current, with metallized electrodes and polyethylene-terephthalate dielectric for use in electronic equipment.
    These capacitors may have "self-healing properties" depending on conditions of use. They are primarily intended for applications where the a.c. component is small with respect to the rated voltage. Two performance grades of capacitors are covered, Grade 1 for long-life application and Grade 2 for general application.
