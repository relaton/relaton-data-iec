abstract:
- content: "ISO 20294:2018 This document specifies the requirements for quantifying
    the carbon footprint of those processes, materials and technologies within the
    user's knowledge and control that are necessary for the delivery and use of e-media.
    It covers requirements to account for e-media archiving, distribution, use and
    storage. It is based on a life cycle assessment (LCA) approach, using defined
    system boundaries and a specified functional unit as the basis for complete or
    partial carbon footprinting studies. These data can be referenced throughout supply
    chains for individual e-media products.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to
    a carbon footprint of a product (CFP) study of e-media regarding contents and
    e-media devices.<br />\r\nThis document provides a framework for carbon calculators
    that organisations can follow and that can be used as the structure for market-
    or sector-specific carbon footprinting tools. Studies and tools constructed within
    this framework methodology provide carbon footprint quantifications of e-media
    that can be validated, verified and provide reference for future studies.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not assess any social or economic aspects or impacts, or any other
    environmental aspects and related impacts potentially arising from the life cycle
    of a product."
