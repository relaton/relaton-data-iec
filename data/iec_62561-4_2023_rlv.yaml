    edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with the latest edition of ISO IEC 60068-2-52:2017
    relating to salt mist atmosphere treatment;<br />\r\nb) alignment with the new
    edition of ISO 22479:2019 relating to humid sulphurous atmosphere treatment;<br
    />\r\nc) new normative annex for the applicability of previous tests."
