abstract:
- content: "1.1 Fields of application<br />\r\nThese Service Delivery guidelines are
    applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). A VSE is an enterprise, an organization,
    a department or a project having up to 25 people.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018
    provides guidance to manage a set of services delivered to customers. The VSE
    can act as an internal service provider (providing services internal to the VSE)
    or as an external service provider (providing services commercially to external
    customers). These lifecycle processes (Governance, Service Control, Service Relationship
    and Service Incident) support and enhance the activities of software and system
    operations (further to development and installation) to create effective and efficient
    products and services.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 provides guidance for
    Service Delivery. This document, when implemented, will assist and guide the VSE
    in the delivery of services which can benefit customers. This document does not
    promote uniformity in approach across all organizations as specific objectives
    and initiatives are tailored to suit an individual organization's needs.<br />\r\nTasks
    described in this guideline document (and therefore activities and processes)
    are related by input/output relationships which imply a logical execution sequence.
    The order of presentation of the processes or the associated numbering scheme
    is for identification purposes only, NOT to indicate implementation or execution
    order. As every VSE is different; tasks can be implemented in an order that is
    suitable for the organization, while respecting the relationships between tasks.<br
    />\r\n1.2 Target audience<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3:2018 is intended to be
    used by VSEs to establish processes to implement effective and efficient service
    delivery. This service delivery guidelines document can be used by VSEs that are
    offering only services to its customers or it can be combined with the information
    from ISO/IEC 29110 systems and/or software management and engineering guidelines."
