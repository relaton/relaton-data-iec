abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    ISO/IEC 19763 family of standards defines normative metamodels for the registration
    of models (including information models and process models), ontologies, services
    and roles & goals. Currently a lot of metadata registries or model registries
    were constructed and utilized in many different business domains, such as e-business,
    healthcare, automobile, electronics devices and civil construction.<br />\r\nOne
    of the key issues for the cross domain data or services integration must be enabling
    the easy discovery of metadata that are stored in the different registries that
    were scattered over different domains. Therefore, it is necessary to provide specific
    metadata that describes the registry itself in order to enable interoperation
    among different registries that were built following different standards.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19763:2015 family of standards specifies an information artefact called the Registry
    Summary. The Registry Summary consists of information that describes administrative
    aspects, the summary of contents and the technical access method of the registry.<br
    />\r\nA collection of multiple Registry Summary information is called a \"Registry
    of Registries\" or RoR, however, this standard does not mandate a particular implementation.
    Also, any specific protocol between Registry Summaries and RoR, such as creation
    of RoR and synchronization of RoR, would not be specified in this standard. Those
    are to be specified by other standards.<br />\r\nThe Registry Summary and RoR
    concept should be applied to all Metamodel Framework for Interoperability (MFI)
    registries, but its use may be applied to any kind of registries."
