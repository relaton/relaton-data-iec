abstract:
- content: "IEC 61400-25-4:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61400-25-4:2016
    specifies the specific mappings to protocol stacks encoding the messages required
    for the information exchange between a client and a remote server for: data access
    and retrieval, device control, event reporting and logging, publisher/subscriber,
    self-description of devices (device data dictionary), data typing and discovery
    of data types. The mappings specified in this part of IEC 61400-25 comprise:<br
    />\r\n- a mapping to SOAP-based web services,<br />\r\n- a mapping to OPC/XML-DA,<br
    />\r\n- a mapping to IEC 61850-8-1 MMS,<br />\r\n- a mapping to IEC 60870-5-104,<br
    />\r\n- a mapping to DNP3.<br />\r\nThe main technical changes with regard to
    the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- general harmonization with information
    models in IEC 61400-25-2 and information exchange services in IEC 61400-25-3;<br
    />\r\n- reduction of overlap between standards and simplification by increased
    referencing."
