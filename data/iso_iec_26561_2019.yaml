- content: "This document, within the context of methods and tools for supporting
    the diagnosis of the organization's capability to adopt or improve software and
    systems product line engineering:<br />\r\n- defines processes for product line
    technical probe; those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks
    and outcomes;<br />\r\n- defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks
    of each process; and<br />\r\n- defines tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate
    tasks and methods.<br />\r\nThis document does not concern processes and capabilities
    of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family
    of products."
