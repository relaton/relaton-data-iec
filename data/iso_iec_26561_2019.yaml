- content: "<p>This document, within the context of methods and tools for supporting
    the diagnosis of the organization's capability to adopt or improve software and
    systems product line engineering<strong>:</strong></p><p>— defines processes for
    product line technical probe; those processes are described in terms of purpose,
    inputs, tasks and outcomes;</p><p>— defines method capabilities to support the
    defined tasks of each process; and</p><p>— defines tool capabilities that automate
    or semi-automate tasks and methods.</p><p>This document does not concern processes
    and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with
    those for a family of products.</p>"
