abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62834:2013(E), which is a technical report, describes the "IEC nanoelectronics
    standardization roadmap". It intends to establish a common standardization strategy
    in the area of nano-electrotechnology. It covers the standardization plan from
    2009 to 2020 for nanomaterials, nanoscale devices, and nanofabrication processes.
    The report starts with a situation assessment of the market, the actual technology
    status, and future evolution. It provides later the list of potential standards
    to be developed within the concerned timeframe. The goal of this technical report
    is to build a consensus among members of the nano-electrotechnology community
    on a framework leading to inputs for consideration in standards development.
