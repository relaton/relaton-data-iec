  content: This Publicly Available Specification (PAS) defines a methodology for power
    system domain experts to determine and describe their user requirements for automation
    systems, based on their utility business needs. This methodology was originally
    developed as part of the IntelliGrid Architecture developed by the Electrical
    Power Research Institute (EPRI), as a means to implement the "IntelliGrid vision"
    of the automated, self-healing, and efficient power system of the future.
