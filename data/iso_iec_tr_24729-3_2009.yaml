abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24729-3:2009 provides reference information and practical
    knowledge in the selection, installation and application of ISO/IEC 18000-6C RFID
    Readers. RFID Readers include fixed mounted (such as portal, conveyor, and wrap
    stations), handheld (tethered and wireless), and mobile mounted (such as those
    found on forklifts). ISO/IEC TR 24729-3:2009 presents guidelines to improve the
    performance of RFID data collection systems for more successful applications and
    to cover the approaches necessary to ensure that the operational requirements
    of the end user are met. Many of the techniques recommended are the result of
    practical tests in working environments. However, each application is different
    and thus the techniques recommended herein might not be applicable in all situations.</p>"
