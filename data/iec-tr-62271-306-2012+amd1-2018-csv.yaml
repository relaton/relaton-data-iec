  content: IEC TR 62271-306:2012+A1:2018 is applicable to a.c. circuit-breakers designed
    for indoor or outdoor installation and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and
    60 Hz on systems having voltages above 1 000 V. This technical report addresses
    utility, consultant and industrial engineers who specify and apply high-voltage
    circuit-breakers, circuit-breaker development engineers, engineers in testing
    stations, and engineers who participate in standardization. It is intended to
    provide background information concerning the facts and figures in the standards
    and provide a basis for specification for high-voltage circuit-breakers. Thus,
    its scope will cover the explanation, interpretation and application of IEC 62271-100
    and IEC 62271-1 as well as related standards and technical reports with respect
    to high-voltage circuit-breakers. This consolidated version consists of the first
    edition (2012) and its amendment 1 (2018). Therefore, no need to order amendment
    in addition to this publication.
