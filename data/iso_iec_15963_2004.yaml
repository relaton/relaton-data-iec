abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15963:2004 describes numbering systems that are available for
    the identification of RF tags.</p><p>A unique ID is required as part of the write
    operation to RFID tags. The unique ID guarantees that the information written
    to a tag is unambiguously written to the correct data carrier (tag). A unique
    ID is also required in many read situations where the contents of the tag are
    tied to a specific item and that item needs to be unambiguously identified.</p><p>The
    unique ID may also be used</p><ul><li>for the traceability of the integrated circuit
    itself for quality control in their manufacturing process;</li><li>for the traceability
    of the RF tag during its manufacturing process and along its lifetime;</li><li>for
    the completion of the reading in a multi-antenna configuration;</li><li>by the
    anti-collision mechanism, to inventory multiple tags in the reader's field of
    view;</li><li>for the traceability of the item to which the RF tag is attached.</li></ul>"
