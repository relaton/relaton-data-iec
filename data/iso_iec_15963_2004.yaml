abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15963:2004 describes numbering systems that are available for the
    identification of RF tags. A unique ID is required as part of the write operation
    to RFID tags. The unique ID guarantees that the information written to a tag is
    unambiguously written to the correct data carrier (tag). A unique ID is also required
    in many read situations where the contents of the tag are tied to a specific item
    and that item needs to be unambiguously identified.The unique ID may also be usedfor
    the traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in their
    manufacturing process;for the traceability of the RF tag during its manufacturing
    process and along its lifetime;for the completion of the reading in a multi-antenna
    configuration; by the anti-collision mechanism, to inventory multiple tags in
    the reader's field of view;for the traceability of the item to which the RF tag
    is attached.
