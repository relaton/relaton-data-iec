  content: "IEC 61196-6-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61196-6-2:2020 applies
    to coaxial communication cables described in IEC 61196-6. It specifies the requirements
    for 75-4 type CATV drop cables. These cables are used in CATV distribution systems,
    surveillance & control systems, satellite television receiving systems and as
    bidirectional hybrid fibre coaxes (HFC). The operating frequency is from 5 MHz
    to 3 000 MHz. This document is to be used in conjunction with IEC 61196-1 and
    IEC 61196‑6. It determines the layout and style with respect to the model and
    type. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in
    2018. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- designation of variants including construction
    details<br />\r\n- consistent screening classes,<br />\r\n- bending test only
    for flexible cables.</p>"
