abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26558:2017, within the context of methods and tools for supporting
    explicit and/or separate variability modelling, variability model management and
    variability model support in software and systems product lines:<br />\r\n- provides
    the terms and definitions specific to variability modelling for software and systems
    product line;<br />\r\n- defines processes for variability modelling, variability
    model management and variability model support throughout the product line lifecycle.
    Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;<br
    />\r\n- defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;<br
    />\r\n- defines tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 26558:2017 does not concern processes and capabilities of tools
    and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products."
