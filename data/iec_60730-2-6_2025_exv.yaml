abstract:
- content: "IEC 60730-2-6:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60730-2-6:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60730-1:2022.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60730-2-6:2025 applies to automatic electrical
    pressure sensing controls<br />\r\n• for use in, on, or in association with equipment
    for household appliance and similar use;<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Throughout this document,
    the word \"equipment\" means \"appliance and equipment\" and \"controls\" means
    \"pressure sensing controls\".<br />\r\n• for building automation within the scope
    of ISO 16484 series and IEC 63044 series (HBES/BACS);<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 1 Independently
    mounted automatic electrical pressure sensing controls, controls in smart grid
    systems and controls for building automation systems within the scope of ISO 16484-2.<br
    />\r\n• for equipment that is used by the public, such as equipment intended to
    be used in shops, offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial applications;<br
    />\r\nEXAMPLE 2 Automatic electrical pressure sensing controls for commercial
    catering, heating and air-conditioning equipment.<br />\r\n• that are smart enabled
    automatic electrical pressure sensing controls;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 3 Smart grid
    automatic electrical pressure sensing controls, remote interfaces/control of energy-consuming
    equipment including computer or smart phone.<br />\r\n• that are AC or DC powered
    controls with a rated voltage not exceeding 690 V AC or 600 V DC;<br />\r\n• used
    in, on, or in association with equipment that use electricity, gas, oil, solid
    fuel, solar thermal energy, etc., or a combination thereof;<br />\r\n• utilized
    as part of a control system or controls which are mechanically integral with multifunctional
    controls having non-electrical outputs;<br />\r\n• using NTC or PTC thermistors
    and to discrete thermistors, requirements for which are contained in Annex J;<br
    />\r\n• that are mechanically or electrically operated, responsive to or controlling
    a pressure or vacuum;<br />\r\n• as well as manual controls when such are electrically
    and/or mechanically integral with automatic controls.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Requirements
    for manually actuated mechanical switches not forming part of an automatic control
    are contained in IEC 61058-1-1.<br />\r\nThis document is also applicable to individual
    pressure sensing controls utilized as part of a control system or pressure sensing
    controls which are mechanically integral with multi-functional controls having
    non-electrical outputs.<br />\r\nThis document is also applicable to pressure
    sensing controls for appliances within the scope of IEC 60335-1.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to<br />\r\n- the inherent safety of pressure sensing controls,
    and<br />\r\n- functional safety of pressure sensing controls and safety related
    systems,<br />\r\n- pressure sensing controls where the performance (for example
    the effect of EMC phenomena) of the product can impair the overall safety and
    performance of the controlled system,<br />\r\n- the operating values, operating
    times, and operating sequences where such are associated with equipment safety.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies the requirements for construction, operation and
    testing of automatic electrical controls used in, on, or in association with an
    equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not<br />\r\n• apply to pressure sensing
    controls intended exclusively for industrial process applications unless explicitly
    mentioned in the relevant part 2 or the equipment standard. However, this document
    can be applied to evaluate automatic electrical controls intended specifically
    for industrial applications in cases where no relevant safety standard exists;<br
    />\r\n• take into account the response value of an automatic action of a pressure
    sensing control, if such a response value is dependent upon the method of mounting
    the control in the equipment. Where a response value is of significant purpose
    for the protection of the user, or surroundings, the value defined in the appropriate
    equipment standard or as determined by the manufacturer will apply;<br />\r\n•
    address the integrity of the output signal to the network devices, such as interoperability
    with other devices unless it has been evaluated as part of the control system.<br
    />\r\nThis document contains requirements for electrical features of pressure
    sensing controls and requirements for mechanical features that affect their intended
    operation.<br />\r\nNOTE Subclause 20.101, as it pertains to gas and/or oil controls,
    is under consideration pending review or revision of ISO 22967, ISO 22968 and
    ISO 23550, if applicable.<br />\r\nIn general, these pressure sensing controls
    are integrated or incorporated with the equipment or are intended to be integrated
    in, or on the equipment. This document also covers these controls when they are
    independently mounted. In-line cord controls are not covered by this document.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2015 and its Amendment 1:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\nAdoption of IEC 60730-1:2022 with all of its
    significant changes to IEC 60730-1:2013, IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD 1:2015 and IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD2:2020."
