abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62565-4-2:2018 specifies the essential general and optical requirements
    of monodisperse luminescent nanomaterials used in general lighting and display
    products to enable their reliable mass production and quality control during the
    manufacturing process. This document does not address mixtures or agglomerations
    of luminescent nanomaterials.<br />\r\nIn addition, this document enables the
    customer to specify requirements in a standardized manner and to verify through
    standardized methods that the luminescent nanomaterial meets the required properties."
