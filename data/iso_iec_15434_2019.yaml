abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a transfer structure, syntax, and coding of messages
    and data formats when using high-capacity ADC media between trading partners (specifically
    between suppliers and recipients) and, where applicable, in support of carrier
    applications, such as bills of lading, and carrier sortation and tracking.<br
    />\r\nThe data encoded according to this document include:<br />\r\n— data which
    can be used in the shipping, receiving and inventory of transport units;<br />\r\n—
    data which can be contained within supporting documentation, in paper or electronic
    form, related to unit loads or transport packages;<br />\r\n— data which can be
    used in the sortation and tracking of transport units.<br />\r\nThis document
    describes the ISO/IEC 646 characters used for automatic data capture; it is not
    the controlling specification for data structures (e.g. CII) referenced in this
    International Standard.<br />\r\nThis document does not supersede or replace any
    applicable safety or other marking or labelling requirements. It is intended to
    be applied in addition to any other mandated labelling requirements."
