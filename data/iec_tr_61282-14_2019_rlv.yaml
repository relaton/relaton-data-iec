abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61282-14:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 61282-14:2019
    which is a Technical Report, establishes the detailed analysis and calculation
    of the uncertainties related to the measurement of the attenuation of both multimode
    and single mode optical fibre cabling using optical light sources and power meters.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    in the title: replacement of \"guide\" by \"guidelines\";<br />\r\n- text adaptation
    to allow both standard grade B and reference grade connectors for termination
    of test cords;<br />\r\n- addition of values needed for calculation of uncertainties,
    when standard grade connectors are used, to Annex D;<br />\r\n- correction of
    minor inconsistencies in Equation (18) and after.<br />\r\nKeywords: measurement
    uncertainty of the attenuation of fibre optic cabling"
