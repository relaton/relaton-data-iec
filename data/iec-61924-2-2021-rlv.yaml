  content: "IEC 61924-2:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61924-2:2021
    specifies the minimum requirements for the design, manufacture, integration, methods
    of testing and required test results for an integrated navigation system (INS)
    to comply with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) requirements of Resolution
    MSC.252(83), as amended by Resolution MSC.452(99). In addition, it takes account
    of IMO Resolution A.694(17) to which IEC 60945 is associated. When a requirement
    in this document is different from IEC 60945, the requirement of this document
    takes precedence."
