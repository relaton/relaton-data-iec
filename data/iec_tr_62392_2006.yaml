abstract:
- content: Gives information for the assessment of factors associated with the polymer
    recycling and/or reuse of typical insulating materials in electrotechnical equipment.
    It gives information and assistance to developers and design engineers for assessment
    in selecting polymers and polymer combinations, and is a contribution to the preservation
    of resources and the minimization of disposal costs at the end of a product life.
    The environmental compatibility of polymers must be assessed in the light of the
    function of the materials in the product and the total service life. An important
    aspect is the recovery of the material at the end of the product life. The value
    level of material recycling as recovery option can be improved by incorporation
    of suitability for dismantling into the design of the article and the choice of
    insulating materials which are generally used. This document will cover material
    recycling only as part of recovery.
