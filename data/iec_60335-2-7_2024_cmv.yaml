abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-7:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-7:2024 edition 9.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-7:2019
    edition 8.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-7:2024 deals with the safety of electric washing machines
    for household and similar use, that are intended for washing clothes and textiles,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and
    480 V for other appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and
    battery-operated appliances. This standard also deals with the safety of electric
    washing machines for household and similar use employing an electrolyte instead
    of detergent. Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this
    standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common
    hazards presented by washing machines that are encountered by all persons in and
    around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n-
    persons (including children) whose: physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for washing machines intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- washing machines intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes (ISO 10472-2);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used
    in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- washing machines incorporating
    steam generating devices in which steam is produced at a pressure exceeding 50
    kPa;<br />\r\n- washing machines for commercial use including those for communal
    use in blocks of flats or in launderettes (IEC 60335-2-122).<br />\r\nThis ninth
    edition cancels and replaces the eighth edition published in 2019. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 20.104, 20.105);<br />\r\nc) addition of requirements for restarting
    the spin cycle of agitator washing machines and impeller washing machines (20.108);<br
    />\r\nd) addition of requirements for remote operation (22.51);<br />\r\ne) application
    of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to
    be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
