abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 13249-1:2016 defines a number of packages of generic data types
    and table structures common to various kinds of data used in multimedia and application
    areas, to enable that data to be stored and manipulated in an SQL database. The
    package in each subject area is defined as a part of ISO/IEC 13249.<p>ISO/IEC
    13249-1:2016 defines those concepts, notations and conventions that are common
    to two or more other parts of ISO/IEC 13249. In particular, it describes the way
    parts of ISO/IEC 9075 are used to define the user-defined types and their behaviour
    and views as a representation of table structures appropriate to each subject
    area.</p>
