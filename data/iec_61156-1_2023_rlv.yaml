abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61156-1:2023
    specifies the definitions, requirements and test methods of multicore, symmetrical
    pair and quad cables. This document is applicable to communication systems such
    as local area networks (LANs) and data communication cables. It is also applicable
    to cables used for industrial applications, customer premises wiring and generic
    cabling comprising installation cables and cables for work area wiring which are
    defined in ISO/IEC 11801 (all parts). The cables covered by this document are
    intended to operate with voltages and currents normally encountered in communication
    systems. While these cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low
    impedance sources, for example the electric power supplies of public utility mains,
    they are intended to be used to support the delivery of low voltage remote powering
    applications including but not restricted to Power over Ethernet as specified
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3."
