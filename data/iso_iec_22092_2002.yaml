abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical
    characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-magnetic
    and magneto-optical effects to enable data interchange between such disks.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    22092:2002 specifies two Types, viz.</p><p>Type R/W provides for data to be written,
    read and erased many time over the recording surface(s) of the disk.</p><p>Type
    WO provides for data once written to be read a multiplicity of times. Data shall
    not be erased nor amended. Multisession (incremental write operations) recording
    may be performed on type WO disks.</p><p>The disk shall be of the same Type if
    recorded on both sides, A and B. Each side shall have a nominal capacity of 4,58
    Gbytes, irrespective of the Type. The format specifies two sector sizes and allows
    for emulation of two further sizes.</p><p>ISO/IEC 22092:2002 specifies</p><ul><li>the
    conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</li><li>the environments
    in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</li><li>the mechanical,
    physical and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge so as to provide mechanical
    interchangeability between data processing systems;</li><li>the format of the
    information on the disk, both embossed and user-written, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correction codes, the modulation
    methods used;</li><li>the characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;</li><li>the
    thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical characteristics of the disk, enabling processing
    systems to write data onto the disk;</li><li>the minimum quality of user-written
    data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    22092:2002 provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with
    a standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems.</p>"
