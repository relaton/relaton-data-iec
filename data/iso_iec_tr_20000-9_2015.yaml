abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 20000-9:2015 provides guidance on the use of ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011
    for service providers delivering cloud services. It is applicable to different
    categories of cloud service, such as those defined in ISO/IEC 17788/ITU-T Y.3500
    and ISO/IEC 17789/ITU-T Y.3502, including, but not limited to, the following:
    a) infrastructure as a service (IaaS); b) platform as a service (PaaS); c) software
    as a service (SaaS). It is also applicable to public, private, community, and
    hybrid cloud deployment models. The applicability of ISO/IEC 20000-1 is independent
    of the type of technology or service model used to deliver the services. All requirements
    in ISO/IEC 20000-1 can be applicable to cloud service providers. The structure
    of ISO/IEC TR 20000-9:2015 does not follow the structure of ISO/IEC 20000-1. The
    guidance is presented as a set of scenarios that can address many of the typical
    activities of a cloud service provider. The guidance in ISO/IEC TR 20000-9:2015
    can also be useful for customers of cloud service providers. This part of ISO/IEC
    TR 20000-9:2015 can be used as guidance for a cloud service provider in designing,
    managing, or improving an SMS to support cloud services. ISO/IEC TR 20000-9:2015
    does not add any requirements to those stated in ISO/IEC 20000-1 and does not
    state explicitly how evidence can be provided to an assessor or auditor. The scope
    of ISO/IEC TR 20000-9:2015 excludes any specifications for products or tools.'
