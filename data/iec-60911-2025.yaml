  content: "IEC 60911:2025 applies to pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and presents
    requirements for the monitoring of adequate cooling within the core in all operations,
    including normal and abnormal operations. Requirements for core cooling monitoring
    during conditions beyond a design basis accident, i.e. a design extension condition
    of type A or type B, are also covered in this document.<br />\r\nThis document
    defines requirements for instrumentation to measure coolant parameters, which
    are of interest when abnormal conditions arise with either one or two phases of
    coolant or with gas included in the reactor pressure vessel (RPV).<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1987. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Modification of the title.<br />\r\nb) Integration
    and merging with the content of IEC 62117:1999 relative to the monitoring of core
    cooling during cold shutdown.<br />\r\nc) Integration of feedback following the
    2011 Fukushima accident."
