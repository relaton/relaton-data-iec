abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18014-3:2009describes a general model for time-stamping services
    producing linked tokens,describes the basic components used to construct a time-stamping
    service producing linked tokens,defines the data structures used to interact with
    a time-stamping service producing linked tokens,describes specific instances of
    time-stamping services producing linked tokens, anddefines a protocol to be utilized
    by time-stamping services producing linked tokens for the purpose of extending
    linked tokens to published values.
