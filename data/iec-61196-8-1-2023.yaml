  content: "IEC 61196-8-1:2023 applies to coaxial communication cables described in
    IEC 61196-8. It specifies the requirements of semi-flexible coaxial communication
    cables with fluoropolymer dielectric and tin soaked copper wire braid outer conductor.
    These cables are intended for use in mobile communication base station antenna
    systems, terrestrial microwave communication, radar systems and wireless equipment
    or other signal transmission equipment or units.<br />\r\nThis document determines
    the layout and style for detail specifications. Detail specifications (DS) can
    be prepared by a national organization, a manufacturer or a user by entering the
    details in the blank detail specification."
