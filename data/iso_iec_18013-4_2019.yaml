abstract:
- content: "This document describes the test methods used for conformity testing,
    that is methods for determining whether a driving licence can be considered to
    comply with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 18013 series for:<br />\r\n- machine
    readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013-2), and<br />\r\n- access control, authentication
    and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3).<br />\r\nThe test methods described
    in this document are based on specifications defined in ISO/IEC 18013-2 and ISO/IEC
    18013-3 and underlying normative specifications.<br />\r\nThis document deals
    with test methods specific to IDL requirements. Test methods applicable to (smart)
    cards in general (e.g. those specified in the ISO/IEC 10373 series) are outside
    the scope of this document.<br />\r\nHence the purpose of this document is to:<br
    />\r\n- provide IDL implementers with requirements for conformity evaluation,<br
    />\r\n- provide IDL issuing authorities with requirements for quality assurance,
    and<br />\r\n- provide test laboratories and test tool providers with test suite
    requirements."
