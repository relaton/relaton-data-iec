- content: |-
    IEC/TS 62257-9-5:2013(E) applies to stand-alone rechargeable electric lighting appliances or kits that can be installed by a typical user without employing a technician. This technical specification presents a quality assurance framework that includes product specifications (a framework for interpreting test results), test methods, and standardized specifications sheets (templates for communicating test results). The intended users of this technical specification are:<br />
    - market support programmes;<br />
    - manufacturers and distributors;<br />
    - bulk procurement programmes;<br />
    - trade regulators. The main changes with respect to the first edition are:<br />
    - overall, shifted from narrow focus on the needs of bulk procurement programmes to a wider framework for structuring quality assurance using appropriate methods for a range of stakeholders including governments, manufacturers, buyers, and others;<br />
    - revised structure of document with modular methods (located in annexes) that are applied using four distinct test regimes;<br />
    - added a framework for categorizing products based on the arrangement of components.<br /><br />This publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC/TS 62257-1:2003, IEC 62257-2:2004, IEC 62257-3:2004, IEC 62257-4:2005, IEC 62257-5:2005 and IEC 62257-6:2005
