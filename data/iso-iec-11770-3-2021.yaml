    <p>This document defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric cryptographic techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques to achieve the following goals.</p>
    <p>a) Establish a shared secret key for use in a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> by key agreement. In a secret key agreement mechanism, the secret key is computed as the result of a data exchange between the two entities <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>. Neither of them is able to predetermine the value of the shared secret key.</p>
    <p>b) Establish a shared secret key for use in a symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> via key transport. In a secret key transport mechanism, the secret key is chosen by one entity <em>A</em> and is transferred to another entity <em>B</em>, suitably protected by asymmetric techniques.</p>
    <p>c) Make an entity's public key available to other entities via key transport. In a public key transport mechanism, the public key of entity <em>A</em> is transferred to other entities in an authenticated way, but not requiring secrecy.</p>
    <p>Some of the mechanisms of this document are based on the corresponding authentication mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798‑3.</p>
    <p>This document does not cover certain aspects of key management, such as:</p>
    <p>—    key lifecycle management;</p>
    <p>—    mechanisms to generate or validate asymmetric key pairs; and</p>
    <p>—    mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy, etc., keys.</p>
    <p>While this document does not explicitly cover the distribution of an entity's private key (of an asymmetric key pair) from a trusted third party to a requesting entity, the key transport mechanisms described can be used to achieve this. A private key can in all cases be distributed with these mechanisms where an existing, non-compromised key already exists. However, in practice the distribution of private keys is usually a manual process that relies on technological means such as smart cards, etc.</p>
    <p>This document does not specify the transformations used in the key management mechanisms.</p>
    <p>NOTE       To provide origin authentication for key management messages, it is possible to make provisions for authenticity within the key establishment protocol or to use a public key signature system to sign the key exchange messages.</p>
