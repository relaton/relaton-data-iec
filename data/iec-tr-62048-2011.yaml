  content: "IEC/TR 62048:2011(E) gives formulae to estimate the reliability of a fibre
    under a constant service stress. It is based on a power law for crack growth which
    is derived empirically. Reliability is expressed as an expected lifetime or as
    an expected failure rate. The main changes with respect to the previous edition
    are:<br />\r\n- correction to the FIT equation in addition to all call-outs and
    derivations;<br />\r\n- insertion of a new section explaining how to numerically
    calculate bends and tension;<br />\r\n- editorial corrections of inconsistencies."
