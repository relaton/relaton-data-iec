abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63384-2:2026 addresses the quantitative assessment of power system
    stability and security. Its purpose is to provide guidelines encompassing the
    use of terms and definitions, as well as the objectives and general requirements
    for conducting quantitative assessments. The TS includes the classification of
    stability and security, classification of quantitative indices, and key considerations
    for implementing quantitative assessments.<br />\r\nThe TS is applicable to various
    domains, including system planning, operation planning, operation control, stability
    control system design, and stability control decision planning, as well as software,
    equipment, and systems for the secure and stable operation of the power system.<br
    />\r\nThe stability and security quantitative assessment techniques specified
    in IEC TS 63384-2 are independent of any specific software, equipment, or systems
    used for the secure and stable operation of the power system."
