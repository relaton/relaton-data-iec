abstract:
- content: 'The SCSI parallel interface is a local I&#x2F;O bus that may be operated
    over a wide range of transfer rates.The objectives of the SCSI parallel interface
    are: a) To provide host computers with device independence within a class of devices.
    Thus,different disk drives, tape drives, printers, optical media drives and other
    devices may be added to the host computers without requiring modifications to
    generic system hardware. b) To provide compatibility such that properly conforming
    SCSI-2 devices may interoperate with SCSI-3 devices given that the systems engineering
    is correctly done. This international standard defines the mechanical, electrical,
    timing and protocol requirements of the SCSI parallel interface to allow conforming
    devices to interoperate. The interface protocol includes provision for the connection
    of multiple initiators and multiple targets. This standard defines the physical
    attributes of an input&#x2F;output bus for interconnecting computers and peripheral
    devices.'
