  content: "ISO/IEC 15067-3:2024 focuses on a model of a system in homes and buildings
    that can manage energy consumption and generation of electricity by devices on
    premises dynamically in response to electricity availability from:<br />\r\n–
    sources within the home or building such as solar panels, wind turbines, or storage
    (stationary or mobile),<br />\r\n– neighbourhood microgrids,<br />\r\n– transactive
    energy,<br />\r\n– energy aggregators, and<br />\r\n– public utilities.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies a model including a framework and methods for energy management
    consisting of interconnected elements that can be configured to support various
    methods for a Home Electronic System (HES) energy management system. The methods
    specified are intended to be generic and representative of a wide range of situations.
    This document applies to the customer grid-edge portion of the electricity grid
    (within a home or building) and applies even if the consumer has sufficient local
    power generation to operate without connecting to a public utility.<br />\r\nThis
    document includes an energy management model that balances power supplied from
    internal and external sources with demand from appliances and electric vehicle
    chargers. The model offers flexibility for locating the energy management equipment
    in a stand-alone product, embedded in consumer electronics, or hosted in a gateway.
    This gateway can be a generic communications interface between a home network
    and an external network, an energy management gateway designed for handling energy-related
    data, or the HES gateway specified in the ISO/IEC 15045 series.<br />\r\nThis
    model specifies a local controller that achieves the allocation of power in accordance
    with available supplies, consumer preferences for appliance operation, and power
    requirements of these appliances within constraints set by the consumer. Such
    constraints are typically financial (a budget for electricity) but can also include
    goals such as using green sources and minimizing their impact on climate change.
    This controller is called the energy management agent (EMA) since it acts as an
    agent for the consumer. This model accommodates an EMA with technology of artificial
    intelligence to facilitate energy management.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) This edition revises ISO/IEC
    15067-3:2012 by expanding beyond demand response to include a balance between
    multiple sources of power and appliance demands for this power.<br />\r\nb) This
    edition specifies a system framework that addresses the need for user-centric
    energy management by providing control options for consumers."
