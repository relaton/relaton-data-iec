  content: 'IEC 60317-15:2019+AMD1:2010+AMD2:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of
    enamelled round aluminium winding wire of class 180 with a sole coating based
    on polyesterimide resin, which may be modified providing it retains the chemical
    identity of the original resin and meets all specified wire requirements. Class
    180 is a thermal class that requires a minimum temperature index of 180 and a
    heat shock temperature of at least 200 °C. The temperature in degrees Celsius
    corresponding to the temperature index is not necessarily that at which it is
    recommended that the wire be operated and this will depend on many factors, including
    the type of equipment involved. The range of nominal conductor diameters covered
    by this standard is as follows: - grade 1: 0,400 mm up to and including 1,600
    mm; - grade 2: 0,400 mm up to and including 5,000 mm. The nominal conductor diameters
    are specified in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-3. The main changes with respect to the
    previous edition are listed below: - new requirements for appearance, Subclause
    3.2, added; - springiness test, Clause 7, determined to be inappropriate; - cut-through
    test, Clause 10, determined to be inappropriate; - high temperature failure test,
    Clause 22, deleted; - new pin hole test, Clause 23, added.'
