abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-18:2009 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60079-18:2009
    gives the specific requirements for the construction, testing and marking of electrical
    equipment, parts of electrical equipment and Ex components with the type of protection
    encapsulation \"m\" intended for use in explosive gas atmospheres or explosive
    dust atmospheres. This part applies only for encapsulated electrical equipment,
    encapsulated parts of electrical equipment and encapsulated Ex components where
    the rated voltage does not exceed 11 kV. The significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- Incorporation of level
    of protection \"mc\"<br />\r\n- Equipment protection levels (EPL Ma, Ga, Da, Mb,
    Gb, Db, Gc, Dc)<br />\r\n- Incorporation of the dust requirements<br />\r\n- Incorporation
    of switching contacts for level of protection \"ma\".<br /><br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60079-0:2007.<br /><br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of June 2009 have been included in this copy."
