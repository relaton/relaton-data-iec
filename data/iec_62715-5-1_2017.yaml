abstract:
- content: IEC 62715-5-1:2017(E) specifies the standard measuring conditions and measuring
    methods for determining the optical performance of flexible displays in the dark
    or under ambient illumination. This document mainly applies to display modules
    that are bendable about one axis. The display is measured in a static mechanical
    state. The measuring methods apply to monochrome or colour displays with a single
    radius of curvature of 35 mm or greater.
