  content: "IEC TS 62257-9-4:2016(E) specifies the general requirements for the design
    and the implementation of a user's installation. It applies to single phase user's
    electrical installations with maximum power of 500 VA, in decentralized rural
    electrification systems. It is applicable to installations supplied by an AC microgrid
    and to installations encompassing their own single-unit AC micropower plant or
    DC micropower plant. The main technical changes with regard to the previous edition
    are as follows: changing the voltage range covered by the technical specification
    to AC nominal voltage below 1 000 V and DC nominal voltage below 1 500 V.<br />\r\n<br
