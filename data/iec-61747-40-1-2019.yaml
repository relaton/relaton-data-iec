  content: "IEC 61747-40-1:2019 provides mechanical performance testing guidelines
    for cover glass used in electronic flat panel displays in mobile devices. This
    document focuses on key mechanical testing performance parameters and covers mainly
    strength and damage resistance attributes. The test methods focus on the cover
    glass level testing only. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- withdrawal of test methods
    unsuitable for mobile display cover,<br />\r\n- revision of test methods based
    on newly developed market relevance,<br />\r\n- addition of test method for abraded
    strength,<br />\r\n- addition of explanations about the relevance between the
    test methods and the fracture mode, and<br />\r\n- revision of terms and definitions."
