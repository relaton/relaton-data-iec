abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-50:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-50:2021
    deals with the safety of electrically operated commercial bains-marie, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances connected between
    one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other appliances.<br />\r\nThese appliances
    are not intended for household and similar purposes. They are used for commercial
    processing of food, also in areas open to the public, for example in kitchens
    of restaurants, canteens, hospitals and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries
    and butcheries.<br />\r\nThe electrical part of appliances making use of other
    forms of energy is also within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as
    is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by these
    types of appliances.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar
    authorities;<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used outdoors, additional
    requirements can be necessary.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n-
    appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n-
    appliances for continuous mass production of food;<br />\r\n- battery-operated
    appliances;<br />\r\n- appliances for heating liquids for household use covered
    by IEC 60335-2-15 and used in the following environments by laymen:<br />\r\n•
    staff kitchen areas in shops, offices and other working environments;<br />\r\n•
    farm houses;<br />\r\n• by clients in hotels, motels and other residential type
    environments;<br />\r\n• bed and breakfast type environments.<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:
    2007 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text, modified or deleted
    (Clause 1, 7.15, 10.1, 11.7, 16.2, 20.1, 20.101, 21.101, 22.101, 23.3, 27.2);<br
    />\r\nc) clarifications to some test specifications have been made (7.102, 9.101,
    11.4, 15.1.1, 15.2, 19.1, 20.1);<br />\r\nd) introduction of requirements for
    appliances intended for use in areas open to the public, including external accessible
    surface temperatures (Clause 1, 7.12, 11.8, Table 102);<br />\r\ne) clarification
    of applicable standard for appliances for use by laymen (Clause 1, 7.12);<br />\r\nf)
    exclusion of battery-operated appliances;<br />\r\ng) relocation of cleaning instructions
    from 7.12.1 to 7.12;<br />\r\nh) relocation of 24.101 to 22.108;<br />\r\ni) conciliation
    of the text of IEC 60335-2-50 with other standards under IEC/TC61/MT32.<br />\r\nThis
    Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
