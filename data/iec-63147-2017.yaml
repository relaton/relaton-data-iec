  content: "IEC 63147:2017(E) contains the functional and design criteria for accident
    monitoring instrumentation for new plant designs and nuclear power generating
    stations desiring to perform design modifications. The purpose of this standard
    is to establish selection, design, performance, qualification, and display criteria
    for accident monitoring instrumentation for anticipated operational occurrences,
    design basis events, and severe accidents.<br />\r\nThis standard applies to accident
    monitoring instrumentation intended for use during the following operations:<br
    />\r\n- As required for planned operator action related to accident mitigation,<br
    />\r\n- For assessing plant conditions, safety system performance, and making
    decisions related to plant response to abnormal events,<br />\r\n- For achieving
    and maintaining safe shutdown following an accident<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to the following:<br />\r\n- Accident monitoring instrumentation that
    is intended solely for historical recording or solely for maintenance purposes<br
    />\r\n- Other instrumentation that may be available during accident conditions.<br
    />\r\nThis standard is an adoption of IEEE 497-2016  by IEC.<br />\r\nWhen applied
    in an IAEA / IEC environment this standard is to be used in conjunction with IEC
    TR 63123."
