  content: IEC TS 62396-2:2008 (E) provides guidance related to the testing of microelectronic
    devices for purposes of measuring their susceptibility to single event effects
    (SEE) induced by the atmospheric neutrons. Since the testing can be performed
    in a number of different ways, using different kinds of radiation sources, it
    also shows how the test data can be used to estimate the SEE rate of devices and
    boards due to the atmospheric neutrons in the atmosphere at aircraft altitudes.
