abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63471:2023 provides a recommended DC voltage series for HVDC grids
    with a DC voltage above 1,5 kV. It concerns the selection of a nominal DC voltage
    of multi-terminal HVDC power transmission and distribution systems and meshed
    HVDC networks, grids, rather than a rated DC voltage or highest DC voltage.<br
    />\r\nThere is no stringent requirement to consider this DC voltage series for
    the DC voltage selection for any stand-alone (not forming part of DC Grid) HVDC
    projects, e.g. a point-to-point HVDC power transmission and distribution system.
    However, in order to facilitate the later progression towards larger HVDC systems
    in the future the use of standardized DC voltages is very useful. At later stages,
    with multi-terminal systems and meshed HVDC grids, the use of harmonized voltages
    will indeed become essential in order to optimize both capital and operational
    costs. Also, for entirely new projects, system planning should include this outlook
    and can benefit from the use of the recommended DC voltage series."
