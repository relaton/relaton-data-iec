abstract:
- content: "<p>This document:</p><p>— specifies the required processes implemented
    in the engineering activities that result in requirements for systems and software
    products (including services) throughout the life cycle;</p><p>— provides guidelines
    for applying the requirements and requirements-related processes described in
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207;</p><p>— specifies the required information
    items produced through the implementation of the requirements processes;</p><p>—
    specifies the required contents of the required information items;</p><p>— provides
    guidelines for the format of the required and related information items.</p><p>This
    document is applicable to:</p><p>— those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288
    and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive
    systems, software and hardware products, and services related to those systems
    and products, regardless of the project scope, product(s), methodology, size or
    complexity;</p><p>— anyone performing requirements engineering activities to aid
    in ensuring that their application of the requirements engineering processes conforms
    to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and/or ISO/IEC/IEEE12207;</p><p>— those who use or plan
    to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive
    systems, software and hardware products and services related to those systems
    and products, regardless of the project scope, product(s), methodology, size or
    complexity;</p><p>— anyone performing requirements engineering activities to aid
