abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148:2018 This document:<br />\r\n— specifies the required
    processes implemented in the engineering activities that result in requirements
    for systems and software products (including services) throughout the life cycle;<br
    />\r\n— provides guidelines for applying the requirements and requirements-related
    processes described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207;<br />\r\n— specifies
    the required information items produced through the implementation of the requirements
    processes;<br />\r\n— specifies the required contents of the required information
    items;<br />\r\n— provides guidelines for the format of the required and related
    information items.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to:<br />\r\n— those who
    use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 on projects dealing
    with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, software and hardware products,
    and services related to those systems and products, regardless of the project
    scope, product(s), methodology, size or complexity;<br />\r\n— anyone performing
    requirements engineering activities to aid in ensuring that their application
    of the requirements engineering processes conforms to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and/or
    ISO/IEC/IEEE12207;<br />\r\n— those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289
    on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, software
    and hardware products and services related to those systems and products, regardless
    of the project scope, product(s), methodology, size or complexity;<br />\r\n—
    anyone performing requirements engineering activities to aid in ensuring that
    the information items developed during the application of requirements engineering
    processes conforms to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289."
