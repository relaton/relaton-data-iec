abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 10373-9:2011 defines test methods for characteristics of identification
    cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. It is specific to optical
    memory cards that use the holographic recording method technology. Each test method
    is crossâ€‘referenced to one or more base standards, i.e. ISO/IEC 7810 or one or
    more of the supplementary International Standards that define the information
    storage technologies employed in identification card applications.
