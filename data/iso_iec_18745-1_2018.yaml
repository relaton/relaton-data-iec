abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18745-1:2018 This document provides a set of instructions for
    evaluation of MRPs which may incorporate contactless integrated circuits. This
    evaluation is an instrument to establish the ability in principle of a specific
    type of document to fulfil the requirements of use. It supplies a structured approach
    to evaluate MRPs by:<br />\r\n— defining reproducible stress methods to submit
    the document(s) under evaluation to specific stress or environmental conditions;<br
    />\r\n— defining reproducible evaluation methods to measure numerical values for
    specific document properties;<br />\r\n— defining test sequences that specify
    the order in which stress methods and evaluation methods are to be performed;<br
    />\r\n— defining test plans to link specific user requirements to test sequences
    and related parameters.<br />\r\nIt specifies the minimum criteria to be achieved
    in order to meet ICAO's expectations for durability of fully personalized MRPs."
