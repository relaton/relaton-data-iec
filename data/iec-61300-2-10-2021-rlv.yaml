  content: "IEC 61300-2-10:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-10:2021
    evaluates the effect of loads which is possible to occur when fibre optic devices
    are exposed to critical situations such as being stepped on, being run over by
    vehicle tyres, when an evenly-distributed static load is applied to the top surface
    of a street cabinet or when a load is applied to a street cabinet's open door.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of testing an evenly distributed
    static load applied on the top surface of a street cabinet;<br />\r\n- addition
    of testing a static load applied to a street cabinet door;<br />\r\n- addition
    of descriptions to perform the test at a specified temperature other as specified
    in the standard atmospheric conditions and addition of test temperature(s) in
    Table 1;<br />\r\n- update of the severities according to IEC 61753-1:2018."
