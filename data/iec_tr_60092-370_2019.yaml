abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 60092-370:2019 gives guidance and lays down the basic recommendations
    for the selection and installation of shipboard and offshore unit cables intended
    for electrical systems used in both essential and non-essential analogue or digital
    signal communication, transmission and control networks, including types suitable
    for high-frequency signals (i.e. signals with a frequency of more than 105 Hz).
    These cables are not suitable for direct connection to low impedance supplies.
    Where such cables are required, attention is drawn to IEC 60092-353. Cables intended
    to have limited circuit integrity (fire resistance) when affected by fire are
    not covered by this document. Fibre optical cables are not included. Sub-sea or
    umbilical cables are not included. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical change with respect
    to the previous edition: 30 V AC was added in voltage rating for data cables.'
