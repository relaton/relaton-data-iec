  content: "IEC PAS 63166:2018(E) This book 7 defines several LED modules. Each LED
    module has a rectangular shape and the only restriction to the light emitting
    surface is that no light is emitted in the direction of the reference plane of
    the LED module.<br />\r\nThis Book 1 defines the common concepts that underlie
    the Zhaga interface specifications. In addition, this Book 1 specifies general
    requirements for Zhaga compliant LED Light Engines, associated components and
    Luminaires."
