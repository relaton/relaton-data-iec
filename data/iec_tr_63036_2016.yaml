abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63036:2016(E) specifies the electrical interface and test procedures
    for the control by mains voltage phase-cut dimming of the brightness of mains
    operated electronic lighting equipment intended to be controlled by mains voltage
    phase-cut dimmers, such as LED integrated lamps, and light sources with external
    control gear. Electronic switches that use a comparable circuitry to a phase-cut
    dimmer but do not contain means for the adjustability of the phase-cut angle should
    fulfill the same requirements as a phase-cut dimmer. Safety requirements are not
    covered by this document, but by respective product standards.
