abstract:
- content: "IEC 60674-3-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60674-3-1:2021
    gives the requirements for biaxially oriented polypropylene film having a smooth
    or rough surface, corona treated when required for vacuum metallization. The films
    are for use as dielectric in capacitors. Materials which conform to this specification
    meet established levels of performance. However, the selection of a material by
    a user for a specific application is based on the actual requirements necessary
    for adequate performance in that application and not based on this specification
    alone. Safety warning: It is the responsibility of the user of the methods contained
    or referred to in this document to ensure that they are used in a safe manner.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1998 and
    Amendment 1:2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- this document has been completely revised editorially and
    technically and included in the IEC 60674 series of standards;<br />\r\n- the
    test methods have been updated to reflect todayâ€™s state of the art."
