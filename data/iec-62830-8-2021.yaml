  content: IEC 62830-8:2021(E) specifies terms, definitions, symbols, test, and evaluation
    methods used to determine the performance characteristics of flexible and stretchable
    supercapacitor for practical use in low power electronics such as energy storage
    devices for energy harvesting, flexible and stretchable electronics, low-power
    devices, IoT applications, etc. This document is applicable to all the flexible
    and stretchable supercapacitor for consumers and manufacturers, without any limitations
    of device technology and size.
