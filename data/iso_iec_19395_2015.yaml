abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19395:2015 provides Messages that facilitate integrated or \"smart\" monitoring
    and control of Resources in those islands. The Messages are exchanged between
    the Management Function and Resources. ISO/IEC 19395:2015 acknowledges that those
    Resources may be composed of other Resources (e.g. a rack may contain servers,
    ventilators, etc.). In addition, e.g. those servers may be viewed from their computing,
    energy consumption or dissipation aspects which ISO/IEC 19395:2015 models as Resource
    Components and groups into IT, power and fluid Domains, respectively."
