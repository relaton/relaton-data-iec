abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 19395:2015 provides Messages
    that facilitate integrated or "smart" monitoring and control of Resources in those
    islands. The Messages are exchanged between the Management Function and Resources.
    ISO/IEC 19395:2015 acknowledges that those Resources may be composed of other
    Resources (e.g. a rack may contain servers, ventilators, etc.). In addition, e.g.
    those servers may be viewed from their computing, energy consumption or dissipation
    aspects which ISO/IEC 19395:2015 models as Resource Components and groups into
    IT, power and fluid Domains, respectively.</p>
