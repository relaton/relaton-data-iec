abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19793:2015 defines use of the unified modelling language (UML
    2.4.1 superstructure specification, ISO/IEC 19505-2, for expressing system specifications
    in terms of the viewpoint specifications defined by the reference model of open
    distributed processing (RM-ODP, Rec. ITU-T X.901 to X.904 | ISO/IEC 10746 Parts
    1 to 4) and the Enterprise Language (Rec. ITU-T X.911 | ISO/IEC 15414). It covers:</p><p>a)
    the expression of a system specification in terms of RM-ODP viewpoint specifications
    using defined UML concepts and extensions (e.g., structuring rules, technology
    mappings, etc.);</p><p>b) relationships between the resultant RM-ODP viewpoint
    specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19793:2015 is intended for the following audiences:</p><p>?
    ODP modellers who want to use the UML notation for expressing their ODP specifications
    in a graphical and standard way;</p><p>? UML modellers who want to use the RM-ODP
    concepts and mechanisms to structure their UML system specifications;</p><p>?
    modelling tool suppliers, who wish to develop UML-based tools that are capable
    of expressing RMâ€‘ODP viewpoint specifications.</p>"
