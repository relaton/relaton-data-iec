abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 19793:2015 defines use
    of the unified modelling language (UML 2.4.1 superstructure specification, ISO/IEC
    19505-2, for expressing system specifications in terms of the viewpoint specifications
    defined by the reference model of open distributed processing (RM-ODP, Rec. ITU-T
    X.901 to X.904 | ISO/IEC 10746 Parts 1 to 4) and the Enterprise Language (Rec.
    ITU-T X.911 | ISO/IEC 15414). It covers:</p><p>a) the expression of a system specification
    in terms of RM-ODP viewpoint specifications using defined UML concepts and extensions
    (e.g., structuring rules, technology mappings, etc.);</p><p>b) relationships between
    the resultant RM-ODP viewpoint specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19793:2015 is intended
    for the following audiences:</p><p>? ODP modellers who want to use the UML notation
    for expressing their ODP specifications in a graphical and standard way;</p><p>?
    UML modellers who want to use the RM-ODP concepts and mechanisms to structure
    their UML system specifications;</p><p>? modelling tool suppliers, who wish to
    develop UML-based tools that are capable of expressing RM‑ODP viewpoint specifications.</p>
