  content: IEC TS 62271-313:2025 is applicable to direct current circuit-breakers
    (hereafter termed DC circuit-breakers) for indoor or outdoor installation having
    direct voltages of 100 kV and above for operation on DC transmission and distribution
    systems. This document includes the (mechanical) switching devices, including
    the residual current interruption devices, and their operating devices, power
    electronic switches, primary auxiliary circuits and energy dissipation systems,
    as well as their controls. Depending on design and system needs, operation can
    be for one current direction only (unidirectional) or for both directions (bidirectional).
