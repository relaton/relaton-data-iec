abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-7-6:2019(E), which is a technical report, is focused on building
    application / function profiles and specifies a methodology to define Basic Application
    Profiles (BAPs). These Basic Application Profiles provide a framework for interoperable
    interaction within or between typical substation automation functions. BAPs are
    intended to define a subset of features of IEC 61850 in order to facilitate interoperability
    in a modular way in practical applications.<br />\r\nIt is the intention of this
    document to provide a common and generic way to describe the functional behaviour
    of a specific application function in the domain of power utility automation systems
    as a common denominator of various possible interpretations/implementations of
    using IEC 61850."
