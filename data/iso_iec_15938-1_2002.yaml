abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines a Multimedia Content Description
    Interface, specifying a series of interfaces</p><p>from system to application
    level to allow disparate systems to interchange information about multimedia content.
    It</p><p>describes the architecture for systems, a language for extensions and
    specific applications, description tools in the</p><p>audio and visual domains,
    as well as tools that are not specific to audio-visual domains.</p><p>This part
    of ISO/IEC 15938 specifies system level functionalities for the communication
    of multimedia content</p><p>descriptions. ISO/IEC 15938-1 provides a specification
    which will:</p><p> enable development of ISO/IEC 15938 receiving sub-systems,
    called ISO/IEC 15938 Terminal, or Terminal in</p><p>short, to receive and assemble
    possibly partitioned and compressed multimedia content descriptions</p><p> provide
    rules for the preparation of multimedia content descriptions consisting of the
    tools specified in Parts 3,</p><p>4 and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938 for efficient transport
    and storage.</p><p>The decoding process within the ISO/IEC 15938 Terminal is normative.
    The rules mentioned provide guidance for</p><p>the preparation and encoding of
    multimedia content descriptions without leading to a unique encoded</p><p>representation
    of such descriptions.</p><p>This part of the MPEG-7 Standard is intended to be
    implemented in conjunction with other parts of the standard. In</p><p>particular,
    MPEG-7 Part 1: Systems assumes some knowledge of Part 2: Description Definition
    Language (DDL) in</p><p>its normative syntactic definitions of Descriptors and
    Description Schemes, as well as in the processing of schema</p><p>and descriptions.
    The methods for obtaining the descriptions to which the encoding techniques in
    this part refer are</p><p>defined in Parts 3, 4, and 5 of ISO/IEC 15938.</p><p>MPEG-7
    is an extensible standard. The standard method of extending the standard beyond
    the Description</p><p>Schemes provided in the standard is to define new ones in
    the DDL, and to make those DSs as accessible as the</p><p>instantiated descriptions.
    Further details are available in Part 2.</p>"
