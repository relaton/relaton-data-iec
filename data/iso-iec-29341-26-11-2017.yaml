    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-11:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service type referred to herein as the MediaManagement service. </p>
    <p>The MediaManagement service enables the feature to set-up a media session on a Telephony Client (TC), under the control of a Telephony Control Point (TelCP). This service provides the following functions:</p>
    <p>-           Set up a media session to send and/or receive media streams between a TC and a TS. To set up a media session, The MediaManagement service provides an interface for a TelCP to negotiate the media capabilities (e.g., codec types, IP address, port number etc.) between a TC and a TS. This ensures a TelCP to select a common set of the media capabilities to be used to send and/or receive media streams between a TS and a TC. After the media session is established, the TC starts sending and/or receiving media streams based on the media chapabilities negotiated between the TC and the TS.</p>
    <p>-           The mechanism to modify the media capabilities of an existing media session. For instance, if a media session is created for sending and receiving an audio media stream, it is possible to modify the media session for sending and receiving a video media stream.</p>
    <p>-           The mechanism to terminate a media session.</p>
