abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines the procedure executed by
    a Member of a distributed inter-process communication (IPC) facility (DIF) or
    distributed application facility (DAF) to initialize a New Member as a fully functioning
    Member. This procedure is used when it is likely the new Member has not previously
    been a Member of the DIF or DAF in the near past. This document is defined for
    use with DIFs, but can be used equally well by a DAF that wants to assign synonyms
    with a scope limited to the DAF.</p>
