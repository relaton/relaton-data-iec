  content: "IEC 62481-2:2013(E) describes DLNA Media Format Profiles applicable to
    the DLNA Device Classes defined in IEC 62481-1. Media Format Profiles are defined
    for each of the following media classes: Audio, Image, and AV. In addition, Profile
    ID values that identify media collections and printer XHTML documents are also
    introduced. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2007, and constitutes a technical revision. It includes the following changes:<br
    />\r\n- addition of new optional media format profiles for Audio and AV content;<br
    />\r\n- addition of mandatory media format profiles for the CVP-1 Device Profile;<br
    />\r\n- includes updates to resolve interoperability issues. A bilingual version
    of this publication may be issued at a later date."
