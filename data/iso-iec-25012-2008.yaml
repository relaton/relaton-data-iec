    <p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 defines a general data quality model for data retained in a structured format within a computer system.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 can be used to establish data quality requirements, define data quality measures, or plan and perform data quality evaluations. It could be used, for example, </p>
    <ul>
    <li>to define and evaluate data quality requirements in data production, acquisition and integration processes,</li>
    <li>to identify data quality assurance criteria, also useful for re-engineering, assessment and improvement of data,</li>
    <li>to evaluate the compliance of data with legislation and/or requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 categorizes quality attributes into fifteen characteristics considered by two points of view: inherent and system dependent. Data quality characteristics will be of varying importance and priority to different stakeholders.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25012:2008 is intended to be used in conjunction with the other parts of the SQuaRE series of International Standards, and with ISO/IEC 9126-1 until superseded by ISO/IEC 25010.</p>
