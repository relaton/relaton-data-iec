abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-26-12:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service type referred to
    herein as Messaging service.<br />\r\nThe Messaging service is a UPnP service
    that allows control points to use the messaging features provided by a Telephony
    Server (TS) or a Telephony Client (TC).<br />\r\nIt provides in the UPnP network
    the overall set of messaging capabilities of a phone (e.g., smartphone, IP phone,
    VoIP gateway, etc.), as the role of a TS. Additionally, or as an alternative,
    a device with the role of a TC can provide the Messaging service via UPnP Telephony.<br
    />\r\nThis service provides the control points with the following functionalities:<br
    />\r\n- Page Mode Messaging (e.g., e-Mail, SMS, MMS, etc.): notification of incoming
    messages, reading messages, sending a message, deleting a message.<br />\r\n-
    Session Mode Messaging (e.g., Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.): notification of incoming
    messages, retrieving and sending the messages within a session, creating, modifying
    or closing a messaging session.<br />\r\n- File transfer session, to transfer
    the files in near real time.<br />\r\nThis service does not provide the following
    functionalities:<br />\r\n- Connection to a remote server for sending or receiving
    the messages (e.g., WAN side);<br />\r\n- Rendering of message notifications and
    messages to the end user;<br />\r\n- Configuring the Messaging service with account
    for connecting to remote servers."
