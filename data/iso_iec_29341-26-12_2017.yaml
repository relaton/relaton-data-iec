abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-12:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service
    type referred to herein as Messaging service.</p><p>The Messaging service is a
    UPnP service that allows control points to use the messaging features provided
    by a Telephony Server (TS) or a Telephony Client (TC).</p><p>It provides in the
    UPnP network the overall set of messaging capabilities of a phone (e.g., smartphone,
    IP phone, VoIP gateway, etc.), as the role of a TS. Additionally, or as an alternative,
    a device with the role of a TC can provide the Messaging service via UPnP Telephony.</p><p>This
    service provides the control points with the following functionalities:</p><p>-
    Page Mode Messaging (e.g., e-Mail, SMS, MMS, etc.): notification of incoming messages,
    reading messages, sending a message, deleting a message.</p><p>- Session Mode
    Messaging (e.g., Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.): notification of incoming messages,
    retrieving and sending the messages within a session, creating, modifying or closing
    a messaging session.</p><p>- File transfer session, to transfer the files in near
    real time.</p><p>This service does not provide the following functionalities:</p><p>-
    Connection to a remote server for sending or receiving the messages (e.g., WAN
    side);</p><p>- Rendering of message notifications and messages to the end user;</p><p>-
    Configuring the Messaging service with account for connecting to remote servers;</p>"
