abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 33001:2015 provides a repository for key terminology relating to
    process assessment. It gives overall information on the concepts of process assessment,
    the application of process assessment for evaluating the achievement of process
    quality characteristics, and the application of the results of process assessment
    to the conduct of process management. ISO/IEC 33001:2015 provides an introduction
    to the ISO/IEC 330xx family of standards for process assessment; it describes
    how the parts of the family of standards for process assessment fit together and
    provides guidance for their selection and use. It explains the requirements contained
