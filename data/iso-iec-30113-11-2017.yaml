    <p>ISO/IEC 30113-11:2017 defines single-point gestures for common system actions used in information and communication technology (ICT) systems. It specifies movements for clear and classified gestures recognized by the systems and applications. The single-point gestures are performed using an input device (e.g. a mouse, a stylus, etc.) or a body part (e.g. a fingertip, a hand, etc.). These single-point gestures are intended to operate in a consistent manner regardless of the system, platform, application or device.</p>
    <p>NOTE       ICT systems include, but are not limited to, digital televisions, set-top boxes, video game consoles, communication devices, Internet devices, entertainment devices and personal computers.</p>
