  content: "The concept of future sustainable transport (FST) recognizes the need
    to brings together the social, economic and environmental aspects of transport
    to ensure its future sustainability.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC technology report
    provides an overview of the key technologies necessary for sustainable transport
    and the role of standardization for deploying and promoting them. It examines
    the concept of sustainable electrified transport (SET), which addresses the systems
    and infrastructure aspects to the integration of transport and energy and highlights
    the contributions that the IEC can provide. Based on an analysis of use-cases,
    the report determines the current gaps in standardization relevant to the IEC
    where further activities can be undertaken.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis report was
    developed by <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:186:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:23128,25\">IEC
