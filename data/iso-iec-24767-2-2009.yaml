  content: ISO/IEC 24767-2:2009(E) specifies security in a home network for equipment
    with limited IT capability. Secure Communication Protocol for Middleware (SCPM)
    is designed to support network security for equipment which is not capable of
    supporting Internet security protocols. SCPM provides the security services at
    the network layer and the protocol does not rely on any specific media transmission.
