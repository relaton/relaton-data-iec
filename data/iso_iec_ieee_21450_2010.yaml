abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 21450:2010 provides a common basis for members of the ISO/IEC/IEEE
    21451 series of International Standards to be interoperable. It defines the functions
    that are to be performed by a transducer interface module (TIM) and the common
    characteristics for all devices that implement the TIM. It specifies the formats
    for Transducer Electronic Data Sheets (TEDS). It defines a set of commands to
    facilitate the setup and control of the TIM as well as reading and writing the
    data used by the system. Application programming interfaces (APIs) are defined
    to facilitate communications with the TIM and with applications.
