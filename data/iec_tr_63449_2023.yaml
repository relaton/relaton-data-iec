abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63449:2023 presents a study of the impact of high dynamic range
    (HDR) technologies with \"dynamic metadata\" on TV luminance and power consumption.
    It compares the power consumption of content with dynamic metadata to the same
    content without dynamic metadata. Non-dynamic \"static metadata\" HDR technologies
    such as HDR10 and non-metadata HDR such as HLG, were previously studied in IEC
    TR 63274:2021.<br />\r\nThis document also reviews the current HDR TV market and
    analyses existing HDR TV power measurement methods and considerations for any
    changes to those power measurement standards.<br />\r\nWhile this document studies
    the results of content that include Dolby VisionÂ® and HDR10+ dynamic metadata,
    any comparison of these two technologies is outside of the scope of this document."
