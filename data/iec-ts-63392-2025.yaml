  content: "IEC TS 63392:2025 specifies a test method for evaluating the basic fire
    behaviour of modules used in concentrating systems with a maximum DC system voltage
    of 1 500 V or less. Since the concentrator module may be exposed to flames due
    to flying embers or fire may be caused by the module itself due to hot spots or
    arching (internal fire), the tests outlined in this document are conducted in
    these two modes.<br />\r\nApplicable fire testing may be required by local codes
    but are not covered in this document.<br />\r\nCPV system or CPV modules mounted
    in or on buildings, shall fulfil national building and construction codes, regulations,
    and requirements and are not covered by this Technical Specification. If national
    or local codes define fire test requirements, they should be followed. If such
    requirements are not available, the following international and national standards
    give information for tests, which could be used: ISO 5657, ENV 1187-1 to -4, ANSI/UL
    790, EN 13501-1."
