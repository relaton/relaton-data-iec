    <p>ISO/IEC 19752:2004 is limited to evaluation of toner cartridge yield for toner containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and toner cartridges without a photoconductor) for monochrome electrophotographic printers. ISO/IEC 19752:2004 can also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional device that has a digital input-printing path (i.e. multi-function devices that contain printer components).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19752:2004 is only intended for the measurement of toner cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p>
