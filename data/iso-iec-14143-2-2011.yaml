    <p>ISO/IEC 14143-2:2011:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>establishes a framework for the conformity evaluation of a Candidate FSM Method against the provisions of ISO/IEC 14143-1;</li>
    <li>describes a process for conformity evaluation of whether a Candidate FSM Method meets the (type) requirements of ISO/IEC 14143-1 such that it is an actual FSM method, i.e. they are of the same type;</li>
    <li>describes the requirements for performing a conformity evaluation in order to ensure repeatability of the conformity evaluation process, as well as consistency of decisions on conformity and the final result;</li>
    <li>aims to ensure that the output from the conformity evaluation process is objective, impartial, consistent, repeatable, complete and auditable;</li>
    <li>provides informative guidelines for determining the competence of the conformity evaluation teams;</li>
    <li>provides an example checklist to assist in the conformity evaluation of a Candidate FSM Method; and</li>
    <li>provides an example template for the conformity evaluation report.</li>
