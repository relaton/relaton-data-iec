    of the API;<br />\r\n- further introductory explanations regarding the content
    and use of the API beyond those found in ISO/IEC 13066â€‘1:2011, Annex A;<br />\r\n-
    an overview of the main properties, including<br />\r\n    - of user interface
    elements,<br />\r\n    - of how to get and set focus, and<br />\r\n    - of communication
    mechanisms in the API;<br />\r\n- a discussion of design considerations for the
    API (e.g. pointers to external sources of information on accessibility guidance
    related to using the API);<br />\r\n- information on extending the API (and where
    this is appropriate);<br />\r\n- an introduction to the programming interface
    of the API (including pointers to external sources of information).<br />\r\nIt
    will provide this information as an introduction to the Java API to assist the
    following:<br />\r\n- IT system level developers who create custom controls and/or
    interface to them;<br />\r\n- AT developers involved in programming \"hardware
    to software\" and \"software to software\" interactions."
