abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63037:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC TR 63037:2019 provides guidance
    to controlgear/integrated lamp designers for the development of products suitable
    to operate with future phase-cut dimmers. It describes the possible voltage signals
    and the expected response of the controlgear/integrated lamps. This document describes
    the expected response of controlgear during all operation states of a phase-cut
    lighting system and provides a complete understanding of the requirements for
    phase-cut dimmers. The response of a phase-cut dimmer is described in IEC 60669-2‑1:—,
    Annex EE. This document specifies the system performance aspects and test procedures
    for the control by mains voltage phase-cut dimming of the brightness of mains
    operated electronic lighting equipment intended to be controlled by mains voltage
    phase-cut dimmers, such as LED integrated lamps and light sources with external
    controlgear. Safety requirements are not covered by this document, but by respective
    product standards. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- emission of audible noise;<br />\r\n- ghosting caused by issues
    that are not related to the power supply of the dimmer or synchronization;<br
    />\r\n- stability of phase angle waveform (for the dimmer), including symmetry
    and stability tests;<br />\r\n- flicker of light loads;<br />\r\n- repetitive
    ring up voltage;<br />\r\n- dimming range; and<br />\r\n- number of switching
    cycles have been added.</p>"
