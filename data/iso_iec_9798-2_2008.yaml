abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9798-2:2008 specifies entity authentication mechanisms using symmetric
    encipherment algorithms. Four of the mechanisms provide entity authentication
    between two entities where no trusted third party is involved; two of these are
    mechanisms to unilaterally authenticate one entity to another, while the other
    two are mechanisms for mutual authentication of two entities. The remaining mechanisms
    require a trusted third party for the establishment of a common secret key, and
    realize mutual or unilateral entity authentication.The mechanisms specified in
    ISO/IEC 9798-2:2008 use time variant parameters such as time stamps, sequence
    numbers, or random numbers to prevent valid authentication information from being
    accepted at a later time or more than once.If no trusted third party is involved
    and a time stamp or sequence number is used, one pass is needed for unilateral
    authentication, while two passes are needed to achieve mutual authentication.
    If no trusted third party is involved and a challenge and response method employing
    random numbers is used, two passes are needed for unilateral authentication, while
    three passes are required to achieve mutual authentication. If a trusted third
    party is involved, any additional communication between an entity and the trusted
    third party requires two extra passes in the communication exchange.
