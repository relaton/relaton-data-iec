  content: IEC/IEEE 60255-118-1:2018 is used for synchronized phasor measurement systems
    in power systems. It defines a synchronized phasor (synchrophasor), frequency,
    and rate of change of frequency measurements. It describes time tag and synchronization
    requirements for measurement of all three of these quantities. It specifies methods
    for evaluating these measurements and requirements for compliance with the standard
    under both static and dynamic conditions. It defines a phasor measurement unit
    (PMU), which can be a stand-alone physical unit or a functional unit within another
    physical unit. This document does not specify hardware, software or a method for
    computing phasors, frequency, or rate of change of frequency.
