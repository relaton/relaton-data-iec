  content: "The need for Electrical Energy Storage (EES) will increase significantly
    over the coming years. With the growing penetration of wind and solar, surplus
    energy could be captured to help reduce generation costs and increase energy supply.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nEES will play an important role in maintaining a continuous and
    flexible power supply, while balancing the grid, integrating remote and distributed
    energy generation and meeting varying demands. The publication identifies the
    challenges and outlines available technologies. It includes recommendations on
    research, regulation and standardization.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis White Paper
    was developed with CTOs (Chief Technology Officers) of major technology companies
    who participate in the <a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">IEC MSB</a> (Market Strategy
    Board) in cooperation with the German Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy and
    other leading experts.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for
    <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/electrical-energy-storage\">free download</a>."
