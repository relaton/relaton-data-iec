- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19464:2014 defines the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), an open internet
    protocol for business messaging. It defines a binary wire-level protocol that
    allows for the reliable exchange of business messages between two parties. AMQP
    has a layered architecture and the specification is organized as a set of parts
    that reflects that architecture. - Part 1 defines the AMQP type system and encoding.
    - Part 2 defines the AMQP transport layer, an efficient, binary, peer-to-peer
    protocol for transporting messages between two processes over a network. - Part
    3 defines the AMQP message format, with a concrete encoding. - Part 4 defines
    how interactions can be grouped within atomic transactions. - Part 5 defines the
    AMQP security layers."
