abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 19464:2014 defines the
    Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), an open internet protocol for business
    messaging. It defines a binary wire-level protocol that allows for the reliable
    exchange of business messages between two parties. AMQP has a layered architecture
    and the specification is organized as a set of parts that reflects that architecture.</p><ul><li>Part
    1 defines the AMQP type system and encoding.</li><li>Part 2 defines the AMQP transport
    layer, an efficient, binary, peer-to-peer protocol for transporting messages between
    two processes over a network.</li><li>Part 3 defines the AMQP message format,
    with a concrete encoding.</li><li>Part 4 defines how interactions can be grouped
    within atomic transactions.</li><li>Part 5 defines the AMQP security layers.</li></ul>
