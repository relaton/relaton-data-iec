abstract:
- content: IEC 62715-6-3:2020 (E) is to define the standard test methods to evaluate
    the mechanical robustness of flexible display modules, especially mechanical robustness
    regarding impact and hardness, which include displays such as liquid crystal displays
    (LCDs), e-paper, and organic light emitting diode (OLED) displays, against external
    forces applied to a panel.
