abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63158:2018(E) describes an objective stroboscopic effect visibility
    (SVM) meter, which can be applied for performance testing of lighting equipment
    under different operational conditions.<br />\r\nThe stroboscopic effects considered
    in this document are limited to the objective assessment by a human observer of
    visible stroboscopic effects of temporal light modulation of lighting equipment
    in general indoor applications, with typical indoor light levels (> 100 lx) and
    with moderate movements of an observer or nearby handled object (< 4 m/s). Details
    on restriction of the applicability of the stroboscopic effect visibility measure
    is given in Clause A.1.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of July 2018
    have been included in this copy."
