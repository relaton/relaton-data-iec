abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of a 12,7 mm wide, 128-track magnetic tape cartridge, to enable physical interchangeability
    of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of the recorded
    signals, a format - called Digital Linear Tape 3 Extended (DLT 3-XT) - and a recording
    method, thereby allowing data interchange between drives. Together with a labelling
    standard, for instance International Standard ISO 1001 for Magnetic Tape Labelling,
    it allows full data interchange by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.</p>"
