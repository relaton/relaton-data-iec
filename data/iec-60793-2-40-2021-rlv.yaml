  content: "IEC 60793-2-40:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60793-2-40:2021
    is applicable to category A4 optical multimode fibres and the related subcategories
    A4a, A4b, A4c, A4d, A4e, A4g, A4h and A4i. These fibres have a plastic core and
    plastic cladding and may have step-index, multi-step index or graded-index profiles.
    The fibres are used in information transmission equipment and other applications
    employing similar light transmitting techniques, and in fibre optic cables. Table
    1 summarizes some of the salient characteristics and applications of these fibres.
    This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2015.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    revision of NA range of A4a.2;<br />\r\n- addition of a new subcategory A4i;<br
    />\r\n- deletion of the subcategory A4f and of Annex F."
