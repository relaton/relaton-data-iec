    <p>This part of Publicly Available Specification ISO/IEC 29341 specifies the characteristics of a networked service that offers sensor and/or actuator data transport capabilities to an independent networked entity known as a control point. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-30-12:2017 defines the service SensorTransportGeneric:1 (in short TransportGeneric), which identifies Level 1 of the UPnP IoT Management and Control TransportGeneric:1 Service [10]. This Publicly Available Specification is applicable to Standardized DCPs of the UPnP Forum which include this service.</p>
    <p>This service enables UPnP clients to access sensors and/or actuators without needing a detailed knowledge of the target sensor or actuator or its connectivity to the UPnP network. Sensors and Actuators are instead treated a generic data sources or sinks.  </p>
    <p>This service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [1]. It defines a service type referred to herein as TransportGeneric service.</p>
