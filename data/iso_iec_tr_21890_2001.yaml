abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 21890:2001 The purpose of this Technical Report is to investigate the interoperability
    of Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs) and Internet Protocol (IP) networks,
    with a view to identifying possible scenarios for interoperation, problems that
    will have to be solved if particular scenarios are to be pursued further, and
    possible future standardization activities in this area. In particular, the following
    aspects of interoperability are investigated:<br />\r\n- the interworking of PISNs
    and IP networks via a gateway;<br />\r\n- the connection of PISN components via
    IP networks.<br />\r\nFor each of the above, aspects considered include architecture,
    addressing (including use of IP addressing), services, protocols, security, quality
    of service and mobility. This is conducted within the context of leading standards
    for voice and multimedia communication over IP networks, including ITU-T recommendation
    H.323, IETF Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and ITU-T recommendation H.248.<br
    />\r\nPossible future standardization activities resulting from this Technical
    Report can include work items relating to IP networks and work items relating
    to PISNs, as well as work items concerned specifically with interoperability.<br
    />\r\nThe dominant traffic in PISNs is voice, and therefore this Technical Report
    focuses on interoperability considerations for voice traffic. However, many of
    the standards that support voice in an IP network are also applicable to multi-media
    traffic (e.g., voice, video and data). Although in many respects similar to voice,
    fax traffic has slightly different requirements and is not explicitly considered
    in this Technical Report. It could be the subject of further study."
