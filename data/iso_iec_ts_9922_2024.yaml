abstract:
- content: "<p>This document builds upon ISO/IEC 14882 by describing requirements
    for implementations of an interface that computer programs written in the C++
    programming language could use to invoke algorithms with concurrent execution.
    The algorithms described by this document are realizable across a broad class
    of computer architectures. This document is written as a set of differences from
    the base standard.</p><p>Some of the functionality described by this document
    might be considered for standardization in a future version of C++, but it is
    not currently part of ISO/IEC 14882:2020. Some of the functionality in this document
    might never be standardized, and other functionality might be standardized in
    a substantially different form.</p><p>The goal of this document is to build widespread
    existing practice for concurrency in the ISO/IEC 14882:2020 algorithms library.
    It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>"
