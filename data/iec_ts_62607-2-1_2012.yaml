abstract:
- content: "IEC/TS 62607-2-1:2012(E) which is a technical specification, provides
    a standardized method for categorizing a grade of commercial carbon nanotubes
    in terms of their electrical properties to enable a user to select a carbon nanotube
    material suitable for his application. The method is intended to assess whether
    the delivered materials from different production batches of the same production
    process are comparable regarding electrical properties of the final product which
    are related to electrical conductivity. The correlation between the measured parameters
    by the proposed method and a relevant product performance parameter has to be
    established for every application. This specification includes:<br />\r\n- definitions
    of terminology used in this document,<br />\r\n- recommendations for sample preparation,<br
    />\r\n- outlines of the experimental procedures to measure sheet resistance of
    carbon nanotubes in thin films,<br />\r\n- methods of interpretation of results
    and discussion of data analysis,<br />\r\n- case studies and,<br />\r\n- references."
