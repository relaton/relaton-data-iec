  content: "IEC 61000-4-10:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-10:2016 specifies
    the immunity requirements, test methods, and range of recommended test levels
    for equipment subjected to damped oscillatory magnetic disturbances related to
    medium voltage and high voltage sub-stations. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 1993 and Amendment 1:2000. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision."
