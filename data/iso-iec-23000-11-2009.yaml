    <p>ISO/IEC 23000-11:2009 specifies a file format which is capable of storage, interchange, management, editing, and presentation of stereoscopic video contents based on the ISO base media file format. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23000-11:2009 specifies the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the file type brand for stereoscopic video contents;</li>
    <li>four stereoscopic video contents composition types, which are widely used and suitable for the 3D mobile display; </li>
    <li>the file structure, which is capable of storage with a single video track or two video tracks for stereoscopic contents;</li>
    <li>the stereoscopic video media information, which includes the visual type information of signaling stereoscopic content composition types, and the stereo_mono_change information for the identification of each fragment in stereo-monoscopic mixed contents;</li>
    <li>the stereoscopic camera and display information, which provides camera, display and visual safety information for stereoscopic contents;</li>
    <li>the track reference type, which tells the track of indicating primary and secondary view sequences in case of using two video tracks for stereoscopic contents;</li>
    <li>the item location, which provides a location of stereoscopic fragments in stereoscopic video contents.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23000-11:2009 provides the overall structure for storing pure stereoscopic video contents and also stereo-monoscopic mixed contents with the stereoscopic-related information in mobile environments.</p>
