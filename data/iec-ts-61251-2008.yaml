  content: "IEC/TS 61251:2008(E) explains many of the factors involved in voltage
    endurance tests on electrical insulating materials and systems. It describes the
    voltage endurance graph, lists test methods illustrating their limitations and
    gives guidance for evaluating the a.c. voltage endurance of insulating materials
    and systems from the results of the tests. The terminology to be used in voltage
    endurance is defined and explained. It should be emphasized that where this technical
    specification is concerned with materials, the results may not be directly applicable
    to the performance of insulating systems. Voltage endurance tests are used to
    compare and evaluate insulating materials with regard to their various applications
    in electrical systems. Determining the ability of electrical insulating materials
    and systems to endure a.c. voltage stress is complex. The results of voltage endurance
    tests are influenced by many factors so this technical specification should only
    be considered as an attempt to present a unified view of voltage endurance for
    simplified planning and analysis. Some documents for the various practical cases
    exist and others are being developed. The main changes with respect to the previous
    edition are listed below:<br />\r\n- extension of the scope to cover electrical
    insulating material and insulation systems;<br />\r\n- removal of references to
    short time dielectric breakdown strength measurements as an indicator of voltage
    endurance."
