  script: Latn
  content: "<p>This document defines a system interface for compiled applications
    and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts. Its purpose is
    to enable a uniform industry standard environment for high-volume applications
    conforming to the LSB. <br />These specifications are composed of two basic parts:
    a common part describing those parts of the interface that remain constant across
    all implementations of the LSB, and an architecture-specific part describing the
    parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture. Together, the common
    part and the relevant architecture-specific part for a single hardware architecture
    provide a complete interface specification for compiled application programs on
    systems that share a common hardware architecture. <br />The LSB contains both
    a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Application Binary Interfaces
    (ABIs). APIs may appear in the source code of portable applications, while the
    compiled binary of that application may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming
    implementation provides all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation system may
    replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or more of the
    underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary interfaces as needed.
    <br />The LSB is primarily a binary interface definition. Not all of the source
    level APIs available to applications may be contained in this specification. <br
    />This is the Itanium™ architecture specific part of the Core module of the Linux
    Standard Base (LSB). This part supplements the common part of the LSB Core module
    with those interfaces that differ between architectures. <br />This part should
    be used in conjunction with LSB Core - Generic, the common part. Whenever a section
    of the common part is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the common
    part includes a reference to the architecture-specific part. This part may also
    contain additional information that is not referenced in the common part. <br
    />Interfaces described in this part of the LSB Core Specification are mandatory
    except where explicitly listed otherwise. Interfaces described in the LSB Core
    module are supplemented by other LSB modules. All other modules depend on the
    presence of LSB Core. </p>"
