abstract:
- content: "Advanced robotics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things are
    transforming how humans and electrotechnical systems interconnect. With the introduction
    of new technologies, it is critically important to ensure that human safety remains
    at the centre of the human-machine relationship.<br /><br />\r\nEach year, several
    million workers are injured on the job. Aside from the economic cost, this is
    the source of immeasurable suffering that is largely preventable.<br /><br />\r\nUsing
    real-life examples, this white paper addresses safety in the future by exploring
    current social trends and initiatives as well as projects that are pioneering
    innovative safety solutions. All of them are based on the concept that safety
    will be integral to systems in which humans and machines closely interface. The
    paper also introduces a collaborative framework – the tripartite system for safety
    – which offers a systematic approach to examining key safety elements.<br /><br
    />\r\nBringing these safety concepts to fruition will require significant standardization
    efforts to mitigate challenges related to decision-making involving machines and
    humans.<br /><br />\r\nThe white paper formulates recommendations both of a general
    nature as well as to the IEC community.<br /><br />\r\nThe white paper was developed
    by the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB) safety in the future project team, directed
    by Dr Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, MSB Convenor, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation, with major
    contributions from the lead project partner, Dr Coen van Gulijk, TNO, the Netherlands.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis IEC White Paper is available for free download."
