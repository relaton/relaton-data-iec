abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 defines the parameters to be determined in any
    Standardized Air Interface Definition in the ISO/IEC 18000 series. The subsequent
    parts of ISO/IEC 18000 provide the specific values for definition of the Air Interface
    Parameters for a particular frequency or type of air interface, from which compliance
    (or non compliance) with ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 can be established. ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004
    also provides description of example conceptual architectures in which these air
    interfaces are often to be utilized.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004 limits its scope
    to transactions and data exchanges across the air interface at Reference Point
    Delta. The means of generating and managing such transactions, other than a requirement
    to achieve the transactional performance determined within ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004,
    are outside its scope, as is the definition or specification of any supporting
    hardware, firmware, software or associated equipment.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18000-1:2004
    is an enabling standard that supports and promotes several RFID implementations
    without making conclusions about the relative technical merits of any available
    option for any possible application.</p>"
