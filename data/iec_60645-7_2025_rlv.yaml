abstract:
- content: "IEC 60645-7:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60645-7:2025
    applies to instruments designed for the measurement of auditory evoked potentials
    from the inner ear, the auditory nerve, and the brainstem, evoked by either acoustic
    or vibratory stimuli of short duration. This document defines the characteristics
    to be specified by the manufacturer, specifies performance requirements for two
    types of instruments (screening and diagnostic/clinical), and specifies the functions
    to be provided on these types. It also specifies a means of describing the physical
    characteristics, in terms of electrical waveforms, of audiometric reference and
    test signals of short duration used with auditory evoked potential equipment and
    other equipment (e.g. otoacoustic emission instruments), and methods for their
    measurement. The purpose of this document is to ensure that measurements made
    under comparable test conditions with different instruments complying with this
    document will be consistent. This document is not intended to restrict development
    or incorporation of new features, nor to discourage innovative approaches. Evoked
    response measurement using the application of electric stimuli to a subject is
    beyond the scope of this document."
