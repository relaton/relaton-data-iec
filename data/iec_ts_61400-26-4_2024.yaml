abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-26-4:2024, which is a Technical Specification, specifies
    terms and information categories for identification and reporting of reliability
    metrics. The definitions are applicable to key components, any number of wind
    turbines, fleets of wind turbine types, a wind power station or a portfolio of
    wind power stations. The wind power station is made up of all WTGSs (Wind Turbine
    Generator Systems), functional services and balance of plant elements as seen
    from the point of common coupling.<br />\r\nThis document provides guidelines
    regarding reliability methodologies with informative annexes regarding use.<br
    />\r\nIt expands on the information model in IEC 61400-26-1, recognizing that
    availability and reliability are interrelated."
