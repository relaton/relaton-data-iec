abstract:
- content: "IEC 60071-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60071-2:2018 constitutes
    application guidelines and deals with the selection of insulation levels of equipment
    or installations for three-phase electrical systems. It gives guidance for the
    determination of the rated withstand voltages for ranges I and II of IEC 60071-1
    and to justify the association of these rated values with the standardized highest
    voltages for equipment. It covers three-phase systems with nominal voltages above
    1 kV. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the annex on clearance in air to assure a
    specified impulse withstand voltage installation is deleted because the annex
    in IEC 60071-1 is overlapped;<br />\r\nb) 4.2 and 4.3 on surge arresters are updated;<br
    />\r\nc) 4.3.5 on very-fast-front overvoltages is revised. Annex J on insulation
    co-ordination for very-fast-front overvoltages in UHV substations is added;<br
    />\r\nd) Annex H on atmospheric correction â€“ altitude correction is added.<br
    />\r\ne) Annex I on evaluation method of non-standard lightning overvoltage shape
    is added.</p>\r\nIt has the status of a horizontal standard in accordance with
    IEC Guide 108."
