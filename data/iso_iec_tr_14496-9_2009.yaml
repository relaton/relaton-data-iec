abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 14496-9:2009 specifies descriptions of the main video coding
    tools in hardware description language (HDL) form. Such alternative descriptions
    to the ones that are reported in ISO/IEC 14496-2, ISO/IEC 14496-5 and ISO/IEC
    TR 14496-7 correspond to the need of providing the public with conformant standard
    descriptions that are closer to the starting point of the development of codec
    implementations than textual descriptions or pure software descriptions. ISO/IEC
    TR 14496-9:2009 contains conformant descriptions of video tools that have been
    validated within the recommendation ISO/IEC TR 14496-7.</p>"
