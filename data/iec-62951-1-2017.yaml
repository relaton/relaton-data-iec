  content: IEC 62951-1:2017(E) specifies a bending test method to measure the electromechanical
    properties or flexibility of conductive thin films deposited or bonded on flexible
    non-conductive substrates. Conductive thin films on flexible substrates are extensively
    used in flexible electronic devices and flexible semiconductors. Conductive thin
    films include any films deposited or bonded onto a non-conductive flexible substrate
    such as thin metal film, transparent conducting electrode, and thin silicon film.
    The electrical and mechanical behaviours of thin films on flexible substrates
    differ from those of freestanding films and substrates due to their interfacial
    interactions and adhesion between the film and substrate. The object of this standard
    is to establish simple and repeatable test methods for evaluating the electromechanical
    properties or flexibility of conductive thin films on flexible substrate. The
    bending test methods include outer bending test and inner bending test.
