- content: "ISO/IEC 24745:2011 provides guidance for the protection of biometric information
    under various requirements for confidentiality, integrity and renewability/revocability
    during storage and transfer. Additionally, ISO/IEC 24745:2011 provides requirements
    and guidelines for the secure and privacy-compliant management and processing
    of biometric information.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 24745:2011 specifies the following:<br
    />\r\n\tanalysis of the threats to and countermeasures inherent in a biometric
    and biometric system application models;<br />\r\n\tsecurity requirements for
    secure binding between a biometric reference and an identity reference;<br />\r\n\tbiometric
    system application models with different scenarios for the storage of biometric
    references and comparison; and<br />\r\n\tguidance on the protection of an individual's
    privacy during the processing of biometric information.<br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
