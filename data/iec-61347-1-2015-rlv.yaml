  content: "IEC 61347-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61347-1:2015 specifies
    general and safety requirements for lamp controlgear for use on d.c. supplies
    up to 250 V and/or a.c. supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2007, Amendment 1:2010 and
    Amendment 2:2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) additional marking requirements;<br />\r\nb) additional requirements
    for creepage distances and clearances:<br />\r\n- for working voltages with operating
    frequencies up to 30 kHz;<br />\r\n- for working voltages with higher operating
    frequencies than 30 kHz;<br />\r\n- for impulse and resonance voltages ignition;<br
    />\r\n- for basic, supplementary and reinforced insulation;<br />\r\n- for insulation
    between circuits;<br />\r\n- for coated or potted controlgear;<br />\r\nc) modification
    of definition of ELV and FELV;<br />\r\nd) modification of schematic drawing,
    showing the different controlgear classification and insulation requirements;<br
    />\r\ne) scope extension;<br />\r\nf) new Annex A: test to establish whether a
    conductive part is a live part which may cause an electric shock;<br />\r\ng)
    new Annex M: creepage distances and clearances for controlgear where a higher
    degree of availability (impulse withstand category III) may be requested;<br />\r\nh)
    new Annex Q: example for Up calculation;<br />\r\ni) new Annex P: creepage distances
    and clearances and distance through isolation (DTI) for lamp controlgear which
    are protected against pollution by the use of coating or potting;<br />\r\nj)
    new Annex R: concept of creepage distances and clearances."
