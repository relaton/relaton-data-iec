abstract:
- content: "IEC 60332-1-2:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60332-1-2:2025 edition 2.0 and the previous IIEC 60332-1-2:2004+AMD1:2015
    CSV edition 1.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 20 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60332‑1‑2:2025 specifies the procedure for testing
    the resistance to vertical flame propagation for a single vertical electrical
    insulated conductor or cable, or optical fibre cable, under fire conditions using
    a 1 kW pre-mixed flame. The apparatus is described in IEC 60332‑1‑1.<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 Testing to IEC 60332‑1‑2 can be performed simultaneously with that to IEC 60332‑1‑3,
    if required.<br />\r\nThis group safety publication focusing on test method(s)
    is primarily intended to be used as a product safety standard for the products
    mentioned in the scope, but is also intended to be used by technical committees
    in the preparation of standards for products similar to those mentioned in the
    scope of this group safety publication, in accordance with the principles laid
    down in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The performing of
    this test method on a single insulated conductor or cable or optical fibre cable
    does not provide compliance with fire propagation requirements in relevant standards
    in the case that the single insulated conductor or cable or optical fibre cable
    is installed with or amongst other cables as a group. (See the IEC 60332‑3 series).<br
    />\r\nOne of the responsibilities of a technical committee is, wherever applicable,
    to make use of basic safety publications and/or group safety publications in the
    preparation of its publications."
