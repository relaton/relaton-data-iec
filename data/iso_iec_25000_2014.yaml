    25000:2014 provides guidance for the use of the new series of International Standards

    of ISO/IEC 25000:2014 is to provide a general overview of SQuaRE contents, common
    reference models and definitions, as well as the relationship among the documents,
    allowing users of the Guide a good understanding of those series of standards,
    according to their purpose of use. It also contains an explanation of the transition
    process between the old ISO/IEC 9126 and the ISO/IEC 14598 series and SQuaRE."
