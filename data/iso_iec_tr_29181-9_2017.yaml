abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29189-9:2017 describes the general characteristics of Networking
    of Everything (NoE), which can be applied to Future Networks, especially from
    an Internet of Things (IoT) perspective. This document specifies:<br />\r\n- a
    conceptual model of NoE and its definition;<br />\r\n- problem statements in conventional
    networking;<br />\r\n- standardization activities of other standards-development
    organizations;<br />\r\n- requirements for NoE from an IoT perspective;<br />\r\n-
    technical aspects.<br />\r\nNOTE: Since networking issues are an integral part
    of IoT and Future Networks, while standards of IoT or Future Networks are under
    development in other standards-development organizations, this document focuses
    on networking issues to integrate diverse networking techniques to provide users'
    service and/or things requirement."
