abstract:
- content: "IEC 62031:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62031:2018
    specifies general and safety requirements for light-emitting diode (LED) modules:<br
    />\r\n- non-integrated LED modules (LEDni modules) and semi-integrated LED modules
    (LEDsi modules) for operation under constant voltage, constant current or constant
    power;<br />\r\n- Integrated LED modules (LEDi modules) for use on DC supplies
    up to 250 V or AC supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2008, Amendment 1:2012
    and Amendment 2:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na. the scope was clarified as well as the wording in
    several other clauses;<br />\r\nb. the normative references were updated;<br />\r\nc.
    the definitions for \"replaceable LED module\", \"non-replaceable LED module\"
    and \"non-user replaceable LED module\" were introduced while other definitions
    covered by IEC 62504 have been removed;<br />\r\nd. the marking clause was restructured
    and a table added to provide an informative overview;<br />\r\ne. the marking
    requirements for built-in LED modules were changed;<br />\r\nf. the entry for
    the marking with the working voltage was revised;<br />\r\ng. the provisions for
    terminals and heat management were revised;<br />\r\nh. Annex B was deleted;<br
    />\r\ni. information for luminaire design with regard to working voltage and water
    contact was introduced;<br />\r\nj. an abnormal temperature test was introduced."
