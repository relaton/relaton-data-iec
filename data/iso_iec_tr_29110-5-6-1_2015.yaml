abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29110:2015 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises,
    organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes
    described in the set of International Standards (IS) and Technical Reports (TR)
    are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than
    VSEs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29110:2015 provides the management and engineering guide
    to the Entry Profile described in ISO/IEC 29110-4-6 through Project Management
    and System Definition and realization processes. This part of ISO/IEC 29110 is
    a standalone guide; it is not intended for a VSE to use the standardized profile
    to implement ISO/IEC 29110:2015.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29110:2015 applies for non-critical
    systems development projects. The system development should fulfil the project
    requirements and the system description.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29110:2015, a VSE can
    obtain benefits in the following aspects:<br />\r\n– an agreed set of project
    requirements (technical part of contract) and expected products are agreed by
    the Acquirer;<br />\r\n– a disciplined management process, that provides project
    visibility and corrective actions of project problems and deviations, is performed;<br
    />\r\n– a systematic System Definition and Realization process, that satisfies
    Acquirer needs and ensures quality products, is followed.<br />\r\nVSEs developing
    software that is part of a larger system and for standalone software products
    and services are encouraged to use the management and engineering guide of the
    Entry Profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110‑5‑1‑1)."
