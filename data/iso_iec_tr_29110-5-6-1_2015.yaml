abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29110:2015 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs
    are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people.
    The lifecycle processes described in the set of International Standards (IS) and
    Technical Reports (TR) are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by
    organizations bigger than VSEs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29110:2015 provides the management
    and engineering guide to the Entry Profile described in ISO/IEC 29110-4-6 through
    Project Management and System Definition and realization processes. This part
    of ISO/IEC 29110 is a standalone guide; it is not intended for a VSE to use the
    standardized profile to implement ISO/IEC 29110:2015.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29110:2015
    applies for non-critical systems development projects. The system development
    should fulfil the project requirements and the system description.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    29110:2015, a VSE can obtain benefits in the following aspects:</p><p>– an agreed
    set of project requirements (technical part of contract) and expected products
    are agreed by the Acquirer;</p><p>– a disciplined management process, that provides
    project visibility and corrective actions of project problems and deviations,
    is performed;</p><p>– a systematic System Definition and Realization process,
    that satisfies Acquirer needs and ensures quality products, is followed.</p><p>VSEs
    developing software that is part of a larger system and for standalone software
    products and services are encouraged to use the management and engineering guide
    of the Entry Profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110‑5‑1‑1).</p>"
