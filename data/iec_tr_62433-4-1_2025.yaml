abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62433-4-1:2025 provides an overview of good practices to extract
    an ICIM-CI model from measurements and to build a numerical model of the PCB in
    which the ICIM-CI model is used to predict RF immunity of an IC in its application
    PCB.<br />\r\nThis document also discusses factors which can be considered to
    obtain proper results in an ICIM-CI model extraction and use of the actual model
    at the PCB level."
