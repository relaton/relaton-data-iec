  script: Latn
  content: IEC 62862-4-1:2022 specifies the general requirements for the design of
    solar power tower plants and covers the electric power system requirements, the
    solar resource assessment, the site selection, the overall planning, the layout
    of the heliostat field and the receiver tower, the layout of the power block,
    the collector system, the heat transfer, the thermal energy storage and steam
    generation system, the steam turbine system, the water treatment system, the information
    system, instrumentation and control, the electrical equipment and system, occupational
    safety and occupational health. This document is applicable to the design requirements
    of newly built, expanded or rebuilt solar power tower plants employing steam turbines
    with molten salt or water-steam as heat transfer fluid.
