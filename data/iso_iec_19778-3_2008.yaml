abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19778-3:2008 specifies the Data Model for a collaborative group.
    The collaborative group Data Model composes roles which can be played by the participants
    of a collaborative group, declares the intended role holders (positions for playing
    a particular role) for each role, and (at least during the life-span of the collaborative
    workplace) assigns participants to these role holders. The role names may be used
    as references to roles specified in detail by further specifications or standards.
    Where no such specifications or standards are available or identified, the provision
    of descriptions for human interpretation may support harmonized use of these names.
    Provided participant identifiers may be used as references to detailed participant
    information which may be specified in a provided user management system.</p>"
