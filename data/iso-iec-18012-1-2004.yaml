  content: Specifies requirements for product interoperability in the area of home
    and building automation systems, with sufficient detail needed to design interoperable
    Home Electronic System products. The widespread development of many national standard
    and proprietary networks within and to the home has necessitated a standard for
    interoperability among home system applications and products from multiple manufacturers.
    Where widely varying devices need to interoperate, it is desirable that they do
    so seamlessly to present a single, uniform network and hence to deliver a variety
    of applications. Examples of such applications are lighting control, environmental
    control, audio&#x2F;video equipment control and home security. Although a single
    uniform home control system would simplify operations, this standard recognises
    that multiple different networks may co-exist in the same house, and therefore
    applies to devices connected to a single home control system or to different home
    control systems. It ensures that, where applications on the same or dissimilar
    networks co-exist within premises and are required to interoperate, they will
    do so in a safe, reliable, predictable and consistent manner. It specifies requirements
    to assure that devices from multiple manufacturers work together to provide a
    specific application; a specific device could also be used for multiple applications.
    Interoperability requirements are given with respect to safety, addressing, applications,
    transport of information, management, and set-up of devices&#x2F;elements within
    home networks static and&#x2F;or dynamic binding between objects. This part defines
    the components of interoperability for the purpose of providing a framework within
    which subsequent parts of the standard will be drafted. This part applies to components
    within networks, between networks and located within dissimilar networks, as well
    as to devices located at the junction of dissimilar networks.
