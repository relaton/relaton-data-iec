abstract:
- content: This technical report provides guidance on best practice in the safe use
    of laser products that conform to IEC 60825-1. The terms "laser product" and "laser
    equipment" as used in this document also refer to any device, assembly or system,
    which is capable of emitting optical radiation produced by a process of stimulated
    emission. However, unlike IEC 60825-1, this document does not cover light-emitting
    diodes (LEDs). Class 1 laser products normally pose no hazard and Class 2 laser
    products present only a minimal hazard. With these products, it is normally sufficient
    to follow the warnings on the product labels and the manufacturer's instructions
    for safe use. Further protective measures as described in this document should
    not be necessary. This document emphasizes evaluation of the risk from higher
    power lasers, but the users of the lower power lasers may benefit from the information
    contained. This technical report can be applied to the use of any product that
    incorporates a laser, whether or not it is sold or offered for sale. Therefore,
    it applies to specially constructed lasers (including experimental and prototype
    systems). This technical report is intended to help laser users and their employers
    to understand the general principles of safety management (Clause 3), to identify
    the hazards that may be present (Clauses 4 to 6), to assess the risks of harm
    that may arise (Clause 7), and to set up and maintain appropriate control measures
    (Clauses 8 to 11). Reference is made in this document to laser "users". This should
    be taken to include persons having responsibility for safety in addition to those
    who actually work with or operate laser equipment.
