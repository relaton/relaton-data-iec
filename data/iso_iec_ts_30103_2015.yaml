abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 30103:2015 is to indicate how to apply the life cycle processes
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008 to achieve quality in the context of a specific product.
    It is independent of any tailoring that may be made to modify the generic process
    descriptions to suit the needs of a particular context. Even after any applicable
    tailoring, there is a need to apply the resulting process guidance and determine
    the specific detailed activities, tasks and associated success criteria for each
    of the process instances needed to deliver the target system. That is the focus
    of the framework described in ISO/TS 30103:2015.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 30103:2015
    is applicable to:<br />\r\n- those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008
    on projects dealing with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, software
    products, and services related to those systems and products, regardless of project
    scope, product(s), service(s), methodology, size or complexity,<br />\r\n- those
    who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 on projects dealing with man-made systems,
    software-intensive systems, software products, and services related to those systems
    and products, regardless of project scope, product(s), methodology, size or complexity,<br
    />\r\n- anyone performing technical processes and tasks,<br />\r\n- those who
    are responsible for the technical management of projects concerned with the development
    of systems,<br />\r\n- those responsible for performing ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2008
    life cycle processes at a project level,<br />\r\n- organizations and individuals
    subcontracting a project management effort,<br />\r\n- anyone developing systems
    engineering management documentation to complete technical planning aspects of
    their project processes,<br />\r\n- anyone performing systems engineering activities,<br
    />\r\n- project managers responsible for staffing projects and identifying competency
    development needs,<br />\r\n- anyone developing information items during the application
    of project and technical processes, and<br />\r\n- anyone performing project and
    technical processes to aid in ensuring that the information items developed during
    these processes conform to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289."
