    <p>This document, within the context of methods and tools for supporting the diagnosis of the organization's capability to adopt or improve software and systems product line engineering<b>:</b></p>
    <p>—     defines processes for product line technical probe; those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;</p>
    <p>—     defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process; and</p>
    <p>—     defines tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.</p>
    <p>This document does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.</p>
