abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    40314:2016 defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML.<br />\r\nMathML
    is a markup language for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its
    structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served,
    received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality
    for text.<br />\r\nMathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and
    mathematical content. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation
    elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact
    with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of special characters
    used for mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and
    their relation to fonts.<br />\r\nMathML was originally specified as an XML application
    and most of the examples in this specification assume that syntax. Unless explictly
    noted, the examples in this specification are also valid HTML syntax."
