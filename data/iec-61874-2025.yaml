  content: "<p>IEC 61874:2025 applies to equipment consisting of:<br />\r\n- a borehole
    logging probe equipped with a collimated radioisotope (gamma) source (during the
    actual measurements only) and a detector unit to measure scattered gamma radiation;<br
    />\r\n- a hoisting system and depth measuring system;<br />\r\n- other instruments
    and devices (power supply, pulse converter/amplifier, ratemeter, recorder, signal
    processing and readout units).<br />\r\nThis document defines the terminology,
    specifies the types of apparatus, design and general technical requirements, specific
    radiation performance, electrical, mechanical, safe and environmental performance
    requirements. It also defines test and calibration procedures and covers electrical
    safety and radiation protection issues. Further, it gives recommendations about
    items included in the manufacturer's operation and maintenance documentation (or
    certificate).<br />\r\nThe purpose of this document is to specify design requirements
    and performance characteristics of nuclear instrumentation used in boreholes to
    determine bulk rock density in situ. With suitable response charts the measurements
    can be equated to rock lithology and porosity.</p>"
