  content: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a defining force of the 21st century,
    reshaping industries, economies, and daily life. From personalized healthcare
    to autonomous systems and intelligent infrastructure, AI’s relevance today is
    both pervasive and profound. AI-generated content (AIGC) – once a secondary focus
    – has re-emerged as a pivotal area of focus with vast creative and commercial
    potential.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC technology and market outlook paper (TMOP)
    offers a timely and strategic examination of AIGC’s trajectory, and its evolution
    from the 1950s to the present. Mentioning key breakthroughs such as ChatGPT and
    DeepSeek-R1, the paper highlights that recent innovations mark tremendous leaps
    in multimodal interaction, content generation, and reasoning efficiency – laying
    the groundwork for future exploration of artificial general intelligence (AGI).<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nThe paper offers an overview of the AIGC model architecture, training
    and fine-tuning techniques, and its potential for industry applications. The paper
    highlights AIGC’s expanding role across sectors including smart cities, intelligent
    manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, and embodied intelligence. It also addresses
    critical challenges: data quality and compliance, infrastructure demands, energy
    consumption, and ethical and regulatory oversight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy systematically
    examining these aspects, the paper offers valuable insights and strategic recommendations
    to investors, policymakers, industry leaders, and technology developers.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis TMOP has been prepared by the IEC AIGC project team, comprising members
    from a variety of organizations, universities, research institutes and industry
    associations, working under the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis TMOP is available for
    <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/artificial-intelligence-generated-content-aigc-industry-insights-and-exploring-future\">free
    download</a>."
