  content: IEC TS 61724-2:2016(E) defines a procedure for measuring and analyzing
    the power production of a specific photovoltaic system with the goal of evaluating
    the quality of the PV system performance. The test is intended to be applied during
    a relatively short time period (a few relatively sunny days). The intent of this
    document is to specify a framework procedure for comparing the measured power
    produced against the expected power from a PV system on relatively sunny days.
