abstract:
- content: "IEC 60034-5:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60034-5:2020
    applies to the classification of degrees of protection provided by enclosures
    for rotating electrical machines. It defines the requirements for protective enclosures
    that are in all other respects suitable for their intended use and which, from
    the point of view of materials and workmanship, ensure that the properties dealt
    with in this document are maintained under normal conditions of use. This document
    does not specify degrees of protection against mechanical damage of the machine,
    or conditions such as moisture (produced for example by condensation), corrosive
    dust and vapour, fungus or vermin.<br />\r\nThis document is also applicable to
    explosion proof machines, but it does not specify the types of protection for
    use in a potentially explosive (dust, gas) environment. Those are defined in the
    IEC 60079 series of standards. This document gives definitions for standard degrees
    of protection provided by enclosures applicable to rotating electrical machines
    as regards the:<br />\r\na. protection of persons against contacts with or approach
    to live parts and against contact with moving parts (other than smooth rotating
    shafts and the like) inside the enclosure and protection of the machine against
    ingress of solid foreign objects<br />\r\nb. protection of machines against the
    harmful effects due to ingress of water;<br />\r\nc. protection of machines against
    the harmful effects due to ingress of dust.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels
    and replaces the fourth edition, published in 2000, and its Amendment 1:2006.The
    main technical changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n- the
    inclusion of an additional second numeral 9 including its test method,<br />\r\n-
    an additional note for clarification in Table 3,<br />\r\n- a clarification on
    the term open drain hole,<br />\r\n- a clarification on the ingress of dust in
    Table 4,<br />\r\n- pressure values given now in Pa only,<br />\r\n- a clarification
    in the scope on the applicability of this standard for (Ex) motors,<br />\r\n-
    a new Clause 3 with definitions,"
