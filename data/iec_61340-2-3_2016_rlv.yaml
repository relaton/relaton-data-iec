abstract:
- content: "IEC 61340-2-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61340-2-3:2016 describes
    test methods for the determination of the electrical resistance and resistivity
    of solid materials used to avoid electrostatic charge accumulation, in which the
    measured resistance is in the range 10K Ohm to 1T Ohm. It takes account of existing
    IEC/ISO standards and other published information, and gives recommendations and
    guidelines on the appropriate method. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) a distinction
    has been introduced between instrumentation used for laboratory evaluations, instrumentation
    used for acceptance testing and instrumentation used for compliance verification
    (periodic testing);<br />\r\nb) an alternative electrode assembly is described,
    which can be used on non-planar products or when the dimensions of the product
    under test are too small to allow the larger electrode assembly to be used;<br
    />\r\nc) the formulae for calculating surface and volume resistivity have been
    modified to correspond with common industry practice in the main areas of application
    for the IEC 61340 series.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of July 2023
    have been included in this copy."
