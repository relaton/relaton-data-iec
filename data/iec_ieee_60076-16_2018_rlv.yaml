abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 60076-16:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 60076-16:2018
    applies to dry-type and liquid-immersed transformers for wind turbine step-up
    application having a winding with highest voltage for equipment up to and including
    72,5 kV. This document applies to the transformer used to connect the wind turbine
    generator to the wind farm power collection system or adjacent distribution network
    and not the transformer used to connect several wind turbines to a distribution
    or transmission network. Transformers covered by this document comply with the
    relevant requirements prescribed in the IEC 60076 standards or IEEE C57 standards.
    This second edition of IEC/IEEE 60076-16 cancels and replaces IEC 60076-16:2011,
    and constitutes a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous
    edition are as follows:<br />\r\n1) relationship between transformer rated power
    and the output current from the associated generator is introduced;<br />\r\n2)
    thermal correction of the effective cooling medium has been introduced;<br />\r\n3)
    testing regime has been strengthened to ensure transformers are suitable for the
    harsh electrical environment to which they are subjected.<br />\r\nKeywords: transformers
    for wind turbine applications"
