  content: "IEC 60793-1-47:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC
    60793-1-47:2017 establishes uniform requirements for measuring the macrobending
    loss of single-mode fibres (class B) at 1 550 nm or 1 625 nm, category A1 multimode
    fibres at 850 nm or 1 300 nm, and category A3 and A4 multimode fibres at 650 nm,
    850 nm or 1 300 nm, thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables for
    commercial purposes. This document gives two methods for measuring macrobending
    sensitivity:<br />\r\n- Method A – Fibre winding, pertains to class B single-mode
    fibres and category A1 multimode fibres.<br />\r\n- Method B – Quarter circle
    bends, pertains to category A3 and A4 multimode fibres.<br />\r\nFor both of these
    methods, the macrobending loss can be measured utilizing general fibre attenuation
    techniques, for example the power monitoring technique (see Annex A) or the cut‑back
    technique (see Annex B). Methods A and B are expected to produce different results
    if they are applied to the same fibre. This is because the key difference between
    the two methods is the deployment, including the bend radius and length of fibre
    that is bent. The reason for the difference is that A3 and A4 multimode fibres
    are expected to be deployed in short lengths with a smaller number of bends per
    unit fiber length compared to single-mode and category A1 multimode fibres. In
    this document, the \"curvature radius\" is defined as the radius of the suitable
    circular shaped support (e.g. mandrel or guiding groove on a flat surface) on
    which the fibre can be bent. In addition, informative Annex E has been added to
    approximate bend loss for class B single-mode fibres across a broad wavelength
    range at various effective bends. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the
    third edition published in 2009. It constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- former Annex A has been renumbered to Annex D;<br />\r\n-
    introduction of new Annex A on the transmitted power monitoring technique;<br
    />\r\n- introduction of Annex B on the cut-back technique;<br />\r\n- introduction
    of Annex C on the requirements for the optical source characteristics of A1 multimode
    measurement;<br />\r\n- introduction of Annex E on parallel plate (2-point) macrobend
    loss approximation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: macrobending loss of single-mode
    fibers"
