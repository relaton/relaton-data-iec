abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-16-1:2011 defines an architecture that will address the issue of reporting
    and tracking power states of nodes in a network. The UPnP Low Power solution is
    designed to enable nodes in the network to report and track the Low Power states
    of other nodes in the network. Additionally, for nodes that support wake up capabilities,
    this architecture addresses methods to wake up those nodes when required. The
    objective of the UPnP Low Power solution is to allow UPnP devices to conserve
    energy and still be discoverable by UPnP Control Points. The UPnP Control Point
    will be aware of the UPnP devices and services implemented on a Low Power device
    even when the Low Power device is in a power savings mode. This architecture document
    defines two UPnP services that comprise the UPnP Low Power framework: Low Power
    device service and Basic Power Management Proxy service."
