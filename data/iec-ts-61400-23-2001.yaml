    Is a technical specification providing guidelines for the full-scale structural testing of wind turbine blades and for the interpretation or evaluation of results, as a possible part of a design verification of the integrity of the blade. Includes static strength tests, fatigue tests, and other tests determining blade properties.
    <br /><br />This publication is of high relevance for Smart Grid</a>.
