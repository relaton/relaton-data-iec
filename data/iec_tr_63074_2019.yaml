abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63074:2019 gives guidance on the use of IEC 62443 (all parts) related
    to those aspects of security threats and vulnerabilities that could influence
    functional safety implemented and realized by safety-related control systems (SCS)
    and could lead to the loss of the ability to maintain safe operation of a machine.<br
    />\r\nConsidered security aspects of the machine with potential relation to SCS
    are:<br />\r\n– vulnerabilities of the SCS either directly or indirectly through
    the other parts of the machine which can be exploited by security threats that
    can result in security attacks (security breach);<br />\r\n– influence on the
    safety characteristics and ability of the SCS to properly perform its function(s);<br
    />\r\n– typical use case definition and application of a corresponding threat
    model."
