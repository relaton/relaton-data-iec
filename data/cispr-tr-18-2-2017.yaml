  content: "<!-- NEW -->CISPR TR 18-2:2017 which is a Technical Report, applies to
    radio noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment which may cause
    interference to radio reception. The frequency range covered by this publication
    is 0,15 MHz to 3 GHz. A general procedure for establishing the limits of the radio
    noise field from the power lines and equipment is recommended, together with typical
    values as examples, and methods of measurement. The clause on limits concentrates
    on the low frequency and medium frequency bands and it is only in these bands
    where ample evidence, based on established practice, is available. No examples
    of limits to protect radio reception in the frequency band 30 MHz to 3 GHz have
    been given, as measuring methods and certain other aspects of the problems in
    this band have not yet been fully resolved. Site measurements and service experience
    have shown that levels of noise from power lines at frequencies higher than 300
    MHz in normal operation are so low that interference is unlikely to be caused
    to television reception. The values of limits given as examples are calculated
    to provide a reasonable degree of protection to the reception of broadcasting
    at the boundary of the recognized service areas of the appropriate transmitters
    in the radio frequency bands used for a.m. radio broadcasting, in the least favourable
    conditions likely to be generally encountered. These limits are intended to provide
    guidance at the planning stage of the line and national standards or other specifications
    against which the performance of the line may be checked after construction and
    during its useful life. The measuring apparatus and methods used for checking
    compliance with limits should comply with the respective CISPR specifications,
    as e.g. the basic standards series CISPR 16, see [1]. This third edition of CISPR
    TR 18-2 is adapted to the modern structure and content of technical reports issued
    by IEC. The second edition of CISPR TR 18-2 underwent thorough edition and adaptation
    to modern terminology. This third edition now also covers an adequate method of
    measurement for radiated disturbances from HV overhead power lines and substations
    in the range 300 MHz to 3 GHz, since gap-type discharges can be a potential noise
    source disturbing modern digital radio communication.<br />\r\nKeywords: radio
    noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment"
