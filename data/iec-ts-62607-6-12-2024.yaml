  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-12:2024 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristic<br />\r\n- number of layers<br />\r\nfor films
    consisting of graphene by<br />\r\n- Raman spectroscopy and<br />\r\n- optical
    reflection.<br />\r\nCriteria for the determination of the number of layers are
    the G-peak integrated intensity and the optical contrast. Both methods enable
    to distinguish between graphene and multilayer graphene. However, neither method
    on its own nor the combination of the two enable a determination of the number
    of layers in all possible cases (especially regarding all possible stacking angles).
    But the comparison of the values deduced by each method allows to discriminate
    whether the determined number of layers is correct and can be specified or not.<br
    />\r\n- The method is applicable to exfoliated graphene and graphene grown on
    or transferred to a substrate with a small defect density, low surface contamination
    (e.g. transfer residue) and number of layers up to 5.<br />\r\n- The method is
    suitable for the following substrates:<br />\r\na) glass (soda lime glass or similar
    with a refractive index between 1,45 and 1,55 at 532 nm);<br />\r\nb) oxidized
    silicon (SiO2 on silicon, with a SiO2 thickness of 90 nm ± 5 nm).<br />\r\n- The
    spatial resolution is in the order of 1 µm given by the spot size of the exciting
    laser."
