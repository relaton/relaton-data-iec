  content: "IEC 61108-7:2024 specifies the minimum performance standards, methods
    of testing and required test results for Satellite based augmentation system (SBAS)
    shipborne receiver equipment, which uses L1 signals from GPS and satellite based
    augmentation system (SBAS) in order to improve the estimated GPS position.<br
    />\r\nThis document addresses the use of SBAS L1 to provide augmentation to the
    GPS shipborne receiver (IMO Resolution MSC.112(73)). This document includes the
    minimum performances for SBAS L1 maritime receivers to be obtained by the receiver
    equipment under coverage of SBAS service in order to be compliant with the IMO
    Resolution A.1046(27) describing operational requirements for ocean waters, harbour
    entrances, harbour approaches and coastal waters."
