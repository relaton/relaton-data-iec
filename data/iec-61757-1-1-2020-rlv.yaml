  content: "IEC 61757-1-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61757-1-1:2020 defines
    detail specifications for fibre optic sensors using one or more fibre Bragg gratings
    (FBG) as the sensitive element for strain measurements. Generic specifications
    for fibre optic sensors are defined in IEC 61757. This document specifies the
    most important features and characteristics of a fibre optic sensor for strain
    measurements, based on use of an FBG as the sensitive element, and defines the
    procedures for their determination. Furthermore, it specifies basic performance
    parameters and characteristics of the corresponding measuring instrument to read
    out the optical signal from the FBG. This document refers to the measurement of
    static and dynamic strain values in a range of frequencies. A blank detail specification
    is provided in Annex B. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- update of cited standards;<br />\r\n- clarification of definitions and
    test specifications.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
