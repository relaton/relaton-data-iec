  content: Deals with the safety of electric heat pumps, including sanitary hot water
    heat pumps, air-conditioners, and dehumidifiers incorporating sealed motor-compressors.
    The maximum rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single phase and 600 V
    for all other appliances. The referenced appliances may consist of one or more
    assemblies. If provided in more than one assembly, the assemblies are to used
    together, and the requirements are based on the use of matched assemblies. Supplementary
    heaters, or a provision for their seperate installation, are within the scope
    of this standard, but only heaters which are designed as a part of the appliance
    package, the controls being incorporated in the appliance. This consolidated version
    consists of the fourth edition (2002), its amendment 1 (2005) and its amendment
    2 (2005). Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.
