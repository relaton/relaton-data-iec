    common FDT principles are implemented based on the Microsoft COM technology, including
    the object behavior and object interaction via COM interfaces. This part specifies
    the technology-specific implementation of the protocol-specific functionality
    and communication services. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2009, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- correction of specification for bus master configuration;<br
    />\r\n- correction of specification for propagation of changes;<br />\r\n- correction
    of description of DTM services for online operation."
