- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TS 62600-103:2024 is available as IEC TS 62600-103:2024
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.IEC TS 62600-103:2024
    is concerned with the sub-prototype scale development of wave energy converters
    (WECs). It includes wave tank test programmes, where wave conditions are controlled
    so they can be scheduled, and first sea trials, where sea states occur naturally
    and the programmes are adjusted and flexible to accommodate the conditions. Commercial-scale
    prototype tests are not covered in this document.<br />\r\nThis document addresses:<br
    />\r\n- Planning an experimental programme, including a design statement, technical
    drawings, facility selection, site data and other inputs as specified in Clause
    5.<br />\r\n- Device characterisation, including the physical device model, PTO
    components and mooring arrangements where appropriate.<br />\r\n- Environment
    characterisation, concerning either the tank testing facility or the sea deployment
    site, depending on the stage of development.<br />\r\n- Specification of specific
    test goals, including power conversion performance, device motions, device loads
    and device survival.<br />\r\nThis document prescribes the minimum test programmes
    that form the basis of a structured technology development schedule. For each
    testing campaign, the prerequisites, goals and minimum test plans are specified.
    This document serves a wide audience of wave energy stakeholders, including device
    developers and their technical advisors; government agencies and funding councils;
    test centres and certification bodies; private investors; and environmental regulators
    and NGOs."
