  content: "IEC/IEEE 65700-19-03:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC/IEEE 65700-19-03:2025
    applies to outdoor and indoor bushings of any voltage used on DC systems, of capacitance
    graded or gas insulated types for use as components of liquid-filled converter
    transformers and smoothing reactors, as well as air-to-air DC bushings. It applies
    to both line commutated converter (LCC), as well as voltage source converter (VSC)
    technologies. This document does not apply to the following:<br />\r\n- cable
    terminations (potheads);<br />\r\n- bushings for instrument transformers;<br />\r\n-
    bushings for test power supplies;<br />\r\n- bushings applied with gaseous insulation
    (other than air at atmospheric pressure) external to the bushing;<br />\r\n- bushings
    for industrial application;<br />\r\n- bushings for traction application;<br />\r\n-
    bushings for distribution class transformers.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision and includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- service experiences as well as established
    market requirements have been harmonized with existing IEC and IEEE standards,
    primarily IEC 60137, Insulated bushings for alternating voltages above 1 000 V,
    and IEEE Std C57.19.00™, IEEE Standard General Requirements and Test Procedures
    for Outdoor Power Apparatus Bushings;<br />\r\n- inclusion of voltage source converter
    (VSC) technologies.</p>"
