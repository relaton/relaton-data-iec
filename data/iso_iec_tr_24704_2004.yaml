abstract:
- content: Describes the use of generic cabling for customer premises, as specified
    in international standard ISO/IEC 11801, for connection to wireless access points.
    The customer premises may encompass one or more buildings or may be within a building
    that contains more than one enterprise. This TR, intended to guide new installations
    and renovations, specifies an ISO/IEC compliant implementation methodology that
    enables connection to information and communications technology (ICT) equipment
    that is specifically deployed to provide a grid of wireless coverage areas within
    buildings. The cabling may be installed prior to the selection of specific equipment
    or the wireless application to be used. This TR was created because the infrastructure
    specified in cabling standard ISO/IEC 11801 does not specifically cover infrastructure
    for connections to wireless access points. Supplementary information is provided
    here on the number of outlets and outlet placement for wireless access points
    that may optionally receive both power and information transfer through the IT
    cabling.
