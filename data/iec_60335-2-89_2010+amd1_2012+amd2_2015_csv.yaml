abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-89:2010+A1:2012+A2:2015 specifies safety requirements for
    electrically operated commercial refrigerating appliances that have an incorporated
    compressor or that are supplied in two units for assembly as a single appliance
    in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions (split system). Appliances
    that are within the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n- refrigerated display
    and storage cabinets;<br />\r\n- refrigerated trolley cabinets;<br />\r\n- service
    counters and self-service counters;<br />\r\n- blast chillers and blast freezers.
    The principal changes in the edition with respect to the first edition are as
    follows:<br />\r\n- aligns the text with IEC 60335-1 and its Amendments 1 and
    2;<br />\r\n- introduces requirements for appliances using transcritical refrigerant
    systems;<br />\r\n- introduces an enhanced flexing test. The attention of National
    Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations
    may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselfs for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of
    publication.<br />\r\nThe contents of the interpretation sheet of July 2014 have
    been included in this copy.<br /><br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read
    in conjunction with IEC 60335-1:2010.<strong>This consolidated version consists
    of the second edition (2006), its amendment 1 (2012) and its amendment 2 (2015).
    Therefore, no need to order amendments in addition to this publication.</strong><br
    /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60335-1:2010."
