  content: "IEC TR 63396:2021(E) documents a method for the sound pressure level measurement
    on power capacitor units, by which the sound power level of power capacitor units
    is determined.<br />\r\nThis method is applicable to shunt capacitor units and
    AC filter capacitor units for AC power systems with a nominal voltage of 1 kV
    and above and a frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nThis method also applies
    to the DC filter capacitor units.<br />\r\nOther measurements on power capacitor
    units can be implemented with reference to this method."
