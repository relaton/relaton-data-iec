abstract:
- content: Power semiconductors are electronic components which are key enablers to
    tackling major challenges of decarbonization and digitization on the path to an
    energy-wise society.<br /><br />This IEC White Paper establishes the critical
    role that power semiconductors play in various aspects of modern industry and
    in society – from renewable power generation and transmission, electromobility,
    automated factories, energy-efficient data centres to smart cities and smart homes.
    It covers the various expected trends, opportunities and challenges surrounding
    the power semiconductors industry. Significant challenges are mentioned such as
    the need for change in industry practices when transitioning from linear to circular
    economies, and shortage of skilled personnel required for power semiconductor
    development.<br /><br />The white paper stresses the need for strategic actions
    at the policy-making level to address these concerns and calls for stronger government
    commitment, policies, and funding to advance power semiconductor technologies
    and integration. It demands recognition of the crucial role played by power semiconductors
    in global decarbonization efforts.<br /><br />It further highlights the pivotal
    role of standards in removing significant technical risks, increasing product
    quality and enabling faster market acceptance. According to the authors, IEC can
    play a leading role in promoting collaboration among stakeholders, aligning methodologies,
    and ensuring that international and national standardization bodies work closely
    with industry. Additionally, the white paper delivers recommendations to IEC stakeholders
    for collaborative structures and accelerating the development and adoption of
    standards.<br /><br />In a first for the IEC Market Strategy Board’s White Paper
    series, the authors aim to inspire the engagement of young professionals in the
    area.<br /><br />This white paper has been prepared by a project team representing
    a variety of organizations, working under the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB).
    The project team included representatives from semiconductor network businesses,
    academia, equipment vendors from around the world, and IEC Young Professionals.
    Dr Kazuhiko Tsutsumi, Mitsubishi Electric Corporation and MSB Chair, served as
    the project sponsor. Dr Munaf Rahimo and Dr Iulian Nistor of MTAL GmbH served
    as coordinating authors and project partner.<br /><br />This IEC White Paper is
    available for free download.
