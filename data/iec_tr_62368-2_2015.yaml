abstract:
- content: 'IEC/TR 62368-2:2015(E) provides explanatory information related to IEC
    62368-1. Only those subclauses considered to need further background reference
    information or explanation of their content to benefit the reader are included.
    Therefore, not all numbered subclauses are cited. Unless otherwise noted, all
    references are to clauses, subclauses, annexes, figures or tables located in IEC
    62368-1:2014. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2011. It constitutes a technical revision. This second edition updates the
    first edition of IEC 62368-2 published in 2011 to take into account changes made
    to IEC 62368-1:2010 as identified in the Forword of IEC 62368-1:2014. This Technical
    Report is informative only. In case of a conflict between IEC 62368-1 and IEC
    TR 62368-2, the requirements in IEC 62368-1 prevail over this Technical Report.
    Key words: Audio/Video, Safeguards, Information, Communication'
