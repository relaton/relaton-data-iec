abstract:
- content: The scope of the DPCS standard is to make it possible for integrated circuit
    designers to analyze chip timing and power consistently across a broad set of
    EDA applications, for integrated circuit vendors to express timing and power information
    once (for a given technology), and for EDA vendors to meet their application performance
    and capacity needs.
