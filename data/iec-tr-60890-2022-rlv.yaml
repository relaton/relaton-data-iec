  content: "IEC TR 60890:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 60890:2022
    specifies a method of air temperature-rise calculation inside enclosures for low-voltage
    switchgear and controlgear assemblies or similar products in accordance with their
    respective standard. The method is primarily applicable to enclosed assemblies
    or partitioned sections of assemblies without forced ventilation. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- alignment with IEC 61439-1:2020;<br
    />\r\n- addition of individual annexes for guidance of technical explanations
    related to:<br />\r\n--- effect of an uneven power distribution;<br />\r\n---
    additional temperature-rise due to solar radiation;<br />\r\n--- effect of different
    enclosure materials;<br />\r\n--- effect of different natural ventilation management;<br
    />\r\n--- forced ventilation management;<br />\r\n--- power losses calculation;<br
    />\r\n--- impact of an adjacent wall can have on the assembly cooling surface(s);<br
    />\r\n- maximum internal ambient temperature limit into an assembly;<br />\r\n-
    validity area of the calculation extended from 3 150 A to 3 200 A;<br />\r\n-
    addition of an algebraic equation to the different curves included in the document."
