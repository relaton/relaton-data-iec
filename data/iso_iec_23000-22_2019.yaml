abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the Multi-Image Application Format (MIAF), which
    contains coded images, groups and sequences of images along with their metadata
    and the information about their relations to each other, all embedded in the High
    Efficiency Image File (HEIF) format.<br />\r\nThis document builds on the HEIF
    specification and defines the following:<br />\r\n— a set of additional constraints
    on ISO/IEC 23008-12 (HEIF) specification, to simplify its file format options;<br
    />\r\n— specific alpha plane formats;<br />\r\n— a set of specific profiles and
    levels for the supported coding formats;<br />\r\n— a set of specific metadata
    formats;<br />\r\n— a set of brands, including application brands indicating conformance
    with specific profiles;<br />\r\n— a set of rules for extending MIAF format to
    support additional coding formats, profiles, levels and metadata.<br />\r\nThis
    document also defines the normative behaviour for a MIAF reader and MIAF renderer.<br
    />\r\nThe MIAF specification is intentionally written to be extensible, and to
    allow for forward compatibility. The format is also permissive of the presence
    of other data, such as coding formats, metadata, and derived images."
