    <p>ISO/IEC 19795-2:2007 addresses two specific biometric performance testing methodologies: technology and scenario evaluation. The large majority of biometric tests are of one of these two generic evaluation types. Technology evaluations evaluate enrolment and comparison algorithms by means of previously collected corpuses, while scenario evaluations evaluate sensors and algorithms by processing of samples collected from Test Subjects in real time. The former is intended for generation of large volumes of comparison scores and candidate lists indicative of the fundamental discriminating power of an algorithm. The latter is intended for measurement of performance in modeled environments, inclusive of Test Subject-system interactions.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19795-2:2007 provides requirements and recommendations on data collection, analysis and reporting specific to the two primary types of evaluation: technology evaluation and scenario evaluation.</p>
    <p>It specifies requirements in the following areas:</p>
    <ul><li>development and full description of protocols for technology and scenario evaluations;</li><li>execution and reporting of biometric evaluations reflective of the parameters associated with biometric evaluation types.</li></ul>
