  content: "IEC 61347-2-3:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61347-2-3:2024
    specifies safety requirements for electronic controlgear for use on AC supplies
    at 50 Hz or 60 Hz up to 1 000 V or on DC supplies up to 1 000 V with lamp operating
    frequencies deviating from the supply frequency, associated with fluorescent lamps
    as specified in IEC 60081 and IEC 60901, low-pressure UV lamps, and other fluorescent
    lamps for high-frequency operation. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2011 and Amendment 1:2016. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) introduction
    of dated references where appropriate;<br />\r\nb) clarification of sample item
    numbers;<br />\r\nc) alignment of clause numbers with those of IEC 61347-1."
