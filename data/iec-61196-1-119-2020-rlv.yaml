  content: "IEC 61196-1-119:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61196-1-119:2020
    defines the requirements to determine the average power handling capability of
    a coaxial cable at specified frequencies at ambient temperatures. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2012. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- title was changed from: RF power rating to: RF average power
    rating;<br />\r\n- a test method to determine sufficient duration is included
    as annex<br />\r\n- the equations used for calculating cable coefficients and
    RF average power rating are corrected;<br />\r\n- the clauses and subclauses are
    rearranged.</p>"
