  content: "IEC TS 62282-7-1:2017(E) covers cell assemblies, test station setup, measuring
    instruments and measuring methods, performance test methods, and test reports
    for PEFC single cells. This document is used for evaluating:<br />\r\n- the performance
    of membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) for PEFCs in a single cell configuration;<br
    />\r\n- materials or structures of PEFCs in a single cell configuration;or<br
    />\r\n- the influence of impurities in fuel and/or in air on the fuel cell performance."
