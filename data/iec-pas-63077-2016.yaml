  content: IEC PAS 63077:2016(E) describes and defines the process of refurbishment
    of used medical imaging equipment and applies to the restoring of used medical
    imaging equipment to a condition of safety and effectiveness comparable to that
    of new equipment. This restoration includes actions such as repair, rework, software/hardware
    updates, and the replacement of worn parts with original parts. This document
    enumerates the actions that must be performed and the manner consistent with product
    specifications and service procedures required to ensure that the refurbishment
    of medical imaging equipment is done without changing the finished medical imaging
    equipment's performance, safety specifications, or intended use according to its
    original or applicable valid registration.
