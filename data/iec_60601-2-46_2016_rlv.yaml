abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-2-46:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-46:2016 specifies
    safety requirements for operating tables, whether or not having electrical parts,
    including transporters, used for the transportation of the operating table top
    to or from the base or pedestal of an operating table with detachable operating
    table top. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2010 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition of IEC 60601-2-46 was
    revised to align structurally with the 2005 edition of IEC 60601-1 and with IEC
    60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012."
