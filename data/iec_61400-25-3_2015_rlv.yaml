abstract:
- content: "IEC 61400-25-3:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61400-25-3:2015 specifies
    an abstract communication service interface describing the information exchange
    between a client and a server for:<br />\r\n- data access and retrieval,<br />\r\n-
    device control,<br />\r\n- event reporting and logging,<br />\r\n- self-description
    of devices (device data dictionary),<br />\r\n- data typing and discovery of data
    types.<br />\r\nMain changes with respect to the previous edition consist of:<br
    />\r\n- harmonization with newer editions of IEC 61850 standards;<br />\r\n- reduction
    of overlap between standards and simplification by increased referencing, etc."
