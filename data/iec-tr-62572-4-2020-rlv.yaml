  content: "IEC TR 62572-4:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC/TR 62572-4:2020,
    which is a Technical Report, provides guidelines for optical connector end-face
    cleaning methods for receptacle style optical transceivers. It includes details
    about handling receptacle style optical transceivers, internal structures of optical
    transceivers, information on cleaning tools and machines, applicable cleaning
    methods, and cleaning procedures. Receptacle style optical transceivers as well
    as optical fibre patch cords are handled by operators and maintenance staff of
    optical network systems. This document can be used as a guideline to prepare instruction
    manuals for the operators and maintenance staff of optical network systems. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2013. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    addition of terms and definitions on multifibre connector interface optical transceivers;<br
    />\r\n- addition of cleaning methods for multifibre connector interface type optical
    transceivers;<br />\r\n- updating URLs for reference websites."
