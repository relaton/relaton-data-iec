abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a set of Packed Encoding Rules that may be
    used to derive a transfer syntax for values of types defined in Rec. ITU-T X.680
    | ISO/IEC 8824-1. These Packed Encoding Rules are also to be applied for decoding
    such a transfer syntax in order to identify the data values being transferred.</p><p>The
    encoding rules specified in this document:</p><p>– are used at the time of communication;</p><p>–
    are intended for use in circumstances where minimizing the size of the representation
    of values is the major concern in the choice of encoding rules;</p><p>– allow
    the extension of an abstract syntax by addition of extra values, preserving the
    encodings of the existing values, for all forms of extension described in Rec.
    ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824‑1;</p><p>– can be modified in accordance with the provisions
    of Rec. ITU-T X.695 | ISO/IEC 8825‑6.</p>"
