abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document specifies a set of
    Packed Encoding Rules that may be used to derive a transfer syntax for values
    of types defined in Rec. ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1. These Packed Encoding Rules
    are also to be applied for decoding such a transfer syntax in order to identify
    the data values being transferred.</p><p>The encoding rules specified in this
    document:</p><p>– are used at the time of communication;</p><p>– are intended
    for use in circumstances where minimizing the size of the representation of values
    is the major concern in the choice of encoding rules;</p><p>– allow the extension
    of an abstract syntax by addition of extra values, preserving the encodings of
    the existing values, for all forms of extension described in Rec. ITU-T X.680
    | ISO/IEC 8824‑1;</p><p>– can be modified in accordance with the provisions of
    Rec. ITU-T X.695 | ISO/IEC 8825‑6.</p>
