  content: "IEC 60384-22:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60384-22:2019
    is applicable to fixed unencapsulated surface mount multilayer capacitors of ceramic
    dielectric, Class 2, for use in electronic equipment. These capacitors have metallized
    connecting pads or soldering strips and are intended to be mounted on printed
    boards, or directly onto substrates for hybrid circuits. Capacitors for electromagnetic
    interference suppression are not included, but are covered by IEC 60384-14. The
    object of this document is to prescribe preferred ratings and characteristics
    and to select from IEC 60384-1 the appropriate quality assessment procedures,
    tests and measuring methods and to give general performance requirements for this
    type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements prescribed in detail specifications
    referring to this sectional specification are of equal or higher performance levels,
    lower performance levels are not permitted. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    revision of the structure in accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2016 (seventh
    edition) to the extent practicable, and for harmonizing with IEC 60384-21;<br
    />\r\n- deletion of the description on the permissible reactive power in 6.2.2
    because it is not appropriate for the purposes of this document;<br />\r\n- the
    dimensions of 0201M in Annex A have been added.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
