  content: "IEC TS 62257-9-5:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62257-9-5:2016(E)
    applies to stand-alone rechargeable electric lighting appliances or kits that
    can be installed by a typical user without employing a technician. It presents
    a quality assurance framework that includes product specifications, test methods,
    and standardized specification sheets. This new edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    battery test methods updated to harmonize with existing IEC standards, sequence
    of testing changed to allow the battery to be charged using the product's charge
    controller prior to the full-battery run time test;<br />\r\n- limits on total
    series resistance of the test apparatus added to test procedures."
