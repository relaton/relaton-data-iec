    <p>This document specifies one method for authenticated encryption suitable for applications requiring lightweight cryptographic mechanisms.</p>
    <p>This method processes a data string with the following security objectives:</p>
    <p>a) data confidentiality, i.e. protection against unauthorized disclosure of data,</p>
    <p>b) data integrity, i.e. protection that enables the recipient of data to verify that it has not been modified.</p>
    <p>Optionally, this method can provide data origin authentication, i.e. protection that enables the recipient of data to verify the identity of the data originator.</p>
    <p>The method specified in this document is based on a lightweight stream cipher, and requires the parties of the protected data to share a secret key for this algorithm. Key management is outside the scope of this document.</p>
    <p>NOTE      Key management techniques are defined in the ISO/IEC 11770 series.</p>
