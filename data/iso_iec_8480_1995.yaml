- content: Specifies the procedures for back-up operation applicable to data transmission
    on a leased line when implemented through a single interface, controlling both
    the leased and the back-up facilities, using ITU-T Recommendation V.24 interchange
    circuits in conjunction with either the 25-pole connector (ISO 2110) or the 26-pole
    connector (ISO/IEC 11569). Cancels and replaces the first edition, which has been
    technically revised.
