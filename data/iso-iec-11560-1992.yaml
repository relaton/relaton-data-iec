  content: "<p>Specifies definitions of the essential concepts, the environment in
    which the characteristics are to be tested, the environments in which the cartridge
    is to be operated and stored, the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics
    of the case and of the optical disk, the magneto-optical characteristics and the
    recording characteristics, so as to provide physical interchangeability between
    data processing systems, the format for the physical disposition of the tracks
    and sectors, the error correction codes, the modulation method used for recording
    and the quality of the recorded signals.</p>"
