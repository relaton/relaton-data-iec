abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2017 specifies the purpose and content of all identified
    systems and software life-cycle and service management information items (documentation).
    The information item contents are defined according to generic document types,
    as presented in Clause 7, and the specific purpose of the document (Clause 10).<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2017 assumes an organization is performing life-cycle
    processes, or practicing service management, using one or more of the following:<br
    />\r\n- ISO/IEC 12207:2008 (IEEE Std 12207-2008), Systems and software engineering?
    Software life cycle processes;<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015, Systems and
    software engineering? System life cycle processes;<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011
    (IEEE Std 20000-1:2013), Information technology? Service management? Part 1: Service
    management system requirements; and<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC 20000-2 (IEEE Std 20000-2:2013),
    Information technology? Service management? Part 2: Guidance on the application
    of service management systems.<br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE 15289:2017 provides a mapping
    of processes from the above standards to a set of information items. It provides
    a consistent approach to meeting the information and documentation requirements
    of systems and software engineering and IT service management.<br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE
    15289:2017 does not establish a service management system."
