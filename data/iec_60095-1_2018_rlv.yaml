abstract:
- content: "CORRECTED VERSION 2026-02<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018 RLV contains
    both the official IEC International Standard and its Redline version. The Redline
    version is available in English only and provides you with a quick and easy way
    to compare all the changes between the official IEC Standard and its previous
    edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018 is applicable to lead-acid batteries
    with a nominal voltage of 12 V, used primarily as a power source for the starting
    of internal combustion engines, lighting, and for auxiliary equipment of internal
    combustion engine vehicles. These batteries are commonly called \"starter batteries\".<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to batteries for the following purposes:<br
    />\r\n• batteries for passenger cars;<br />\r\n• batteries for commercial and
    industrial vehicles.<br />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018 is not applicable to batteries
    for other purposes, such as the starting of railcar internal combustion engines
    or for motorcycles and other power sport vehicles. IEC 60095-1:2018 defines many
    general properties of lead-acid batteries. Single sections can be referenced in
    other parts of the IEC 60095 series even if the application is excluded in the
    scope of this document. This document specifies the:<br />\r\n• general requirements;<br
    />\r\n• essential functional characteristics, relevant test methods and results
    required,<br />\r\nfor several classes of starter batteries:<br />\r\n• according
    to the general type of application;<br />\r\n• according to the type of product.<br
    />\r\nIEC 60095-1:2018 cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in 2006.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    charge acceptance test;<br />\r\nb) cranking performance test;<br />\r\nc) charge
    retention test; and<br />\r\nd) endurance test added.<br />\r\nThe content of
    the corrigendum 1 (2026-02) has been included in this copy."
