  content: "IEC 60335-2-4:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-4:2021
    deals with the safety of stand-alone electric spin extractors and spin extractors
    incorporated in washing machines that have separate containers for washing and
    spin extraction for household and similar purposes that have a capacity not exceeding
    10 kg of dry cloth and a drum peripheral speed not exceeding 50 m/s, their rated
    voltages being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other
    appliances. Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    may be a source of danger to the public, such as spin extractors intended to be
    used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, and spin extractors for
    communal use in blocks of flats or in launderettes, are within the scope of this
    standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards
    presented by appliances which are encountered by all persons in and around the
    home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces
    the sixth edition published in 2008, Amendment 1:2012 and Amendment 2:2017. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5, and its Amendments 1 and 2;<br />\r\n-
    replacement of the term definition of accessible part to include test probe 18;<br
    />\r\n- addition of test probe 18 for accessibility of live parts.<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the fifth edition of IEC 60335-1:2010
    and its amendments."
