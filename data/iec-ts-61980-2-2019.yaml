  content: "IEC TS 61980-2:2019 applies to communication between electric road vehicle
    (EV) and wireless power transfer (WPT) systems when connected to the supply network,
    at standard supply voltages per IEC 60038 up to 1000 V AC and up to 1500 V DC.<br
    />\r\nThis document also applies to wireless power transfer equipment supplied
    from on-site storage systems (e.g. buffer batteries) at standard supply voltages
    per IEC 60038 up to 1000 V AC and up to 1500 V DC.<br />\r\nThe aspects covered
    in this document include<br />\r\n– standards for operational characteristics
    and functional characteristics of the WPT communication subsystem,<br />\r\n–
    communication requirements for WPT system while driving, which are under consideration,<br
    />\r\n– communication requirements for two- and three-wheel vehicles, which are
    under consideration, and<br />\r\n– communication requirements for bidirectional
    power transfer are under consideration<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to<br
    />\r\n– safety aspects related to maintenance, and<br />\r\n– trolley buses, rail
    vehicles and vehicles designed primarily for use off-road."
