abstract:
- content: IEC GUIDE 115:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC Guide 115:2021 presents
    a practical approach to the application of uncertainty of measurement to conformity
    assessment activities in the electrotechnical sector. It is specifically conceived
    for use in IECEE Schemes as well as by testing laboratories engaged in testing
    electrical products to national safety standards. It describes the application
    of uncertainty of measurement principles and provides guidance on making uncertainty
    of measurement calculations. It also gives some examples relating to uncertainty
    of measurement calculations for product conformity assessment testing. IEC Guide
    115 has been prepared by the IECEE Committee of Testing Laboratories (CTL) to
    provide guidance on the practical application of the measurement uncertainty requirements
    of ISO/IEC 17025 to the electrical safety testing conducted within the IECEE CB
    Scheme. The IECEE CB Scheme is a multilateral, international agreement, among
    over 40 countries and some 60 national certification bodies, for the acceptance
    of test reports on electrical products tested to IEC standards.The aim of the
    CTL is, among other tasks, to define a common understanding of the test methodology
    with regard to the IEC standards as well as to ensure and continually improve
    the repeatability and reproducibility of test results among the member laboratories.
    The practical approach to measurement uncertainty outlined in this document has
    been adopted for use in the IECEE Schemes, and is also extensively used around
    the world by testing laboratories engaged in testing electrical products to national
    safety standards.</p>
