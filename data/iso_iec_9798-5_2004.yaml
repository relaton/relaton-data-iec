abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 9798-5:2004 specifies authentication mechanisms in the form
    of exchange of information between a claimant and a verifier.</p><p>In accordance
    with the types of calculations that need to be performed by a claimant and the
    verifier (see Annex C), the mechanisms specified in ISO/IEC 9798-5:2004 can be
    classified into four main groups.</p><ul><li>The first group is characterized
    by the performance of short modular exponentiations. The challenge size needs
    to be optimized since it has a proportional impact on workloads.</li><li>The second
    group is characterized by the possibility of a "coupon" strategy for the claimant.
    A verifier can authenticate a claimant without computational power. The challenge
    size has no impact on workloads.</li><li>The third group is characterized by the
    possibility of a "coupon" strategy for the verifier. A verifier without computational
    power can authenticate a claimant. The challenge size has no impact on workloads.</li><li>The
    fourth group has no possibility of a "coupon" strategy.</li></ul>
