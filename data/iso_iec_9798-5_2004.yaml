abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9798-5:2004 specifies authentication mechanisms in the form of
    exchange of information between a claimant and a verifier.In accordance with the
    types of calculations that need to be performed by a claimant and the verifier
    (see Annex C), the mechanisms specified in ISO/IEC 9798-5:2004 can be classified
    into four main groups.The first group is characterized by the performance of short
    modular exponentiations. The challenge size needs to be optimized since it has
    a proportional impact on workloads.The second group is characterized by the possibility
    of a "coupon" strategy for the claimant. A verifier can authenticate a claimant
    without computational power. The challenge size has no impact on workloads.The
    third group is characterized by the possibility of a "coupon" strategy for the
    verifier. A verifier without computational power can authenticate a claimant.
    The challenge size has no impact on workloads.The fourth group has no possibility
    of a "coupon" strategy.
