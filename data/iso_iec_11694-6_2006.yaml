abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11694-6:2006 is one of a series of standards describing the parameters
    for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage and interchange
    of digital data.ISO/IEC 11694 recognizes the existence of different methods of
    recording and reading information on optical memory cards, the characteristics
    of which are specific to the recording method employed. ISO/IEC 11694-6:2006 is
    specific to optical memory cards using the linear recording method and standardizes
    a method for the use of biometrics on an optical memory card.
