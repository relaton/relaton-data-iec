abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    8473-1:1998 This Recommendation | International Standard specifies a protocol
    that is used to provide the connectionless-mode Network service described in ITU-T
    Rec. X.213 | ISO/IEC 8348 and to perform certain Network layer management functions.
    The protocol relies upon the provision of an underlying connectionless-mode service
    by real subnetworks and/or data links. The underlying connectionless-mode service
    assumed by the protocol may be obtained either directly, from a connectionless-mode
    real subnetwork, or indirectly, through the operation of an appropriate Subnetwork
    Dependent Convergence Function (SNDCF) or Protocol (SNDCP) over a connection-mode
    real subnetwork, as described in ISO/IEC 8648. This Recommendation | International
    Standard specifies the operation of the protocol with respect to a uniform, abstract
    \"underlying subnetwork service\". Other Recommendations | International Standards
    specify the way in which this \"underlying subnetwork service\" is obtained from
    real subnetworks, such as those which conform to ISO/IEC 8802 or ISO/IEC 8208.
    The \"underlying subnetwork service\" may be obtained from real subnetworks other
    than those that are specifically covered by the other Recommendations | International
    Standards. This Recommendation | International Standard specifies:<br />\r\na)
    procedures for the connectionless transmission of data and control information
    from one Network entity to one or more peer Network entities;<br />\r\nb) the
    encoding of the Protocol Data Units (PDUs) used for the transmission of data and
    control information, comprising a variable-length protocol header format;<br />\r\nc)
    procedures for the correct interpretation of protocol control information; and<br
    />\r\nd) the functional requirements for implementations claiming conformance
    to this Recommendation | International Standard.<br />\r\nThe procedures are defined
    in terms of:<br />\r\na) the interactions among peer Network entities through
    the exchange of protocol data units;<br />\r\nb) the interactions between a Network
    entity and a Network service user through the exchange of Network service primitives;
    and<br />\r\nc) the interactions between a Network entity and an abstract underlying
    service provider through the exchange of service primitives. This Recommendation
    | International Standard also provides the PICS proforma for this protocol, in
    compliance with the relevant requirements, and in accordance with the relevant
    guidance, given in ITU-T Rec. X.290 | ISO/IEC 9646-1"
