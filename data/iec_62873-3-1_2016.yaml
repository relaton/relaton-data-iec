abstract:
- content: IEC 62873-3-1:2016(E) applies to RCDs equipped with screwless terminals,
    for current not exceeding 20 A primarily suitable for connecting unprepared (see
    3.5) copper conductors of cross-section up to 4 mm<sup>2</sup>. This part of IEC
    62873 cannot be used alone but it is intended to be applied together with an RCD
    product standard (IEC 61008-1 or IEC 61009-1) if an RCD is equipped with screwless
    terminals.
