  content: IEC/TR 62711:2011(E) provides recommendations for consistent use of mnemonics
    and qualifying symbols to be applied to symbols representing devices used in systems
    for monitoring, protection, switching, and controlling of apparatus in electrical
    substations, generating stations, power utilization and conversion facilities,
    and equipment designed for automatic protection of power systems. The recommendations
    are intended for designers, manufacturers and engineers of such systems.
