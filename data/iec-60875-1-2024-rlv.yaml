  content: "IEC 60875-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60875-1:2024
    applies to non-wavelength-selective fibre optic branching devices, all exhibiting
    the following features:<br />\r\n- they are passive, in that they contain no optoelectronic
    or other transducing elements;<br />\r\n- they have three or more ports for either
    the entry or exit, or both, of optical power, and share optical power among these
    ports in a predetermined fashion;<br />\r\n- the ports are optical fibres, or
    optical fibre connectors.<br />\r\nThis document establishes uniform requirements
    for the optical, mechanical and environmental properties. This seventh edition
    cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) removal of variant and
    reference extensions in clause classification<br />\r\nb) removal of specification
    system in clause documentation<br />\r\nc) removal of interface standards, reliability
    standards and interlinking in clause standardization system"
