abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24791-3:2022 This document defines interfaces for device management
    of RFID systems. Interfaces are defined that provide for discovery, configuration,
    initialization and monitoring of RFID systems within the software system infrastructure
    (SSI).<br />\r\nThis document only deals with devices that provide RFID related
    services. It does not distinguish the form factor of such RFID devices.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides two distinct interface sets, one based on the GS1 EPCglobal
    DCI standard and the IETF SNMP RFCs and the other based on the Organization for
    the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) DPWS standard. The
    definition of the Device Profile for RFID is referred to in this document as the
    RFID Device Management Profile, or RDMP.<br />\r\nEach interface option set provides
    interface definitions that provide ISO/IEC 24791-3 Client Endpoints and Services
    Endpoints with the mechanisms for:<br />\r\n- the discovery of the RFID devices
    and services on a local or remote subnet;<br />\r\n- a firmware upgrade service;<br
    />\r\n- a management service that implements configuration related functions;<br
    />\r\n- a monitoring service for reporting alerts, diagnostics, and performance
    information.<br />\r\nThe two interface set definitions provided by this document
    allow for clients and services endpoints to implement and provide the services
    based on the specific characteristics of the RFID system to be implemented. Subclause
    1.2 defines the Conformance requirements for systems that implement components
    of one or both of the interface sets."
