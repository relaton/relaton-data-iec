  content: "IEC TR 62222:2021 describes the test methods for various parameters relating
    to the reaction to fire properties of metallic and optical fibre communications
    cables. The parameters have particular importance for cables intended to be installed
    within buildings and other structures. This document also maps the test methods
    and associated limits applied to the fire hazards created by particular installation
    conditions and which can be referenced by other international, regional and national
    standards. For example, it is important that compliance with the requirements
    and recommendations for installation methods in ISO/IEC 14763-2 taking into consideration
    this document improve safety concerning fire.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2012. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Scope rewritten to clarify and bring into line current understanding from other
    technical sources;<br />\r\n- Normative References updated to be in line with
    the most recent technical definitions and new additions;<br />\r\n- new additional
    terms and definitions added to Annex F since these are not used in the document;<br
    />\r\n- new inclusions to the list of abbreviated terms, some corrections;<br
    />\r\n- project reports are now in Annex E, for information only;<br />\r\n- Subclause
    about mitigation of fire hazards, about fire protection, updated with clearer
    information on standards plus updates where new standards have been published
    or amended;<br />\r\n- test methods, test methods conclusions and fire performance
    updated."
