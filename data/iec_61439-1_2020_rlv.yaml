abstract:
- content: "IEC 61439-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61439-1:2020 lays down the
    general definitions and service conditions, construction requirements, technical
    characteristics and verification requirements for low-voltage switchgear and controlgear
    assemblies. NOTE Throughout this document, the term assembly(s) (see 3.1.1) is
    used for a low-voltage switchgear and controlgear assembly(s). For the purpose
    of determining assembly conformity, the requirements of the relevant part of the
    IEC 61439 series, Part 2 onwards, apply together with the cited requirements of
    this document. For assemblies not covered by Part 3 onward, Part 2 applies. This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2011. It constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) clarification that power
    electric converter systems, switch mode power supplies, uninterruptable power
    supplies and adjustable speed power drive systems are tested to their particular
    products standard, but when they are incorporated in assemblies the incorporation
    is in accordance with the IEC 61439 series of standards;<br />\r\nb) introduction
    of a group rated current for circuits within a loaded assembly and the refocusing
    of temperature-rise verification on this new characteristic;<br />\r\nc) addition
    of requirements in respect of DC;<br />\r\nd) introduction of the concept of class
    I and class II assemblies regarding protection against electric shock.<br />\r\nThe
    contents of the corrigendum of December 2021 have been included in this copy.</p>"
