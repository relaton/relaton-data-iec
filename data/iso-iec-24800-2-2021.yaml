    <p>This document specifies a series of interfaces to allow disparate systems an interoperable management of image repositories. It also specifies the general rules which govern the usage of metadata in JPSearch and provides a specification which</p>
    <ul>
    <li>provides rules for the representation of image metadata descriptions, consisting of the definition of the JPSearch Core Metadata Schema,</li>
    <li>provides rules for the publication of machine-readable translations between metadata terms belonging to proprietary metadata schemas and metadata terms in the JPSearch Core Metadata Schema, and</li>
    <li>provides rules for the registration and request of metadata schemas and its translation rules or links to them.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>JPSearch is an extensible standard. The method of extending the structures and rules beyond the JPSearch Core Metadata Schema is provided in this document.</p>
