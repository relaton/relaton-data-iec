abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21889:2001 This International Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the
    support of the Call Identification and Call Linkage Additional Network Feature
    (ANF-CIDL) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Network Services
    Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network
    (PISN).<br />\r\nANF-CIDL is an additional network feature which allows the assignment
    of a Global Call Identification (GID) to identify a call end-to-end over the call
    route (i.e. between the two end PINXs). As an option, a Thread Identification
    (TID) may be assigned to different calls which are logically linked together due
    to the operation of other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Additionally a Leg
    Identification (LID) may be assigned, to identify the different legs of a call.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 - This ANF has been developed to support the use of CSTA (ISO/IEC
    18051) in a networked environment, i.e. in a PISN. Use of this ANF for other applications
    is not precluded.<br />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br
    />\r\nSupplementary Service specifications are produced in three stages and according
    to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This<br />\r\nInternational Standard contains
    the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements
    identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 21888.<br />\r\nThe
    signalling protocol for ANF-CIDL operates on top of the signalling protocol for
    basic circuit switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain
    aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nThis International Standard also specifies additional
    signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference
    point between Call Identification and Call Linkage and other supplementary services
    and ANFs.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is applicable to PINXs which can
    be interconnected to form a PISN."
