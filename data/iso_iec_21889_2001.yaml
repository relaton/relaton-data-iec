abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the
    support of the Call Identification and Call Linkage</p><p>Additional Network Feature
    (ANF-CIDL) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Network Services
    Exchanges</p><p>(PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services
    Network (PISN).</p><p>ANF-CIDL is an additional network feature which allows the
    assignment of a Global Call Identification (GID) to identify a</p><p>call end-to-end
    over the call route (i.e. between the two end PINXs). As an option, a Thread Identification
    (TID) may be</p><p>assigned to different calls which are logically linked together
    due to the operation of other supplementary services and/or</p><p>ANFs. Additionally
    a Leg Identification (LID) may be assigned, to identify the different legs of
    a call.</p><p>NOTE 1 - This ANF has been developed to support the use of CSTA
    (ISO/IEC 18051) in a networked environment, i.e. in a PISN. Use of</p><p>this
    ANF for other applications is not precluded.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined
    in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Supplementary Service specifications are produced in
    three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This</p><p>International
    Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by</p><p>the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in
    ISO/IEC 21888.</p><p>The signalling protocol for ANF-CIDL operates on top of the
    signalling protocol for basic circuit switched call control, as</p><p>specified
    in ISO/IEC 11572, and uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control
    of supplementary services</p><p>specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>This International
    Standard also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support
    of interactions at the Q</p><p>reference point between Call Identification and
    Call Linkage and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>This International
    Standard is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN.</p>"
