abstract:
- content: "1.1 Fields of application<p>ISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 is applicable to Very
    Small Entities (VSEs). The lifecycle processes described in ISO/IEC 29110 are
    not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than
    VSEs. However, certain issues faced by large organizations might not be covered
    by ISO/IEC 29110.</p><p>The lifecycle processes defined in ISO/IEC 29110 can be
    used by VSEs when acquiring and using, as well as when creating and supplying,
    a software, and systems. They can be applied at any level in a software and systems
    structure and at any stage in the lifecycle. The processes described in ISO/IEC
    29110 are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes
    that VSEs find useful.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29110-2-1:2015 introduces the major concepts
    for software and systems engineering profiles for VSEs, and defines the terms
    common to the set of documents associated with VSE profiles.</p><p>It establishes
    the logic behind the definition and application of profiles. It specifies the
    elements common to all standardized profiles (structure, conformance, assessment).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    29110-2-1:2015 is applicable to all profiles.</p>\r\n1.2 Target audience<p>ISO/IEC
    29110-2-1:2015 is targeted at authors and reviewers of standardized profiles,
    authors of other parts, and authors of other VSE profiles.</p>"
