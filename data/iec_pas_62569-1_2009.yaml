abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 62569-1:2009(E) is intended as the first part of a standard series
    defining methods and guidelines for the establishing of generic electronic specifications
    of information for products (including plants, systems, equipment or components,
    in the following all called products), along its life cycle for later use e.g.
    in the procurement, operating and maintenance. The IEC 62569 series provides qualifiers
    to be used in addition to the properties considering life cycle and other aspects.
    It is a prerequisite for the other parts of this series. The IEC 62569 series
    is prepared to transfer the former paper-based applications of blank detail specifications
    or product descriptions towards supporting the electronic business allowing the
    evaluation and management of described items by computers. IEC 62569 Series provides
    principles and methods for the specification of products by properties, e.g. in
    data sheets. It uses data element types defined in the data dictionary of IEC
    61360.
