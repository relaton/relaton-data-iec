abstract:
- content: "<p>The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a
    description of a mechanism for transferring</p><p>information between modelling
    tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing
    and</p><p>exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform
    to CDIF. The language that is defined for</p><p>the transfer format also has applicability
    as a general language for import/export from repositories. The CDIF</p><p>semantic
    metamodel defined for CASE also has applicability as the basis of standard definitions
    for use in</p><p>repositories.</p><p>The standards which form the complete family
    of CDIF standards are documented in ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002,</p><p><em>Information
    technology — CDIF framework — Part 1: Overview.</em>These standards cover the
    overall framework, the</p><p>transfer format and the CDIF semantic metamodel.</p><p/><p><strong>Figure
    1</strong>−<strong>CDIF family of standards</strong></p><p>The diagram in Figure
    1 depicts the various standards that comprise the CDIF family of standards. The
    shaded box</p><p>depicts this Standard and its position in the CDIF family of
    standards.</p><p>This standard defines the Common Subject Area of the CDIF semantic
    metamodel. This subject area contains</p><p>meta-objects that are used as the
    basis of the other subject area standards, and also meta-relationships and metaattributes</p><p>that
    are applicable to all meta-objects.</p><p>This document is intended to be used
    by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document provides</p><p>a
    definition of a single subject area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. It is suitable
    for:</p><p> Those evaluating CDIF,</p><p> Those who wish to understand the principles
    and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and</p><p> Those developing importers and exporters.</p><p>This
    document, ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002<em>, Information technology — CDIF framework —
    Part 1: Overview</em>, and the</p><p>Framework document ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002<em>,
    Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 2: Modelling and</em></p><p><em>extensibility</em>,
    should be read first when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read
    other documents in the</p><p>CDIF family of standards.</p><p>While there are no
    specific prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful for the reader
    to have familiarity</p><p>with the following:</p><p> Entity-Relationship-Attribute
    modelling;</p><p> Modelling (CASE) tools;</p><p> Information repositories;</p><p>
    Data dictionaries;</p><p> Multiple meta-layer modelling.</p>"
