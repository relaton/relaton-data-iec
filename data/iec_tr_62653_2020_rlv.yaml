abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62653:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 62653:2020
    describes the technical recommendations for use of medical equipment in chronic
    Haemodialysis, Haemofiltration and Haemodiafiltration. These principles are important
    to be complied with to ensure safe, permissible and appropriate application. The
    term Haemodialysis is used in this document as synonym for all therapy modalities.<br
    />\r\nThe scope can be applicable to the use of the medical equipment in home,
    acute and pediatrics environment. The scope may also be applicable to Sorbent
    Dialysis Systems.<br />\r\nThe physician is responsible for the treatment prescription.
    However, the Organization administering the treatment is responsible for all resources,
    structures and processes used in connection with the treatment. These responsibilities
    will not be described here. The requirements of IEC 60601-2-16 ensure that medical
    electrical equipment used for extracorporeal renal replacement therapy operates
    with a high level of safety. Despite that high level of safety, however, some
    residual risk remains, related to medical-biological, physical-chemical and technical
    Hazards. The Organization administering the treatment is responsible for managing
    the residual risk. This document is not intended to be used as the basis of regulatory
    inspection or certification assessment activities. IEC TR 62653:2020 cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) update the relevant references to
    the new numbering scheme of the ISO 23500 family;<br />\r\nb) alignment with IEC
    60601-1:2005 and IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012, IEC 62353:2014 and 60601-2-16:2018;<br
    />\r\nc) technical additions in several sections."
