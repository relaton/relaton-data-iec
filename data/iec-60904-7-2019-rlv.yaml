  content: "IEC 60904-7:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60904-7:2019 describes
    the procedure for correcting the spectral mismatch error introduced in the testing
    of a photovoltaic device, caused by the mismatch between the test spectrum and
    the reference spectrum (e.g. AM1.5 spectrum) and by the mismatch between the spectral
    responsivities (SR) of the reference device and of the device under test and therewith
    reduce the systematic uncertainty. This procedure is valid for single-junction
    devices but the principle may be extended to cover multi-junction devices. The
    purpose of this document is to give guidelines for the correction of the spectral
    mismatch error, should there be a spectral mismatch between the test spectrum
    and the reference spectrum as well as between the reference device SR and the
    device under test SR. The calculated spectral mismatch correction is only valid
    for the specific combination of test and reference devices measured with a particular
    test spectrum. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2008. The main technical changes with respect to the previous edition are as
    follows:<br />\r\n- For better compatibility and less redundancy, the clause “Determination
    of test spectrum” refers to IEC 60904-9.<br />\r\n- The spectral mismatch factor
    is called SMM instead of MM to enable differentiation to the angular mismatch
    factor AMM and spectral angular mismatch factor SAMM.<br />\r\n- Formulae for
    the derivation and application of the spectral mismatch factor SMM are added.<br
    />\r\n- Links to new standards are given, e.g. concerning multi-junction devices.<br
    />\r\n- Corrected wording (responsivity instead of response and irradiance instead
    of intensity).</p>"
