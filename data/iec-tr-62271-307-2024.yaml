  content: "IEC TR 62271-307:2024 refers to prefabricated metal-enclosed and solid-insulation
    enclosed (both hereinafter called enclosed) switchgear and controlgear assemblies
    for alternating current of rated voltages above 1 kV and up to and including 52
    kV as specified in IEC 62271‑200 and IEC 62271‑201, and to other equipment included
    in the same enclosure with any possible mutual influence. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Structure
    of document updated.<br />\r\nb) Updated references to IEC 62271-200:2021 and
    IEC 62271-1:2017.<br />\r\nc) Addition of criteria for the extension of validity
    of type tests from functional unit(s) with a different insulating gas to the functional
    unit to be validated.<br />\r\nd) Figure 5 for the validation of a design modification
    was added.<br />\r\ne) Clause B.7 for the extension of validity of type test for
    a GIS with insulation gas A to insulation gas B was added."
