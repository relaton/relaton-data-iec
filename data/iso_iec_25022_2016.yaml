abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 25022:2016 defines quality in use measures for the characteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC 25010, and is intended to be used together with ISO/IEC 25010.
    It can be used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 2503n and the ISO/IEC 2504n standards
    or to more generally meet user needs with regard to product or system quality.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 25022:2016 contains the following:<br />\r\n- a basic set of measures
    for each quality in use characteristic;<br />\r\n- an explanation of how quality
    in use is measured.<br />\r\nIt provides a suggested set of quality in use measures
    to be used with the quality in use model in ISO/IEC 25010. They are not intended
    to be an exhaustive set.<br />\r\nIt includes as informative annexes examples
    of how to measure context coverage (Annex A), options for normalising quality
    in use measures (Annex B), use of ISO/IEC 25022 for measuring usability in ISO
    9241â€‘11 (Annex C), a quality in use evaluation process (Annex D), the relationship
    between different quality models (Annex E), and quality measurement concepts (Annex
    F).<br />\r\nThe measures are applicable to the use of any human-computer system,
    including both computer systems in use and software products that form part of
    the system.<br />\r\nIt does not assign ranges of values of the measures to rated
    levels or to grades of compliance because these values are defined for each system
    or product depending, on the context of use and users' needs.<br />\r\nSome attributes
    could have a desirable range of values, which does not depend on specific user
    needs but depends on generic factors, for example, human cognitive factors.<br
    />\r\nThe proposed quality in use measures are primarily intended to be used for
    quality assurance and management of systems and software products based on their
    effects when actually used. The main users of the measurement results are people
    managing development, acquisition, evaluation, or maintenance of software and
    systems.<br />\r\nThe main users of ISO/IEC 25022:2016 are people carrying out
    specification and evaluation activities as part of the following:<br />\r\n- development:
    including requirements analysis, design, and testing through acceptance during
    the life cycle process;<br />\r\n- quality management: systematic examination
    of the product or computer system, for example, when evaluating quality in use
    as part of quality assurance and quality control;<br />\r\n- supply: a contract
    with the acquirer for the supply of a system, software product, or software service
    under the terms of a contract, for example, when validating quality at qualification
    test;<br />\r\n- acquisition: including product selection and acceptance testing,
    when acquiring or procuring a system, software product, or software service from
    a supplier;<br />\r\n- maintenance: improvement of the product based on quality
    in use measures."
