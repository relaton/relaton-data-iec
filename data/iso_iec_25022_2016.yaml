abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25022:2016 defines quality in use measures for the characteristics
    defined in ISO/IEC 25010, and is intended to be used together with ISO/IEC 25010.
    It can be used in conjunction with the ISO/IEC 2503n and the ISO/IEC 2504n standards
    or to more generally meet user needs with regard to product or system quality.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    25022:2016 contains the following:</p><p>- a basic set of measures for each quality
    in use characteristic;</p><p>- an explanation of how quality in use is measured.</p><p>It
    provides a suggested set of quality in use measures to be used with the quality
    in use model in ISO/IEC 25010. They are not intended to be an exhaustive set.</p><p>It
    includes as informative annexes examples of how to measure context coverage (Annex
    A), options for normalising quality in use measures (Annex B), use of ISO/IEC
    25022 for measuring usability in ISO 9241â€‘11 (Annex C), a quality in use evaluation
    process (Annex D), the relationship between different quality models (Annex E),
    and quality measurement concepts (Annex F).</p><p>The measures are applicable
    to the use of any human-computer system, including both computer systems in use
    and software products that form part of the system.</p><p>It does not assign ranges
    of values of the measures to rated levels or to grades of compliance because these
    values are defined for each system or product depending, on the context of use
    and users' needs.</p><p>Some attributes could have a desirable range of values,
    which does not depend on specific user needs but depends on generic factors, for
    example, human cognitive factors.</p><p>The proposed quality in use measures are
    primarily intended to be used for quality assurance and management of systems
    and software products based on their effects when actually used. The main users
    of the measurement results are people managing development, acquisition, evaluation,
    or maintenance of software and systems.</p><p>The main users of ISO/IEC 25022:2016
    are people carrying out specification and evaluation activities as part of the
    following:</p><p>- development: including requirements analysis, design, and testing
    through acceptance during the life cycle process;</p><p>- quality management:
    systematic examination of the product or computer system, for example, when evaluating
    quality in use as part of quality assurance and quality control;</p><p>- supply:
    a contract with the acquirer for the supply of a system, software product, or
    software service under the terms of a contract, for example, when validating quality
    at qualification test;</p><p>- acquisition: including product selection and acceptance
    testing, when acquiring or procuring a system, software product, or software service
    from a supplier;</p><p>- maintenance: improvement of the product based on quality
    in use measures.</p>"
