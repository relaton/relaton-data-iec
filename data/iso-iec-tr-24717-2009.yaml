    <p>ISO/IEC TR 24717:2009 specifies the interfaces and behaviour of a common class library for managing sets of object references in COBOL. The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 24717:2009 is to promote a high degree of portability in implementations of the class library, even though some elements are subject to trial before completion of a final design suitable for standardization.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 24717:2009 builds on the syntax and semantics defined in ISO/IEC 1989:2002.</p>
