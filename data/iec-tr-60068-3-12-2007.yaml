  content: Presents two approaches to establish a possible temperature profile for
    a lead-free reflow soldering process using SnAgCu solder paste. The presented
    process window covers a great variety of electronic products, including a large
    range of package sizes (molded active electronic components, passive components
    and electromechanical components)
