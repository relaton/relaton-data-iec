  content: "IEC 61156-7:2023 specifies cables that can be used for various communication
    systems as well as for analogue systems, such as video, that exist or are under
    development and which may use as many as four pairs simultaneously. In this sense,
    this sectional specification provides the cable characteristics required by system
    developers to evaluate new systems as well as to enhance present systems. It covers
    a cable having four individually screened (S/FTP) pairs. The cable can be provided
    with a common screen over the cable core. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2003 and Amendment 1:2012. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. align clauses with IEC 61156-1:2023;<br />\r\nb. remove the clause related
    to screening attenuation as it is no longer a test to be performed (replaced by
    coupling attenuation);<br />\r\nc. replace the IEC 62153-4-2 method (injection
    clamp) with IEC 61156-4-5 (absorbing clamp) for coupling attenuation measurement
    to be consistent with all other parts of the IEC 61156 series;<br />\r\nd. include
    IEC 62153-4-9 test method (triaxial) for coupling attenuation measurement to be
    consistent with all other parts of the IEC 61156 series;<br />\r\ne. incorporate
    the blank detail specification."
