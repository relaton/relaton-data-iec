  content: "IEC TS 62257-12-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p style=\"text-align:left\">IEC
    TS 62257-12-1:2020 establishes the framework for creating a product specification
    for lamps and lighting appliances to serve as the basis for evaluating quality
    for a particular context. Product specifications include minimum requirements
    for quality standards, warranty requirements, and/or performance criteria. Products
    are compared to specifications based on test results and other information about
    the product. The product specification framework is flexible and can accommodate
    the goals of diverse organizations and institutions. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\n-
    Annex A and Annex B were combined into a single Annex A to eliminate duplicate
    tables and simplify the document.</p>"
