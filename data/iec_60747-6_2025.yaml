abstract:
- content: "IEC 60747-6:2025 specifies product specific standards for terminology,
    letter symbols, essential ratings and characteristics (properties), measuring
    and test methods, requirements for type tests, routine tests, endurance tests
    and marking for the following discrete semiconductor devices:<br />\r\n- reverse
    blocking triode thyristors;<br />\r\n- reverse conducting (triode) thyristors;<br
    />\r\n- bidirectional triode thyristors (triacs);<br />\r\n- turn-off thyristors.<br
    />\r\nIf no ambiguity is likely to result, any of the above will be referred to
    as thyristors.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the terms and definitions
    for partial thermal resistance junction-to-case and voltages related to ratings
    and characteristics (properties) have been added;<br />\r\nb) Clauses 3, 4, 5,
    6 and 7 were amended with some deletions of information no longer in use and with
    some necessary additions."
