    for defining, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining and

    any procurement and supply of products and services, such as manufacturing or
    assembly, business process procurement, software and hardware components, knowledge
    process procurement, Build-Operate-Transfer and cloud computing services.</p><p>These
    requirements are intended to be applicable to all organizations, regardless of

    have already internally implemented a number of foundational processes, or be
    actively planning to do so. These processes include, but are not limited to, the
    following: governance, business management, risk management, operational and human
    resources management, and information security.</p>"
