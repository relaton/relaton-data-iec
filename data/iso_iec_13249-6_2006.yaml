abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 13249 defines a number of packages of generic data types common
    to various kinds of data used in multimedia and application areas, to enable that
    data to be stored and manipulated in an SQL database.   ISO/IEC 13249-6:2006 introduces
    the data-mining package, gives the necessary references, defines notations and
    conventions specific to ISO/IEC 13249-6:2006, defines concepts specific to ISO/IEC
    13249-6:2006, and defines data mining user-defined types and their associated
    routines.   The data-mining user-defined types defined in ISO/IEC 13249-6:2006
    are generic to data-mining data handling. They address the need to store, manage
    and retrieve information based on elements such as data-mining models, data-mining
    settings, and data-mining test results.
