abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26513:2009 supports the interest of software users in receiving
    consistent, complete, accurate, and usable documentation. It defines the process
    in which user documentation products are tested.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 26513:2009
    is intended neither to encourage nor discourage the use of either printed or electronic
    (on-screen) media for documentation, or of any particular documentation testing
    or management tools or methodologies.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 specifies
    processes for use in testing and reviewing of user documentation. It is not limited
    to the test and review phase of the life cycle, but includes activities throughout
    the Information Management and Documentation Management processes.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    26513:2009 provides the minimum requirements for the testing and reviewing of
    user documentation, including both printed and on-screen documents used in the
    work environment by the users of systems software. It applies to printed user
    manuals, online help, tutorials, and user reference documentation.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    order of clauses in ISO/IEC 26513:2009 does not imply that the software user documentation
    should be tested in this order.<br /><br />\r\nIn each clause, the requirements
    are media-independent, as far as possible. The informative checklists found in
    Annexes A and B may be used at each phase of the documentation process to verify
    that the appropriate steps have been carried out, and that the finished product
    has acceptable quality.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 can be helpful for testing
    and reviewing the following types of documentation:<br />\r\n\t documentation
    of products other than software, for example, hardware or devices;<br />\r\n\t
    multimedia systems using animation, video, and sound;<br />\r\n\t computer-based
    training (CBT) packages and specialized course materials intended primarily for
    use in formal training programs;<br />\r\n\t documentation produced for installers,
    computer operators, or system administrators who are not end users;<br />\r\n\t
    maintenance documentation describing the internal operation of systems software.<br
    /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 is applicable to testers,
    reviewers, and other related roles, including a variety of specialists:<br />\r\n\t
    usability testers, documentation reviewers, and subject-matter experts;<br />\r\n\t
    information designers and architects who plan the structure and format of products
    in a documentation set;<br />\r\n\t usability specialists and business analysts
    who identify the tasks the intended users will perform with the software.<br /><br
    /><br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nIt can also be consulted by those with other roles
    and interests in the documentation process.<br /><br />\r\nManagers of the software
    development process or the documentation process should consider the testing of
    documentation as part of their planning and management activities. Project managers,
    in particular, have an important role in planning the testing and reviewing of
    documentation.<br /><br />\r\nTesting of the documentation is likely to highlight
    any defects or nonconformances in tools that are used to create or display on-screen
    documentation. Similarly, usability testing of the documentation is likely to
    highlight defects or nonconformances with the presentation or layout of documentation
    and associated graphics and other media. As a result, there are a number of roles
    that should be involved in the testing of documentation because their work affects
    the content, display or presentation of documentation for the user, for example,
    developers of tools for creating on-screen documentation, graphic designers producing
    material displayed as part of the documentation, and human-factors experts who
    identify principles for making documentation more accessible and easily used,
    also user interface designers and ergonomics experts working together to design
    the presentation of the documentation on-screen. In some organizations these roles
    may have different titles, or an individual may perform more than one of these
    roles.<br /><br />\r\nThere are other roles that need to understand the test processes
    for the documentation, for example authors should understand the test processed
    for the documentation that they have produced, and acquirers of documentation
    prepared by another department or organization, might want to know what testing
    has been performed and the processes followed for the documentation that they
    are acquiring from a supplier.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 is intended for
    use in all types of organizations, whether or not a dedicated documentation department
    is present. In all cases, it may be used as a basis for local standards and procedures.
    Readers are assumed to have experience or general knowledge of testing or reviewing
    processes.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 26513:2009 deals with the evaluation of documentation
    only, and not with the evaluation of the software it supports. Documentation is
    also included in evaluation of the software product, as in the ISO/IEC 25000 series
    of standards, in particular, ISO/IEC 25051:2006<em>Software engineering — Software
    product Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) — Requirements for quality
    of Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) software product and instructions for testing.</em>"
