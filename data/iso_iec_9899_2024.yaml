abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoNormal">This document specifies the form and establishes the
    interpretation of programs written in the C programming language. It is designed
    to promote the portability of C programs among a variety of data-processing systems.
    It is intended for use by implementers and programmers. It specifies:</p><p class="MsoNormal">—
    the representation of C programs;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the syntax and constraints
    of the C language;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the semantic rules for interpreting
    C programs;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the representation of input data to be processed
    by C programs;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the representation of output data produced
    by C programs;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the restrictions and limits imposed by
    a conforming implementation of C.</p><p class="MsoNormal">This document does not
    specify:</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the mechanism by which C programs are transformed
    for use by a data-processing system;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the mechanism by
    which C programs are invoked for use by a data-processing system;</p><p class="MsoNormal">—
    the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C program;</p><p
    class="MsoNormal">— the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being
    produced by a C program;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— the size or complexity of a
    program and its data that will exceed the capacity of any specific data-processing
    system or the capacity of a particular processor;</p><p class="MsoNormal">— all
    minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting
    a conforming implementation.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Annex J gives an overview
    of portability issues that a C program can encounter.</p>
