abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-20-10:2017 is compliant with UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [14].<br
    />\r\nThis service type enables control over the transport of audio and video
    streams. The service type defines a common model for A/V transport control suitable
    for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide variety of disc,
    tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players, VCRs and MP3 players.
    A minimal implementation of this service can be used to control tuners.<br />\r\nThe
    service type is related to the ConnectionManager service type, which describes
    A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory service, which offers
    meta-information about the resource stored on the media. AVTransport also offers
    an action to retrieve any metadata embedded in the resource itself.<br />\r\nThis
    service type does not offer scheduled recording."
