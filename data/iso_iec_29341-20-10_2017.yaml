abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-20-10:2017 is compliant with UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [14].</p><p>This service type enables control over the transport of
    audio and video streams. The service type defines a common model for A/V transport
    control suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide
    variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players,
    VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to
    control tuners.</p><p>The service type is related to the ConnectionManager service
    type, which describes A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory
    service, which offers meta-information about the resource stored on the media.
    AVTransport also offers an action to retrieve any metadata embedded in the resource
    itself.</p><p>This service type does not offer scheduled recording.</p>"
