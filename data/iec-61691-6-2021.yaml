  content: IEC 61691-6:2021(E) defines IEC 61691-6/IEEE Std 1076.1 language, a hardware
    description language for the description and the simulation of analog, digital,
    and mixed-signal systems. The language, also informally known as VHDL-AMS, is
    built on the IEC 61691-1-1/IEEE 1076 (VHDL) language and extends it to provide
    capabilities of writing and simulating analog and mixed-signal models. This standard
    is published as a double logo IEC-IEEE standard.
