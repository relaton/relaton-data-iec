    <p>ISO/IEC 18000 has been developed in order to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>provide a framework to define common communications protocols for Internationally useable frequencies for radio frequency identification (RFID), and, where possible, to determine the use of the same protocols for all frequencies such that the problems of migrating from one to another are diminished; </li>
    <li>minimize software and implementation costs; </li>
    <li>enable system management and control and information exchange to be common as far as is possible.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-1 provides explanation of the concepts behind ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010 has 3 MODES of operation, intended to address different applications. The detailed technical differences between the modes are shown in parameter tables.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010 provides physical layer, collision management system and protocol values for RFID systems for item identification operating at 13,56 MHz in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 18000-1.</p>
    <p>It provides definitions for systems for each MODE determined in ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010.</p>
    <p>It defines three non-interfering MODES.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The MODES are not interoperable.</li>
    <li>The MODES, whilst not interoperable, are non-interfering.</li>
    </ul>
