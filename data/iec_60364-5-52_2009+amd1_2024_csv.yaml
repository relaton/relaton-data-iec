    minor changes with regard to busbar trunking systems and powertrack systems.<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 523.6 introduces minor changes with regard to the sizing of
    cables where harmonic currents are present.<br />\r\n- A new sublause 523.9 concerning
    single-core cables with a metallic covering has been introduced.<br />\r\n- Clause
    525 introduces changes in the maximum value of voltage drop permitted between
    the origin of the consumer's installation and the equipment which should not be
    greater than that given in the relevant annex.<br />\r\n- Clause 526 introduces
    minor changes to electrical connections including additional exceptions for inspection
    of connections and additional notes.<br />\r\n- Clause 528 introduces additional
    requirements with regard to proximity of underground power and telecommunication
    cables.<br />\r\n- Clause 529 introduces minor changes to selection and erection
    of wiring systems in relation to maintainability, including cleaning.<br />\r\nThe
