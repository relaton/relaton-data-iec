  content: This technical report gives framework guidelines for collecting environmental
    data of insulating materials useful to engineers and designers of electrotechnical
    products for evaluating environmental impacts. It also provides a guideline for
    common format in environmental data reporting. This will enable producers to more
    easily evaluate the potential environmental impacts of those electrotechnical
    products using solid insulating materials.
