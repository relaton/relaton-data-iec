- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Provides guidance on atmospheric radiation effects on avionics electronics
    used in aircraft operating at altitudes up to 60 000 feet (18,3 km). Defines the
    radiation environment, the effects of that environment on electronics and provides
    design considerations for the accommodation of those effects within avionics systems.
    Is intended to help aerospace equipment manufacturers and designers to standardise
    their approach to single event effects in avionics.
