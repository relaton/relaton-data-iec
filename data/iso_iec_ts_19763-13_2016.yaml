abstract:
- content: The primary purpose of the ISO/IEC 19763 series is to specify a metamodel
    framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC TS 19763-13(E) specifies a metamodel for
    registering form designs.<p>ISO/IEC TS 19763-13(E) provides a metamodel to describe
    the structure and semantics of an implemented form devoid of any specific, domain
    semantics, e.g. in healthcare, social science, e-government and e-business, or
    representation format so that data may be faithfully exchanged between systems
    and system components, and associations expressed between sets of form designs
    whose data may be compared, joined or composed for analysis.</p>
