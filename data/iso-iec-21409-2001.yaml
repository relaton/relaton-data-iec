    <p>This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between "QSIG" and "H.323" in support of generic functional</p>
    <p>procedures for supplementary services within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).</p>
    <p>"QSIG" is a signalling protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services eXchanges (PINX)</p>
    <p>within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides</p>
    <p>circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards, in particular</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services), ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of</p>
    <p>supplementary services) and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services.</p>
    <p>"H.323" is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia communication within a packet network, in</p>
    <p>particular a packet network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling</p>
    <p>protocols operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one or more gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint</p>
    <p>can be a terminal or a gateway to another network. H.323 is an "umbrella" recommendation, referring to various ITU-T</p>
    <p>recommendations, in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities) and</p>
    <p>Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services).</p>
    <p>NOTE - H.450.1 applies to the 1998 version of H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.</p>
    <p>Interworking between QSIG and H.323 permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user of an IP network, or</p>
    <p>a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate at a user of a PISN. In addition this International Standard enables the</p>
    <p>participants of a call to exchange supplementary service control information in a generic way. The more specific aspects of</p>
    <p>interworking particular supplementary services are specified in other Standards.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG</p>
    <p>and an IP network employing H.323.</p>
