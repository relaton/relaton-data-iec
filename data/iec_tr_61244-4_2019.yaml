abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61244-4:2019(E) provides general guidance for the evaluation/verification
    of electrical insulation materials (EIM) and electrical insulation systems (EIS)
    intended to be used in types of equipment exposed to ionizing radiation. Beside
    sensors, actuators/motors as well as plugs and terminals, cables are a well-known
    typical application of those EIM and EIS. Their type spectrum covers low voltage
    power cables, control cables and instrumentation cables. Because of their comparable
    simple design, cables are the ideal type of equipment to study EIM and EIS degradation
    processes. But the results of these studies can be easily transferred to the enumerated
    types of equipment.<br />\r\nNonetheless, this document provides a state-of-the
    art report on qualification/verification procedures used to simulate simultaneous
    effects of temperature and radiation at varying intensities rather than give detailed
    test programmes valid for specific test methods.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Use of this document
    with specific products can require specification of additional product related
    procedures.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Some of the procedures described in this document
    are emerging technologies. Therefore, specified prerequisites, former experiences
    as well as boundary conditions can be additionally taken into account."
