abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    24824-2:2006 specifies the messages required for Fast Web Services. It provides
    the specification of ASN.1 SOAP messages which carry the same semantics as W3C
    SOAP messages. The exchange of ASN.1 SOAP messages provides Fast Web Services.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 24824-2:2006 references other ASN.1 International Standards and
    the Web services specification W3C SOAP 1.2 to fully define application exchanges
    that use Web protocols and W3C SOAP functionality. This is an extension to the
    provision of Web services using W3C SOAP messages, without any change to the functionality
    of W3C SOAP and service description languages. The main change is to the use of
    compact and easily-processed binary encodings of XML data, rather than character
    encodings.<br />\r\nThe use of ISO/IEC 24824-2:2006 (with the ASN.1 SOAP messages
    encoded using the ASN.1 Packed Encoding Rules, PER) allows applications to provide
    Web services using messages that require less network bandwidth and less processing
    power (and hence provide a higher transaction processing rate) than use of the
    character encoding of XML data.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 24824-2:2006 also specifies a
    Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) media type that identifies an ASN.1
    SOAP message encoded in PER. It also specifies a MIME media type that identifies
    a W3C SOAP message infoset encoded as a fast infoset document (see ISO/IEC 24824-1).
    Both of these encodings are used by ISO/IEC 24824-2:2006."
