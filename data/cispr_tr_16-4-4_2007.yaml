abstract:
- content: This Technical Report contains a recommendation on how to deal with statistics
    of radio interference complaints. Furthermore it describes the calculation of
    limits for disturbance field strength and voltage for the measurement on a test
    site based on models for the distribution of disturbances by radiated and conducted
    coupling. This second edition of CISPR 16-4-4 contains two thoroughly updated
    Clauses 4 and 5, compared with its first edition. It also contains, in its new
    Annex A, values of the classical CISPR mains decoupling factor which were determined
    by measurements in real low-voltage AC mains grids in the 1960s.respectively.
