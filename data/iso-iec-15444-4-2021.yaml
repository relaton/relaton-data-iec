    <p>This Recommendation | International Standard specifies the framework, concepts, methodology for testing, and criteria to be achieved to claim compliance to Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 or Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15. It provides a framework for specifying abstract test suites (ATSs) and for defining the procedures to be followed during compliance testing.</p>
    <p>This Recommendation | International Standard:</p>
    <p>‒      specifies compliance testing procedures for encoding and decoding using Rec. ITU-T T.800 | ISO/IEC 15444-1 and Rec. ITU-T T.814 | ISO/IEC 15444-15;</p>
    <p>‒      specifies codestreams, decoded images, and error metrics to be used with the testing procedures;</p>
    <p>‒      specifies ATSs;</p>
    <p>‒      provides guidance for creating an encoder compliance test</p>
    <p>This Recommendation | International Standard does not include the following tests:</p>
    <p>Acceptance testing: the process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance criteria and enables the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation. This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g., functionality, quality, and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation satisfies the user requirements.</p>
    <p>Performance testing: measures the performance characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT) such as its throughput and responsiveness, under various conditions.</p>
    <p>Robustness testing: the process of determining how well an implementation processes data which contains errors.</p>
