  content: IEC PAS 61340-5-6:2022 describe a set of methodologies, techniques, and
    tools that can be used to characterize a process where ESD sensitive (ESDS) items
    are handled. The process assessment covers risks by charged personnel, ungrounded
    conductors, charged ESDS items, and ESDS items in an electrostatic field. This
    document applies to activities that manufacture, process, assemble, install, package,
    label, service, test, inspect, transport, or otherwise handle electrical or electronic
    parts, assemblies, and equipment susceptible to damage by electrostatic discharges.
    This document does not apply to electrically initiated explosive items, flammable
    liquids, or powders. The document does not address program management, compliance
    verification, troubleshooting, or program manager/coordinator certification. In
    this version of the document, risks due to electromagnetic sources that produce
    AC fields are not considered.
