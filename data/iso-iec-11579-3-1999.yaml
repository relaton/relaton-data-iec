    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 11579 specifies a reference configuration (RC) for the extension line of a private integrated</p>
    <p>services network exchange (PINX) including high level functions in addition to the physical termination system</p>
    <p>specified in part 1 of ISO/IEC 11579.</p>
    <p>Since such high level functions appear application dependent and can occur, in principle, in any multiplicity and</p>
    <p>combination, no firm allocation of functional groupings and thus no firm reference points can be indicated. Instead,</p>
    <p>the principles for combining functional groupings associated with the physical termination system and allocating</p>
    <p>reference points are specified in this part of ISO/IEC 11579.</p>
    <p>Examples for some combinations of functional groupings and the allocation of reference points are given in</p>
    <p>annex A.</p>
    <p>The principle is not intended to require any specific implementation of a PINX, but only to provide guidance for the</p>
    <p>specification of PINX capabilities.</p>
    <p>The principle is sufficient to support ISDN-like applications. It can be extended to also support non-ISDN-like</p>
    <p>applications.</p>
