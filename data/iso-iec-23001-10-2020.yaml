  content: "<p>This document defines a storage format for timed metadata. The timed
    metadata can be associated with other tracks in the ISO base media file format.
    Timed metadata such as quality and power consumption information and their metrics
    are defined in this part for carriage in files based on the ISO base media file
    format (ISO/IEC 14496-12). The timed metadata can be used for multiple purposes
    including supporting dynamic adaptive streaming.</p>"
