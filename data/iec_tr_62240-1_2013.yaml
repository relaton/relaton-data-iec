abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 62240-1:2013(E) provides information for the use of semiconductor
    devices in wider temperature ranges than those specified by the device manufacturer.
    The uprating solutions described herein are considered exceptions, when no reasonable
    alternatives are available; otherwise devices are utilized within the manufacturers'
    specifications. This technical report describes the methods and processes for
    implementing this special case. All of the elements of these methods and processes
    employ existing, commonly used best engineering practices. IEC/TR 62240-1 includes
    the following significant changes with respect to IEC/TR 62240:<br />\r\n- revised
    wording, clarifications and corrections;<br />\r\n- removal of all requirements;<br
    />\r\n- updated paragraphs, including addition of references to the utilization
    of samples from a single lot, and the fact that performance of uprating is repeated
    if significant changes are implemented by device manufacturer, as well as the
    reference that the manufacturer's warranty may be eliminated if uprating is performed."
