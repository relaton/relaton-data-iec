abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29121:2009 provides specifications of the data migration method
    for archival data storage which allow manufacturers storage systems that use DVD-R
    (ISO/IEC 23912:2005), DVD-RW (ISO/IEC 17342:2004), DVD-RAM (ISO/IEC 17592:2004),
    +R (ISO/IEC 17344:2006 and ISO/IEC 25434:2007), and +RW (ISO/IEC 17341:2006 and
    ISO/IEC 26925:2006) disks for information storage to classify disk longevity potential
    on the basis of initial performance requirements and to allow users to monitor
    continuing conformance with the error limits required for its class identified
    by the manufacturer of the drive/disk. Digital data can be migrated to a next
    new disk without loss from the present disk as far as the data errors are completely
    corrected before and during the migration and the copy of the data is allowed.The
    methodology for data migration does not apply to disks with short archival storage
    time but to disks with long archival storage time.
