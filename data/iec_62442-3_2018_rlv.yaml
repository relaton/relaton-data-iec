abstract:
- content: IEC 62442-3:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62442-3:2018 defines a measurement
    method for the power losses of electromagnetic transformers as well as the power
    losses and the standby power of electronic convertors for tungsten-halogen lamps
    and for LED light source(s). It is applicable for controlgear that are designed
    for use on DC supplies up to 1 000 V and/or AC supplies up to 1 000 V at 50 Hz
    or 60 Hz. A calculation method of the efficiency of the mentioned controlgear
    for tungsten­halogen lamps and LED light source(s) is also defined. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision and has been harmonized with IEC 62442-1 and
    IEC 62442­2.</p>
