abstract:
- content: "IEC 60068-2-18:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60068-2-18:2017
    provides methods of test applicable to products which, during transportation,
    storage or in service, can be subjected to falling water drops, impacting water,
    immersion or high pressure water impact. The primary purpose of water tests is
    to verify the ability of enclosures, covers and seals to maintain components and
    equipment in good working order after and, when necessary, under a standardized
    drop field or immersion in water.<br />\r\nThese tests are not corrosion tests
    and cannot be considered and used as such.<br />\r\nEstablished water tests in
    other standards are not intended to simulate natural rainfall and their quoted
    intensities are too high to be adopted for that purpose. Therefore, in addition
    to the high-intensity severities, test R includes an artificial rain test based
    upon natural conditions but not taking into account high wind speeds generally
    associated with natural rain.<br />\r\nGuidance is given on the applicability
    of the tests and the severities to be selected.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2000. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. addition of the new
    test method Rb 3."
