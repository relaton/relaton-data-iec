abstract:
- content: "IEC 60287-3-1:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60287-3-1:2017
    is applicable to the conditions of steady-state operation of cables at all voltages,
    buried directly in the ground, in ducts, troughs or in steel pipes, both with
    and without partial drying-out of the soil, as well as cables in air. The term
    \"steady state\" is intended to mean a continuous constant current (100 % load
    factor) just sufficient to produce asymptotically the maximum conductor temperature,
    the surrounding ambient conditions being assumed constant. This document defines
    site reference conditions, however the general values are superseded by specific
    national requirements. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the updated list of national
    laying conditions is now covered in Annex A;<br />\r\n- Clause 5 about the information
    required from the purchaser for the selection of the appropriate type of cable
    has been removed."
