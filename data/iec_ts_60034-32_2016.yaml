abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60034-32:2016(E) is intended to provide consistent guidelines for
    measuring and reporting end-winding vibration behaviour during operation and at
    standstill. It<br />\r\n- defines terms for measuring, analysis and evaluation
    of stator end-winding vibration and related structural dynamics;<br />\r\n- gives
    guidelines for measuring dynamic / structural characteristics offline and stator
    end-winding vibrations online;<br />\r\n- describes instrumentation and installation
    practices for end-winding vibration measurement equipment;<br />\r\n- establishes
    general principles for documentation of test results;<br />\r\n- describes the
    theoretical background of stator end-winding vibrations. This part of IEC 60034
    is applicable to three-phase synchronous generators and three-phase synchronous
    direct online (DOL) motors."
