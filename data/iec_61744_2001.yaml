abstract:
- content: |-
    Defines standard procedures for calibrating optical fibre chromatic dispersion test sets. The procedures apply to calibration laboratories, and to manufacturers and users of CD test sets, for: (a) calibrating CD test sets, (b) setting specifications of CD test sets, (c) extending the calibration period of an already calibrated CD test set.
     It applies to all CD test sets, except for multimode fibres.
