  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19778-2:2008 specifies the Data Model for a collaborative environment.
    The collaborative environment Data Model composes collaborative tools and declares
    their collaborative functions by specifying their names. These names may be used
    as references to collaborative tools and collaborative functions specified in
    detail by further specifications or standards. Where no such specifications or
    standards are available or identified, the provision of descriptions for human
    interpretation may support harmonized use of these names.</p>"
