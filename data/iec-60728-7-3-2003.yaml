  content: specifies requirements for the Hybrid Fibre Coax (HFC) Outside Plant (OSP)
    Power Supplies (PS). This standard is part of a series developed to support the
    design and implementation of interoperable management systems for evolving HFC
    cable networks. The purpose of the standards is to support the design and implementation
    of interoperable management systems for evolving HFC cable networks. The Power
    Supply to Transponder Interface Bus (PSTIB) specification describes the physical
    (PHY) interface and related messaging and protocols implemented at the Data Link
    Layer (DLL), layers 1 and 2 respectively in the 7-layer ISO-OSI reference model,
    that support communications between compliant transponders and the managed OSP
    power supplies and other related power equipment to which they interface.
