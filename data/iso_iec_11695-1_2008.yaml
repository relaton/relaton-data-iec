abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 11695 is one of a series of International Standards defining the
    parameters for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage
    and interchange of digital data. ISO/IEC 11695 is specific to optical memory cards
    using the holographic recording method.ISO/IEC 11695-1:2008 defines the physical
    characteristics of optical memory cards using the holographic recording method.
