abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 focuses on providing a definition of the concepts
    and the relationships that exist among those concepts in an Open-edi business
    transaction. Such a repository of conceptual definitions is termed a domain ontology
    for Open-edi.It addresses the fundamental and definable aspects of a business
    transaction as it unfolds with business partners: first planning their activities,
    then identifying their prospective trading partners, then negotiating commitments
    for economic exchanges, and finally fulfilling those commitments with reciprocated
    transfers of economic resources. The key concepts required for an Open-edi business
    transaction, which are derived from the fields of accounting and economics, are
    defined. ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 provides the ontological specification with an enumeration
    of the primitive and derived data classes needed in a full economic exchange.
    These definitions are specified with class diagrams from the Unified Modelling
    Language (UML). This is the declarative component of the Open-edi Business Transaction
    Ontology (OeBTO).ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 identifies the procedural components of
    the OeBTO: its computable mechanisms for tracking progress through an actual business
    process where partners exchange information with each other as they progress through
    the Open-edi trading phases of planning, identification, negotiation, actualization
    and post-actualization. This progress is determined with specified state machine
    mechanics. ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007 finishes by identifying the constraint component
    of the OeBTO: its repository for business rules and assertions.Cultural adaptability
    and integration with the other parts of ISO/IEC 15944 is provided by supplying
    a list of consolidated French definitions and by enumerating the two classes of
    Open-edi constraints. Theoretical background for the ontological components of
    the OeBTO is provided by enumerating the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology as
    that work is being used in standards work with the United Nations Centre for Trade
    Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). Use of ISO/IEC 15944-4:2007
    (and related standards) will facilitate the integration of these ontological definitions
    into specified, registered and re-useable eBusiness scenarios and scenario components.'
