    <p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) of Type WORM (Write</p>
    <p>Once Read Many) with a capacity of 5,2 Gbytes. Type WORM ODCs use writing effects that are inherently irreversible.</p>
    <p>Written marks cannot be erased and attempted modification of the written marks are detectable.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>_ the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</p>
    <p>_ the environments in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</p>
    <p>_ the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge, so as to provide mechanical interchange ability</p>
    <p>between data processing systems;</p>
    <p>_ the format of the information on the disk, both embossed and user-written, including the physical disposition of the tracks</p>
    <p>and sectors, the error correction codes, the modulation methods used;</p>
    <p>_ the characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;</p>
    <p>_ the recording characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write data onto the disk;</p>
    <p>_ the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file</p>
    <p>structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
