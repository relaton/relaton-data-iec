- content: |-
    Serves as an application guidance and relates to IEC 61967-4. The division of IC types into -> IC function modules and the software modules for -> cores with CPU can be used for Parts 3, 5 and 6 of IEC 61967. Gives advice for performing test methods described in IEC 61967-4 by classifying types of integrated circuits (ICs) and providing hints for test applications related to the IC type classification.

    To obtain comparable results of IC emission measurements using IEC 61967-4, definitions are given which are in addition to the general conditions specified in IEC 61967-1 and IEC 61967-4. These definitions concern IC related operating modes, pins and  ports to be tested, test set-ups according IEC 61967-4, including description of load circuits and RF path, and IC related emission limits (or limit classes). Parts of the guidance provided by this technical report may be applicable to other parts of IEC 61967.
