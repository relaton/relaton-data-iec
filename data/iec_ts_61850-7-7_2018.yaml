abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61850-7-7:2018(E) specifies a way to model the code components of
    IEC 61850 data model (e.g., the tables describing logical nodes, common data classes,
    structured data attributes, and enumerations) in an XML format that can be imported
    and interpreted by tools. The purpose of this document is limited to the publication
    of the XML format which should support the data model part of any IEC 61850 related
    standard.
