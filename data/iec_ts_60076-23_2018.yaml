abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60076-23:2018(E) specifies requirements for devices for the suppression
    of DC magnetic bias of power transformers and convertor transformers. It includes
    requirements for service conditions, structures, testing, packing, transport and
    storage.<br />\r\nThe devices are connected to neutral points of power transformers
    and converter transformers to suppress DC bias current in the case an HVDC system
    is operated in monopole ground return mode or bipolar unbalanced mode. In the
    case of dedicated metallic return HVDC system, the devices are useful to mitigate
    DC stray current flowing through power transformers and converter transformers
    during transient conditions such as DC line fault.<br />\r\nThis document applies
    to DC magnetic bias suppression devices for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz
    and 60 Hz on power systems having voltages above 110 kV."
