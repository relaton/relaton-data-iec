    <p>ISO/IEC 18745-1:2014 provides a set of instructions for prototype evaluation of Machine Readable Passports (MRPs) which may incorporate contactless integrated circuits. Prototype evaluation is an instrument to establish the ability in principle of a specific type of document to fulfil the requirements of use. It supplies a structured approach to evaluate Machine Readable Passports by:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>defining reproducible stress methods to submit the document(s) under evaluation to specific stress or environmental conditions;</li>
    <li>defining reproducible evaluation methods to measure numerical values for specific document properties;</li>
    <li>defining test sequences that specify the order in which stress methods and evaluation methods are to be performed; </li>
    <li>defining test plans to link specific user requirements to test sequences and related parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It specifies the minimum criteria to be achieved in order to meet ICAO's expectations for durability of fully personalized MRPs.</p>
