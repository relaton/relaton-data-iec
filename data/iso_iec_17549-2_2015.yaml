    ISO/IEC 17549-2:2015 gives guidelines on the design of navigation methods for selection menus with use of a 4-direction device. A 4-direction key is an example of a 4-direction device. The guidelines are applicable to any information equipment on which the display area is associated with the 4-direction device.

    ISO/IEC 17549-2:2015 also provides recommendations for parameters for display screen settings, character sets, and languages in use.

    ISO/IEC 17549-2:2015 is not applicable to safety-related uses on menu navigation.
