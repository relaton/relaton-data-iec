abstract:
- content: "IEC 60077-5:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60077-5:2019
    give additional or amended rules for high voltage (HV) fuses as a supplement to
    those given by IEC 60077-2. The high voltage fuses concerned are those connected
    into power and/or auxiliary circuits. The nominal voltage of these circuits lies
    between 600 V DC and 3 000 V DC, according to IEC 60850. These fuses can also
    be used in auxiliary AC circuits up to a nominal voltage of 1 500 V. This document
    together with IEC 60077-2 states specifically:<br />\r\na) the characteristics
    of the fuses;<br />\r\nb) the service conditions with which the fuses comply with
    reference to:<br />\r\n- operation and behaviour in normal service;<br />\r\n-
    operation and behaviour in case of short circuit;<br />\r\n- dielectric properties.<br
    />\r\nc) the tests intended for confirming the compliance of the fuse with the
    characteristics under the service conditions and the methods adopted for these
    tests;<br />\r\nd) the information marked on, or given with, the fuse.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, issued in 2003. This edition
    includes the following main technical changes with regard to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) test method of test duty III for verification of breaking capacity is
    reviewed."
