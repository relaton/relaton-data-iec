    <p>ISO/IEC 14882:2003 specifies requirements for implementations of the C++ programming language and standard library. By implication, it also defines C++ programs and their behavior.</p>
    <p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language based on the C programming language as described in ISO/IEC 9899:1990. In addition to the facilities provided by C, C++ provides additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions, namespaces, inline functions, operator overloading, function-name overloading, references, free-store management operators, and additional library facilities.</p>
