abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 22767:2005 describes how CSTA can be used to provide a subset
    of CSTA call control functionality, called first party call control, for Session
    Initiation Protocol (SIP) user agents. The term uaCSTA (for user agent CSTA) refers
    to transporting ECMA-323 (CSTA XML) messages over a SIP session.</p><p>SIP is
    a control (signalling) protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions
    with one or more participants. These sessions include Internet telephone calls,
    multimedia distribution, and multimedia conferences.</p><p>CSTA standardizes a
    very powerful and flexible set of application services to observe and control
    voice and non-voice media calls as well as control and observe non-call related
    features.</p><p>uaCSTA leverages SIP mechanisms to provide a highly featured,
    robust, and extensible set of features to support applications in the Enterprise
    environment.</p><p>uaCSTA can be implemented by several different types of SIP
    user agents:</p><ul><li>directly by a SIP user agent on a SIP phone,</li><li>uaCSTA
    can also be implemented by a SIP B2BUA to augment 3PCC functionality, and</li><li>by
    a proxy server that is front-ending a PBX.</li></ul>"
