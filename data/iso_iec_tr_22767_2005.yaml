abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 22767:2005 describes how CSTA can be used to provide a subset of CSTA call
    control functionality, called first party call control, for Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) user agents. The term uaCSTA (for user agent CSTA) refers to transporting
    ECMA-323 (CSTA XML) messages over a SIP session.<br />\r\nSIP is a control (signalling)
    protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating sessions with one or more participants.
    These sessions include Internet telephone calls, multimedia distribution, and
    multimedia conferences.<br />\r\nCSTA standardizes a very powerful and flexible
    set of application services to observe and control voice and non-voice media calls
    as well as control and observe non-call related features.<br />\r\nuaCSTA leverages
    SIP mechanisms to provide a highly featured, robust, and extensible set of features
    to support applications in the Enterprise environment.<br />\r\nuaCSTA can be
    implemented by several different types of SIP user agents:<br />\r\ndirectly by
    a SIP user agent on a SIP phone,<br />\r\nuaCSTA can also be implemented by a
    SIP B2BUA to augment 3PCC functionality, and<br />\r\nby a proxy server that is
    front-ending a PBX."
