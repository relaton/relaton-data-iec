abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies provision of connectionless user data confidentiality,
    frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity by media access independent
    protocols and entities that operate transparently to MAC Clients.</p><p>NOTE—The
    MAC Clients are as specified in IEEE Std 802®, IEEE Std 802.1Q?, and IEEE Std
    802.1X.2</p><p>To this end, it</p><p>a) Specifies the requirements to be satisfied
    by equipment claiming conformance to this standard.</p><p>b) Specifies the requirements
    for MACsec in terms of provision of the MAC Service and the</p><p>preservation
    of the semantics and parameters of service requests and indications.</p><p>c)
    Describes the threats, both intentional and accidental, to correct provision of
    the service.</p><p>d) Specifies security services that prevent, or restrict, the
    effect of attacks that exploit these threats.</p><p>e) Examines the potential
    impact of both the threats and the use of MACsec on the Quality of Service</p><p>(QoS),
    specifying constraints on the design and operation of MAC Security entities and
    protocols.</p><p>f) Models support of the secure MAC Service in terms of the operation
    of media access control method</p><p>independent MAC Security Entities (SecYs)
    within the MAC Sublayer.</p><p>g) Specifies the format of the MACsec Protocol
    Data Unit (MPDUs) used to provide secure service.</p><p>h) Identifies the functions
    to be performed by each SecY, and provides an architectural model of its</p><p>internal
    operation in terms of Processes and Entities that provide those functions.</p><p>i)
    Specifies each SecY's use of an associated and collocated Port Access Entity (PAE,</p><p>IEEE
    Std 802.1X) to discover and authenticate MACsec protocol peers and its use of
    that PAE's</p><p>Key Agreement Entity (KaY) to agree and update cryptographic
    keys.</p><p>j) Specifies performance requirements and recommends default values
    and applicable ranges for the</p><p>operational parameters of a SecY.</p><p>k)
    Specifies how SecYs are incorporated within the architecture of end stations,
    bridges, and two-port</p><p>Ethernet Data Encryption devices (EDEs).</p><p>l)
    Establishes the requirements for management of MAC Security, identifying the managed
    objects</p><p>and defining the management operations for SecYs.</p><p>m) Specifies
    the Management Information Base (MIB) module for managing the operation of MAC</p><p>Security
    in TCP/IP networks.</p><p>n) Specifies requirements, criteria, and choices of
    Cipher Suites for use with this standard.</p>"
