abstract:
- content: "This document specifies provision of connectionless user data confidentiality,
    frame data integrity, and data origin authenticity by media access independent
    protocols and entities that operate transparently to MAC Clients.<br />\r\nNOTE
    - The MAC Clients are as specified in IEEE Std 802Â®, IEEE Std 802.1Q?, and IEEE
    Std 802.1X.2.<br />\r\nTo this end, it<br />\r\na) Specifies the requirements
    to be satisfied by equipment claiming conformance to this standard.<br />\r\nb)
    Specifies the requirements for MACsec in terms of provision of the MAC Service
    and the preservation of the semantics and parameters of service requests and indications.<br
    />\r\nc) Describes the threats, both intentional and accidental, to correct provision
    of the service.<br />\r\nd) Specifies security services that prevent, or restrict,
    the effect of attacks that exploit these threats.<br />\r\ne) Examines the potential
    impact of both the threats and the use of MACsec on the Quality of Service (QoS),
    specifying constraints on the design and operation of MAC Security entities and
    protocols.<br />\r\nf) Models support of the secure MAC Service in terms of the
    operation of media access control method independent MAC Security Entities (SecYs)
    within the MAC Sublayer.<br />\r\ng) Specifies the format of the MACsec Protocol
    Data Unit (MPDUs) used to provide secure service.<br />\r\nh) Identifies the functions
    to be performed by each SecY, and provides an architectural model of its internal
    operation in terms of Processes and Entities that provide those functions.<br
    />\r\ni) Specifies each SecY's use of an associated and collocated Port Access
    Entity (PAE, IEEE Std 802.1X) to discover and authenticate MACsec protocol peers
    and its use of that PAE's Key Agreement Entity (KaY) to agree and update cryptographic
    keys.<br />\r\nj) Specifies performance requirements and recommends default values
    and applicable ranges for the operational parameters of a SecY.<br />\r\nk) Specifies
    how SecYs are incorporated within the architecture of end stations, bridges, and
    two-port Ethernet Data Encryption devices (EDEs).<br />\r\nl) Establishes the
    requirements for management of MAC Security, identifying the managed objects and
    defining the management operations for SecYs.<br />\r\nm) Specifies the Management
    Information Base (MIB) module for managing the operation of MAC Security in TCP/IP
    networks.<br />\r\nn) Specifies requirements, criteria, and choices of Cipher
    Suites for use with this standard."
