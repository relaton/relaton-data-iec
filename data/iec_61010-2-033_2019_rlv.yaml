abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-033:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61010-2-033:2019 specifies
    safety requirements for hand-held multimeters for domestic and professional use,
    capable of measuring mains. Hand-held multimeters are multi-range multifunction
    measuring instruments intended to measure voltage and other electrical quantities
    such as resistance or current. Their primary purpose is to measure voltage on
    a live mains. They are suitable to be supported by one hand during normal use.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    The scope has been reduced to hand-held multimeters. Voltmeters and clamp multimeters
    have been removed. They are addressed respectively by IEC 61010-2-030 and IEC
    61010-2-032. The relevant definitions have been removed.<br />\r\n- Subclause
    4.4.2.101 has been relocated into Clause 102.<br />\r\n- Clearances and creepage
    distances for wet locations and for measuring circuit terminals exceeding 1 000
    V a.c. or 1 414 V d.c. have been specified.<br />\r\n- Subclause 14.101 related
    to \"Circuits or components used as transient overvoltage limiting devices in
    measuring circuits used to measure mains\" has been removed.<br />\r\n- References
    to IEC 61010-031 for probe assemblies and IEC 61010-2-032 for current sensors
    have been added.<br />\r\n- Requirements for protection against mains overvoltage
    measuring circuits have been added.<br />\r\n- Clause 102 has been rewritten.<br
    />\r\n- Requirements for measuring circuits from 1 000 V to 3 000 V have been
    added.<br />\r\n- An informative Annex CC about dimensions of 4-mm banana terminals
    has been added.<br />\r\n- A flowchart for insulation according to the type of
    circuit has been added in a new Annex DD.</p>"
