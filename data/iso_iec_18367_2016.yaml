abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18367:2016 gives guidelines for cryptographic algorithms and security
    mechanisms conformance testing methods.<p>Conformance testing assures that an
    implementation of a cryptographic algorithm or security mechanism is correct whether
    implemented in hardware, software or firmware. It also confirms that it runs correctly
    in a specific operating environment. Testing can consist of known-answer or Monte
    Carlo testing, or a combination of test methods. Testing can be performed on the
    actual implementation or modelled in a simulation environment.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18367:2016
    does not include the efficiency of the algorithms or security mechanisms nor the
    intrinsic performance. This document focuses on the correctness of the implementation.</p>
