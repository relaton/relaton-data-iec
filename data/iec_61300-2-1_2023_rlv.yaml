abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-2-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-2-1:2023
    evaluates the effects of vibration on fibre optic devices at the predominant frequency
    ranges and magnitudes that are encountered during field service on attenuation.
    NOTE Most vibrations encountered in service are not of a simple harmonic nature.
    However, it has been shown that tests based on vibrations of this type are satisfactory
    to simulating actual service. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third
    edition published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical change with respect to the
    previous edition: harmonizing with the test conditions in IEC 61753-1:2018 and
    revising severities."
