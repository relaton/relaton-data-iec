abstract:
- content: 'This technical report has been developed to facilitate the production,
    supply and use of semiconductor die products, including: wafers, singulated bare
    die, die and wafers attached connection structures and minimally or partially
    encapsulated die and wafers. This report contains an XML schema that describes
    the elements needed for data exchange and that will allow the implementation of
    the requirements of IEC 62258-1, IEC 62258-5 and IEC 62258-6, as well as providing
    an exchange structure that is complementary to those defined in IEC 62258-2. It
    is also complementary to and compatible with the questionnaire in IEC/TR 62258-4.'
