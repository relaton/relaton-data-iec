abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594 has been produced to facilitate the interconnection of
    information processing systems to provide directory services. A set of such systems,
    together with the directory information that they hold, can be viewed as an integrated
    whole, called the Directory. The information held by the Directory, collectively
    known as the Directory Information Base (DIB), is typically used to facilitate
    communication between, with or about objects such as application entities, people,
    terminals and distribution lists.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9594-5:2014 specifies the application
    service elements and application contexts for two protocols? the Directory Access
    Protocol (DAP) and the Directory System Protocol (DSP). The DAP provides for access
    to the Directory to retrieve or modify Directory information. The DSP provides
    for the chaining of requests to retrieve or modify Directory information to other
    parts of the distributed Directory System where the information may be held.</p><p>In
    addition, ISO/IEC 9594-5:2014 specifies the application service elements and application
    contexts for the Directory Information Shadowing Protocol (DISP) and the Directory
    Operational Binding Management Protocol (DOP). The DISP provides for the shadowing
    of information held in one Directory System Agent (DSA) to another DSA. The DOP
    provides for the establishment, modification and termination of bindings between
    pairs of DSAs for the administration of relationships between the DSAs (such as
    for shadowing or hierarchical relationships).</p>"
