abstract:
- content: "IEC 62680-4-1:2022 provides Universal Serial Bus 4™ Specification.<br
    />\r\nUSB 3.1 and USB 3.2 were evolutionary steps to increase bandwidth. The goal
    for USB4 remains the same with the added goal of helping to converge the USB Type-C®
    connector ecosystem and minimize end-user confusion. Several key design areas
    to meet this goal are listed below:<br />\r\n• Offer display, data, and load/store
    functionality over a single USB Type-C connector.<br />\r\n• Retain compatibility
    with existing ecosystem of USB and Thunderbolt™ products.<br />\r\n• Define Port
    Capabilities for predictable and consistent user experience.<br />\r\n• Provide
    increased host flexibility to configure bandwidth, power management, and other
    performance-related parameters for system needs<br />\r\nThis document contains
    USB4™ Specification, Version 1.0 with Errata and ECN through May 19, 2021."
