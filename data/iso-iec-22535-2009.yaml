    <p>ISO/IEC 22535:2009 specifies tunnelling of "QSIG" over the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) within a corporate telecommunication network (CN).</p>
    <p>The tunnelling of QSIG through a public IP network employing SIP is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 22535:2009. However, the functionality specified in this International Standard is in principle applicable to such a scenario when deployed in conjunction with other relevant functionality (e.g. address translation, security functions, etc.).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 22535:2009 is applicable to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP, with QSIG tunnelled within SIP requests and responses.</p>
