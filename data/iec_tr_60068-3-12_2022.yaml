abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60068-3-12:2022(E) which is a Technical Report, describes the creation
    of temperature-time profiles (in specific envelope profiles) for reflow soldering
    of electronic assemblies, considering tolerances resulting from the accuracy of
    the measuring equipment, preparation method and specifications of the manufacturers
    of components, circuit boards, solder paste, etc.).<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\na)
    Extended purpose\r\nGuidance is added on how to create a reflow profile considering
    the tolerances resulting from the accuracy of the measuring equipment, preparation
    method and specifications of the component manufacturers (components, PCB, solder
    paste, etc.).\r\n\r\nb) Distinction from existing standards\r\nThe envelope profile
    given in this document does not represent a temperature-time profile for the qualification
    of materials but defines the reflow process limits for the soldering of electronic
    assemblies.<br />\r\nThe schematic temperature-time-limit curves of the envelope
    profile are derived from generally valid findings (literature data). Additionally,
    tolerance considerations are given for all envelope points of the envelope profile.<br
    />\r\nIn contrast to IEC TR 60068-3-12:2014, the creation of the envelope profile
    is not primarily linked to a concrete example.\r\nc) Subclause 8.2 presents an
    approach for establishing a possible temperature profile for a lead-free reflow
    soldering process using SnAgCu solder paste that is taken from IEC TR 60068-3-12:2014.\r\n\r\nd)
    Synergies with existing standards\r\nLimit values and tolerances from standards
    and guidelines for the qualification of materials are included in this document
    and are listed as examples in the references."
