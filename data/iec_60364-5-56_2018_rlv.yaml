abstract:
- content: "IEC 60364-5-56:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\nIEC 60364-5-56:2018
    covers general requirements for safety services, selection and erection of electrical
    supply systems for safety services and electrical safety sources. Standby electrical
    supply systems are outside the scope of this part. This part does not apply to
    installations in hazardous areas (BE3), for which requirements are given in IEC
    60079-14. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n1) Modifications to normative references and terms and definitions.<br />\r\n2)
    Under electrical circuits for safety services, addition of requirements concerning
    circuit and overcurrent protection in order to maintain reliability of safety
    service power supplies under fire conditions.<br />\r\n3) Under electrical circuits
    for safety services, addition of requirements stating that circuits for safety
    services are not to be protected by RCDs or AFDDs.<br />\r\n4) Under emergency
    lighting applications, addition of requirements to prevent emergency lighting
    systems being adversely affected by any control system.<br />\r\n5) Addition of
    requirements for all emergency luminaires in the area to provide full design light
    output in the event of any final circuit failure.<br />\r\n6) Addition of a new
    Annex D (informative): Fire switch.<br />\r\n7) Addition of a new Annex E (informative):
    Example of installation methods of safety services with cable management system.<br
    />\r\n8) Addition of a new Annex F (informative): Wiring systems.<br />\r\n9)
    Addition of a new Annex G (informative): Guidance on suitable locations for electrical
    sources for safety services."
