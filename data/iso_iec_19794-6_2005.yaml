abstract:
- content: "This edition of the standard exceptionally remains valid until 2033.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 19794-6:2005 specifies two alternative image interchange formats
    for biometric authentication systems that utilize iris recognition.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    first is based on a rectilinear image storage format that may be a raw, uncompressed
    array of intensity values or a compressed format such as that specified by ISO/IEC
    15444.<br /><br />\r\nThe second format is based on a polar image specification
    that requires certain pre-processing and image segmentation steps, but produces
    a much more compact data structure that contains only iris information.<br /><br
    />\r\nData that comply with either one of the iris image formats specified in
    ISO/IEC 19794-6:2005 are intended to be embedded in a CBEFF-compliant structure
    in the CBEFF Biometric Data Block (BDB) as specified in ISO/IEC 19785-1."
