  content: IEC/TS 62548:2013(E) sets out design requirements for photovoltaic (PV)
    arrays including d.c. array wiring, electrical protection devices, switching and
    earthing provisions. The scope includes all parts of the PV array up to but not
    including energy storage devices, power conversion equipment or loads. The object
    of this Technical Specification is to address the design safety requirements arising
    from the particular characteristics of photovoltaic systems. Attention is drawn
    to a project in the IEC 60364 series under joint development between IEC TCs 64
    and 82, which will, when published, cancel and replace the present technical specification.
