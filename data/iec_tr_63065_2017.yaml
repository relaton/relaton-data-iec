abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63065:2017(E) provides general guidance on basic principles and
    general proposals for the safe and economic operation and maintenance of an LCC
    converter station.<br />\r\nThese guidelines are based on the operation and maintenance
    practices that have been used successfully during the last decades at HVDC converter
    stations all over the world, and can be referred to by new HVDC users to optimize
    operation and maintenance policy and assist in performing the operation and maintenance
    work.<br />\r\nThis document focuses only on the operation and maintenance of
    the equipment inside an LCC converter station, including back-to-back HVDC systems.
    The operation and maintenance of HVDC overhead transmission lines, HVDC cables
    and voltage sourced converter (VSC) are not covered by this document."
