abstract:
- content: "This document specifies conformance tests in the form of an abstract test
    suite (ATS) for a system under test (SUT) that implements an electric-vehicle
    communication controller (EVCC) or a supply-equipment communication controller
    (SECC) for all common requirements specified in ISO 15118-20 that are independent
    of a particular charging type (AC, DC, ACD, WPT charging). These conformance tests
    specify the testing of capabilities and behaviours of an SUT, as well as checking
    what is observed against the conformance requirements specified in ISO 15118-20
    and against what the implementer states the SUT implementation's capabilities
    are.<br />\r\nThe capability tests within the ATS check that the observable capabilities
    of the SUT are in accordance with the static conformance requirements specified
    in ISO 15118-20. The behaviour tests of the ATS examine an implementation as thoroughly
    as practical over the full range of dynamic conformance requirements specified
    in ISO 15118-20 and within the capabilities of the SUT.<br />\r\nA test architecture
    is described in correspondence to the ATS. The abstract test cases in this document
    are described leveraging this test architecture and are specified in descriptive
    tabular format covering the ISO/OSI layer 3 to 7 (network to application layers).<br
    />\r\nIn terms of coverage, this document only covers normative sections and requirements
    in ISO 15118-20. This document additionally refers to specific tests for requirements
    on referenced standards (e.g. IETF RFCs, W3C Recommendation, etc.) if they are
    relevant in terms of conformance for implementations according to ISO 15118-20.
    However, it is explicitly not intended to widen the scope of this conformance
    specification to such external standards, if it is not technically necessary for
    the purpose of conformance testing for ISO 15118-20. Furthermore, the conformance
    tests specified in this document do not include the assessment of performance
    nor robustness or reliability of an implementation. They cannot provide judgments
    on the physical realization of abstract service primitives, how a system is implemented,
    how it provides any requested service, or the environment of the protocol implementation.
    Furthermore, the abstract test cases specified in this document only consider
    the communication protocol and the system's behaviour specified in ISO 15118-20.
    Power flow between the EVSE and the EV is no prerequisite for the test cases specified
    in this document."
