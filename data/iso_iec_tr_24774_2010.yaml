abstract:
- content: 'An increasing number of international, national and industry standards
    describe process models. These models are developed for a range of purposes including
    process implementation and assessment. The terms and descriptions used in such
    models vary in format, content and level of prescription. ISO/IEC TR 24774:2010
    presents guidelines for the elements used most frequently in describing a process:
    the title, purpose, outcomes, activities, task and information item. Whilst the
    primary purpose of ISO/IEC TR 24774:2010 is to encourage consistency in standard
    process reference models, the guidelines it provides can be applied to any process
    model developed for any purpose.'
