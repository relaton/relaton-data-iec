abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9796-2:2002 specifies three digital signature schemes giving
    message recovery, two of which are deterministic (non-randomized) and one of which
    is randomized. The security of all three schemes is based on the difficulty of
    factorizing large numbers. All three schemes can provide either total or partial
    message recovery.</p><p>The method for key production for the three signature
    schemes is specified in this part of ISO/IEC 9796. However, techniques for key
    management and for random number generation (as required for the randomized signature
    scheme), are outside the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 9796.</p><p>Users of this
    International Standard are, wherever possible, recommended to adopt the second
    mechanism (Digital signature scheme 2). However, in environments where generation
    of random variables by the signer is deemed infeasible, then Digital signature
    scheme 3 is recommended. Digital signature scheme 1 shall only be used in environments
    where compatibility is required with systems implementing the first edition of
    this International Standard. However, Digital signature scheme 1 is only compatible
    with systems implementing the first edition of this International Standard that
    use hash-codes of at least 160 bits.</p>"
