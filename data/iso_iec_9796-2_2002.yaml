abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9796-2:2002 specifies three digital signature schemes giving message
    recovery, two of which are deterministic (non-randomized) and one of which is
    randomized. The security of all three schemes is based on the difficulty of factorizing
    large numbers. All three schemes can provide either total or partial message recovery.The
    method for key production for the three signature schemes is specified in this
    part of ISO/IEC 9796. However, techniques for key management and for random number
    generation (as required for the randomized signature scheme), are outside the
    scope of this part of ISO/IEC 9796.Users of this International Standard are, wherever
    possible, recommended to adopt the second mechanism (Digital signature scheme
    2). However, in environments where generation of random variables by the signer
    is deemed infeasible, then Digital signature scheme 3 is recommended. Digital
    signature scheme 1 shall only be used in environments where compatibility is required
    with systems implementing the first edition of this International Standard. However,
    Digital signature scheme 1 is only compatible with systems implementing the first
    edition of this International Standard that use hash-codes of at least 160 bits.
