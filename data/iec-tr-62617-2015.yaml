  content: "IEC TR 62617:2015(E) applies to uncertainty reporting of measurements
    of home laundry electrical appliances. It allows to estimate the uncertainty of
    a measured result and to predict the range of values that may be measured when
    the same appliance is measured in another laboratory following the same measurement
    method. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- alternative expression of expanded
    uncertainties in absolute values;<br />\r\n- expanded uncertainty for horizontal
    drum washing machines according to IEC 60456:2010;<br />\r\n- expanded uncertainties
    for washer-dryer according to IEC 62512:2012;<br />\r\n- clarifications of the
    examples of expanded uncertainty calculation."
