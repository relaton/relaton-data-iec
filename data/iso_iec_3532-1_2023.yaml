abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 3532-1:2023 This document specifies the requirements for medical
    image-based modelling for 3D printing for medical applications. It concerns accurate
    3D data modelling in the medical field using medical image data generated from
    computed tomography (CT) devices. It also specifies the principal considerations
    for the general procedures of medical image-based modelling. It excludes soft
    tissue modelling from magnetic resonance image (MRI).
