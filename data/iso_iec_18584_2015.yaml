abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO 18584:2015 establishes</p><p>- conformance test requirements for
    using general framework for on-card comparison applications,</p><p>- conformance
    test requirements for using work-sharing mechanism for on-card comparison applications,
    and</p><p>- conformance test requirements to check accomplishment of security
    policies for on-card biometric comparison that are specified in ISO/IEC 24787:2010.</p><p>ISO
    18584:2015 only covers the testing of APDU command and response pairs involved
    for the ICC that has the capability to perform on-card biometric comparison based
    on ISO/IEC 24787:2010.</p><p>Measuring the performance of on-card biometric comparison
    algorithms in terms of error rates is not within the scope of this International
    Standard.</p>"
