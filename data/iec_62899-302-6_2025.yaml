abstract:
- content: 'IEC 62899-302-6:2025 specifies the method for determining inkjet first
    drop behaviour based on either visualized droplet images or printed dots on standard
    substrate. The exact behaviour that is referenced in this document is as follows:
    jetting speed variation according to the drop numbers, including non-jetting and
    low jetting speed. This measurement standardization is limited to drop-on-demand
    type of inkjet including piezo and thermal types and is not applicable to continuous
    inkjet. This document includes the test equipment, printing procedures, and analysis
    of drop behaviour. This document is limited to printed electronics application
    and is not suitable for graphic or other applications.'
