abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 23005-2:2016 specifies syntax and semantics of the tools required
    to provide interoperability in controlling devices in real as well as virtual
    worlds. In Figure 1, the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 23005 with tools defined
    in this part of ISO/IEC 23005 is shown. The adaptation engine (RV or VR engine),
    which is not within the scope of standardization, takes six inputs [sensory effects
    (SE), user's sensory effect preferences (USEP), sensory devices capabilities (SDC),
    sensor capability (SC), sensor adaptation preferences (SAP), and sensed information
    (SI)] and outputs sensory devices commands (SDCmd) and/or sensed information (SI)
    to control the devices in real world or virtual world objects. It is applicable
    to the interfaces between the adaptation engine and the capability descriptions
    of actuators/sensors in the real world, the user's sensory preference information,
    which characterize devices and users, and the sensor adaptation preferences information,
    which characterize sensors and users, so that appropriate information to control
    devices (actuators and sensors) can be generated. In other words, user's sensory
    preferences, sensory device capabilities, sensor adaptation preferences, and sensor
    capabilities are within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 23005.
