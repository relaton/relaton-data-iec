abstract:
- content: "IEC 62541-6:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62541-6:2020 specifies
    the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) mapping between the security model described
    in IEC TR 62541-2, the abstract service definitions specified in IEC 62541-4,
    the data structures defined in IEC 62541-5 and the physical network protocols
    that can be used to implement the OPC UA specification. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Encodings:<br />\r\n•
    added JSON encoding for PubSub (non-reversible);<br />\r\n• added JSON encoding
    for Client/Server (reversible);<br />\r\n• added support for optional fields in
    structures;<br />\r\n• added support for Unions.<br />\r\nb) Transport mappings:<br
    />\r\n• added WebSocket secure connection – WSS;<br />\r\n• added support for
    reverse connectivity;<br />\r\n• added support for session-less service invocation
