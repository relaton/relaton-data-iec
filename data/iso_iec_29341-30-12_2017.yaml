abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341 This part of Publicly Available Specification specifies the characteristics
    of a networked service that offers sensor and/or actuator data transport capabilities
    to an independent networked entity known as a control point.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-30-12:2017 defines the service SensorTransportGeneric:1 (in short TransportGeneric),
    which identifies Level 1 of the UPnP IoT Management and Control TransportGeneric:1
    Service [10]. This Publicly Available Specification is applicable to Standardized
    DCPs of the UPnP Forum which include this service.<br />\r\nThis service enables
    UPnP clients to access sensors and/or actuators without needing a detailed knowledge
    of the target sensor or actuator or its connectivity to the UPnP network. Sensors
    and Actuators are instead treated a generic data sources or sinks.<br />\r\nThis
    service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0
    [1]. It defines a service type referred to herein as TransportGeneric service."
