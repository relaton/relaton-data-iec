abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of Publicly Available Specification ISO/IEC 29341 specifies
    the characteristics of a networked service that offers sensor and/or actuator
    data transport capabilities to an independent networked entity known as a control
    point.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29341-30-12:2017 defines the service SensorTransportGeneric:1
    (in short TransportGeneric), which identifies Level 1 of the UPnP IoT Management
    and Control TransportGeneric:1 Service [10]. This Publicly Available Specification
    is applicable to Standardized DCPs of the UPnP Forum which include this service.</p><p>This
    service enables UPnP clients to access sensors and/or actuators without needing
    a detailed knowledge of the target sensor or actuator or its connectivity to the
    UPnP network. Sensors and Actuators are instead treated a generic data sources
    or sinks.</p><p>This service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [1]. It defines a service type referred to herein as TransportGeneric
    service.</p>"
