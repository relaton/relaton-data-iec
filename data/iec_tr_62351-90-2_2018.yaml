abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62351-90-2:2018, which is a technical report, addresses the need
    to perform Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) on communication channels secured by IEC
    62351. The main focus is the illustration of the state-of-the art of DPI techniques
    that can be applied to the various kinds of channels, highlighting the possible
    security risks and implementation costs. Additional, beyond state-of-the-art proposals
    are also described in order to circumvent the main limits of existing solutions.<br
    />\r\nIt is to be noted that some communications secured by IEC 62351 are not
    encrypted, but only add integrity and non-repudiation of the message â€“ however
    they are mentioned here for the sake of completeness around IEC 62351 and DPI"
