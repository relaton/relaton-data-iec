    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21410:2001 This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between
    \"QSIG\" and \"H.323\" in support of the call transfer supplementary services
    within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).<br />\r\n\"QSIG\" is a signalling
    protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services
    eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Q reference
    point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides circuit-switched basic services
    and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other Standards,
    in particular ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic services), ISO/IEC
    11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services)
    and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services. ISO/IEC
    13869 specifies the QSIG protocol in support of call transfer by consultation
    and ISO/IEC 19460 specifies the QSIG protocol in support of single step call transfer.<br
    />\r\n\"H.323\" is a set of signalling protocols for the support of voice or multimedia
    communication within a packet network, in particular a packet network that uses
    the Internet Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol (IP network). H.323 signalling
    protocols operate between endpoints in an IP network, either indirectly via one
    or more gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint can be a terminal or a gateway to
    another network. H.323 is an \"umbrella\" recommendation referring to various
    ITU-T recommendations, in particular Recommendations H.225.0 and H.245 (basic
    communication capabilities) and Recommendation H.450.1 (generic functional protocol
    for the support of supplementary services). Recommendation H.450.2 specifies the
    H.323 protocol in support of call transfer.<br />\r\nNOTE - H.450.2 applies only
    to the 1998 version of H.323 (also known as H.323 version 2) and to later versions.<br
    />\r\nCall transfer by consultation, as supported by ISO/IEC 13869, is a supplementary
    service that enables a user (user A) to transform two of that user's calls (at
    least one of which must be answered) into a new call between the two other users
    in the two calls (users B and C).<br />\r\nSingle step call transfer, as supported
    by ISO/IEC 19460, is a supplementary service that enables a user (user A) to transform
    an existing call between user A and user B into a new call between user B and
    user C without user A needing to establish a call with user C prior to transfer.<br
    />\r\nCall transfer, as supported by H.450.2, is a supplementary service that
    enables the served user (user A) to transform an existing call with a second user
    (user B) into a new call between user B and a third user (user C) selected by
    user A. User A may or may not have a call established with user C prior to call
    transfer. If a call is already established between user A and user C, this is
    known as transfer by consultation and is equivalent to call transfer as supported
    by ISO/IEC 13869. If a call is not already established between user A and user
    C, this is known as single step call transfer and is equivalent to call transfer
    as supported by ISO/IEC 19460.<br />\r\nInterworking between QSIG and H.323 permits
    a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user of an IP network,
    or a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate at a user of a PISN.
    This International Standard provides the following<br />\r\nadditional capabilities:<br
    />\r\n- a PISN user with two calls established, at least one of which being to
    or from a user in an IP network, to be able to transform those two calls into
    a new call between the other two users involved;<br />\r\n- a PISN user with a
    call established to or from a user in an IP network to be able to transform that
    call into a new call between the IP network user and a third user selected by
    the PISN user, that third user being either in the IP network or in the PISN;<br
    />\r\n- a PISN user with a call established to a second PISN user to be able to
    transfer that call into a new call between the second user and a third user selected
    by the first user, that third user being in an IP network;<br />\r\n- an IP network
    user with two calls established, at least one of which being to or from a user
    in a PISN, to be able to transform those two calls into a new call between the
    other two users involved;<br />\r\n- an IP network user with a call established
    to or from a user in a PISN to be able to transform that call into a new call
    between the PISN user and a third user selected by the IP network user, that third
    user being either in the IP network or in the PISN; and<br />\r\nISO/IEC 21410:2001(E)<br
    />\r\n- an IP network user with a call established to a second user in the IP
    network to be able to transfer that call into a new call<br />\r\nbetween the
    second user and a third user selected by the first user, that third user being
    in a PISN.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is applicable to any interworking
    unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG and an IP network
    employing H.323."
