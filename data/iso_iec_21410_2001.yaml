abstract:
- content: <p>This International Standard specifies signalling interworking between
    "QSIG" and "H.323" in support of the call transfer</p><p>supplementary services
    within a Corporate telecommunication Network (CN).</p><p>"QSIG" is a signalling
    protocol that operates at the Q reference point between Private Integrated Services
    eXchanges (PINX)</p><p>within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The
    Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. A PISN provides</p><p>circuit-switched
    basic services and supplementary services to its users. QSIG is specified in other
    Standards, in particular</p><p>ISO/IEC 11572 (call control in support of basic
    services), ISO/IEC 11582 (generic functional protocol for the support of</p><p>supplementary
    services) and a number of standards specifying individual supplementary services.
    ISO/IEC 13869 specifies the</p><p>QSIG protocol in support of call transfer by
    consultation and ISO/IEC 19460 specifies the QSIG protocol in support of single</p><p>step
    call transfer.</p><p>"H.323" is a set of signalling protocols for the support
    of voice or multimedia communication within a packet network, in</p><p>particular
    a packet network that uses the Internet Protocol (IP) as its network layer protocol
    (IP network). H.323 signalling</p><p>protocols operate between endpoints in an
    IP network, either indirectly via one or more gatekeepers, or directly. An endpoint</p><p>can
    be a terminal or a gateway to another network. H.323 is an "umbrella" recommendation
    referring to various ITU-T</p><p>recommendations, in particular Recommendations
    H.225.0 and H.245 (basic communication capabilities) and</p><p>Recommendation
    H.450.1 (generic functional protocol for the support of supplementary services).
    Recommendation H.450.2</p><p>specifies the H.323 protocol in support of call transfer.</p><p>NOTE
    - H.450.2 applies only to the 1998 version of H.323 (also known as H.323 version
    2) and to later versions.</p><p>Call transfer by consultation, as supported by
    ISO/IEC 13869, is a supplementary service that enables a user (user A) to</p><p>transform
    two of that user's calls (at least one of which must be answered) into a new call
    between the two other users in the two</p><p>calls (users B and C).</p><p>Single
    step call transfer, as supported by ISO/IEC 19460, is a supplementary service
    that enables a user (user A) to transform</p><p>an existing call between user
    A and user B into a new call between user B and user C without user A needing
    to establish a call</p><p>with user C prior to transfer.</p><p>Call transfer,
    as supported by H.450.2, is a supplementary service that enables the served user
    (user A) to transform an existing</p><p>call with a second user (user B) into
    a new call between user B and a third user (user C) selected by user A. User A
    may or may</p><p>not have a call established with user C prior to call transfer.
    If a call is already established between user A and user C, this is</p><p>known
    as transfer by consultation and is equivalent to call transfer as supported by
    ISO/IEC 13869. If a call is not already</p><p>established between user A and user
    C, this is known as single step call transfer and is equivalent to call transfer
    as supported</p><p>by ISO/IEC 19460.</p><p>Interworking between QSIG and H.323
    permits a call originating at a user of a PISN to terminate at a user of an IP
    network, or</p><p>a call originating at a user of an IP network to terminate at
    a user of a PISN. This International Standard provides the following</p><p>additional
    capabilities:</p><p>_ a PISN user with two calls established, at least one of
    which being to or from a user in an IP network, to be able to</p><p>transform
    those two calls into a new call between the other two users involved;</p><p>_
    a PISN user with a call established to or from a user in an IP network to be able
    to transform that call into a new call</p><p>between the IP network user and a
    third user selected by the PISN user, that third user being either in the IP network
    or in</p><p>the PISN;</p><p>_ a PISN user with a call established to a second
    PISN user to be able to transfer that call into a new call between the second</p><p>user
    and a third user selected by the first user, that third user being in an IP network;</p><p>_
    an IP network user with two calls established, at least one of which being to
    or from a user in a PISN, to be able to</p><p>transform those two calls into a
    new call between the other two users involved;</p><p>_ an IP network user with
    a call established to or from a user in a PISN to be able to transform that call
    into a new call</p><p>between the PISN user and a third user selected by the IP
    network user, that third user being either in the IP network or in</p><p>the PISN;
    and</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 21410:2001(E)</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong>© ISO/IEC
    2001? All rights reserved</p><p>_ an IP network user with a call established to
    a second user in the IP network to be able to transfer that call into a new call</p><p>between
    the second user and a third user selected by the first user, that third user being
    in a PISN.</p><p>This International Standard is applicable to any interworking
    unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG</p><p>and an IP network
    employing H.323.</p>
