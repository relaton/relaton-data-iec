abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a unified speech and audio codec which is capable
    of coding signals having an arbitrary mix of speech and audio content. The codec
    has a performance comparable to, or better than, the best known coding technology
    that might be tailored specifically to coding of either speech or general audio
    content. The codec supports single and multi-channel coding at high bitrates and
    provides perceptually transparent quality. At the same time, it enables very efficient
    coding at very low bitrates while retaining the full audio bandwidth.<br />\r\nThis
    document incorporates several perceptually-based compression techniques developed
    in previous MPEG standards: perceptually shaped quantization noise, parametric
    coding of the upper spectrum region and parametric coding of the stereo sound
    stage. However, it combines these well-known perceptual techniques with a source
    coding technique: a model of sound production, specifically that of human speech."
