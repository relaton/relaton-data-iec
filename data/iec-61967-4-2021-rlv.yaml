  content: "IEC 61967-4:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61967-4:2021
    specifies a method to measure the conducted electromagnetic emission (EME) of
    integrated circuits by direct radio frequency (RF) current measurement with a
    1 Ω resistive probe and RF voltage measurement using a 150 Ω coupling network.
    These methods ensure a high degree of reproducibility and correlation of EME measurement
    results. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- frequency range of 150 kHz to 1 GHz
    has been deleted from the title;<br />\r\n- recommended frequency range for 1
    Ω method has been reduced to 30 MHz;<br />\r\n- Annex G with recommendations and
    guidelines for frequency range extension beyond 1 GHz has been added."
