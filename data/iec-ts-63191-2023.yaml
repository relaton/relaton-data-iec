  content: "IEC TS 63191:2023 specifies recommendations about power quality measurement
    and assessment within installations.<br />\r\nThis document outlines the various
    phases needed for the establishment of a demand-side power quality measurement
    plan for buildings and industry installations.<br />\r\nSuch a power quality measurement
    plan will enable the optimization of the energy availability and efficiency, improve
    the assets lifetime and facilitate the resolutions of power quality problems.
    A power quality measurement plan encompasses the following phases:<br />\r\n•
    definition of the context, objectives and constraints;<br />\r\n• assessment of
    the initial power quality situation;<br />\r\n• definition of an action plan for
    the improvement of the power quality situation;<br />\r\n• implementation of the
    power quality measuring system;<br />\r\n• exploitation of the measurement system
    for the improvement of the power quality situation;<br />\r\n• maintenance of
    the measurement system.<br />\r\nThis document will also help facility managers
    tailor their measurement plan to the specific needs of the electrical system under
    their control. It addresses all the disturbances present in such networks, but
    does not cover the disturbances present in public electrical distribution networks
    (supply side) as they are governed by specific documents such as EN 50160 and
    IEC TS 62749.<br />\r\nIEC TS 63191:2023 cancels and replaces IEC TR 63191, published
    in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) a new informative Annex A describing a tool to report the
    ability to assess the power quality of an electrical installation."
