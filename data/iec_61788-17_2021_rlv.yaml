abstract:
- content: "IEC 61788-17:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61788-17:2021
    specifies the measurements of the local critical current density (Jc) and its
    distribution in large-area high-temperature superconducting (HTS) films by an
    inductive method using third-harmonic voltages. The most important consideration
    for precise measurements is to determine Jc at liquid nitrogen temperatures by
    an electric-field criterion and obtain current-voltage characteristics from its
    frequency dependence. Although it is possible to measure Jc in applied DC magnetic
    fields [20] [21], the scope of this document is limited to the measurement without
    DC magnetic fields. This technique intrinsically measures the critical sheet current
    that is the product of Jc and the film thickness d. The range and measurement
    resolution for Jcd of HTS films are as follows.<br />\r\n- Jcd: from 200 A/m to
    32 kA/m (based on results, not limitation).<br />\r\n- Measurement resolution:
    100 A/m (based on results, not limitation)."
