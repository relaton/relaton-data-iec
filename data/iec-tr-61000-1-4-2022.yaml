  content: "IEC TR 61000-1-4:2022 which is a technical report, reviews the sources
    and effects of power frequency conducted harmonic current emissions in the frequency
    range up to 2 kHz on the public electricity supply, and gives an account of the
    reasoning and calculations leading to the existing emission limits for equipment
    in the editions of IEC 61000-3-2, up to and including the fifth edition (2018)
    with Amendment 1 (2020), and in the second edition of IEC 61000-3-12. The history
    is traced from the first supra-national standard on low-frequency conducted emissions
    into the public electricity supply, EN 50006:1975 and its evolution through IEC
    (60)555-2 to IEC 61000-3-2, IEC TR 61000-3-4 and IEC 61000-3-12. To give a full
    picture of the history, that of the standard for the measuring instrument IEC
    61000-4-7 is mentioned as well. NOTE All IEC standards were renumbered starting
    from 60000 from 1998-01-01. To indicate the references of standards withdrawn
    before, or not reprinted after, that date, the “60x” prefix is here enclosed in
    parentheses. Hence “IEC (60)555-2”. Some concepts in this document apply to all
    low voltage AC systems, but the numerical values apply specifically to the European
    230 V;400 V 50 Hz system. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2005. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- relation between compatibility levels, emission limits and
    immunity requirements clarified;<br />\r\n- sharing of emission levels between
    LV, MV and HV clarified;<br />\r\n- new historical information added."
