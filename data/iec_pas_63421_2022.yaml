abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63421:2022(E) This Book 18 defines a standardized interface between
    a LED Luminaire and a sensing/communication module (Luminaire Extension Module,
    LEX-M) that can be attached to the Luminaire. The interface is intended to be
    used in outdoor applications with high IP rating. The LEX-M may provide for example
    sensory inputs to the Luminaire or communication between the Luminaire and a network.
    This Book 1 defines the common concepts that underlie the Zhaga interface specifications.
    In addition, this Book 1 specifies general requirements for Zhaga compliant components
    of LED Luminaires.
