    <p>This document (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from ICT &amp; CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber (ETC).</p>
    <p>This document (all parts) includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PC's.</p>
    <p>Part 1 specifies the methods to determine chemical emission rates of analyte from electronic equipment using consumables.</p>
    <p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p>
    <p>Emission rates from EUT may also be determined according to additional requirements identified by "RAL‑UZ 205 Option".</p>
    <p>Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables.</p>
    <p>The operational readiness of AMS is confirmed according to Annex B.</p>
    <p>Calculations use the generalised model and approximations thereof as developed in Annex C.</p>
    <p>The emission rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same class.</p>
    <p>Predictions of "real indoor" concentrations from the determined emission rates are outside the scope of this document.</p>
