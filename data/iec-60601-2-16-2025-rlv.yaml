  content: "IEC 60601-2-16:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-16:2025
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of HAEMODIALYSIS, HAEMODIAFILTRATION
    and HAEMOFILTRATION EQUIPMENT, hereafter referred to as HAEMODIALYSIS EQUIPMENT.
    It applies to HAEMODIALYSIS EQUIPMENT intended for use either by medical staff
    or under the supervision of medical experts, including HAEMODIALYSIS EQUIPMENT
    operated by the PATIENT, regardless of whether the HAEMODIALYSIS EQUIPMENT is
    used in a hospital or domestic environment. If a clause or subclause is specifically
    intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT only, or to ME SYSTEMS only, the title
    and content of that clause or subclause will say so. If that is not the case,
    the clause or subclause applies both to ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS, as relevant.
    This document does not take into consideration specific safety details of the
    DIALYSIS FLUID control system of HAEMODIALYSIS EQUIPMENT using regeneration of
    DIALYSIS FLUID or CENTRAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS for DIALYSIS FLUID. It does, however,
    take into consideration the specific safety requirements of such HAEMODIALYSIS
    EQUIPMENT concerning electrical safety and PATIENT safety. This document specifies
    the minimum safety requirements for HAEMODIALYSIS EQUIPMENT. These HAEMODIALYSIS
    EQUIPMENT are intended for use either by medical staff or for use by the PATIENT
    or other trained personnel under medical supervision. This document includes all
    ME EQUIPMENT that is intended to deliver a HAEMODIALYSIS, HAEMODIAFILTRATION and
    HAEMOFILTRATION treatment to a PATIENT, independent of the treatment duration
    and location. If applicable, this document applies to the relevant parts of ME
    EQUIPMENT intended for other extracorporeal blood purification treatments.<br
    />\r\nThe particular requirements in this document do not apply to:<br />\r\n–
    EXTRACORPOREAL CIRCUITS (see ISO 8637-2),<br />\r\n– DIALYSERS (see ISO 8637-1
    [2]),<br />\r\n– DIALYSIS FLUID CONCENTRATES (see ISO 23500-4),<br />\r\n– pre-manufactured
    DIALYSIS FLUID bags,<br />\r\n– DIALYSIS WATER supply systems (see ISO 23500-2),<br
    />\r\n– CENTRAL DELIVERY SYSTEMS for DIALYSIS FLUID CONCENTRATES (see ISO 23500-4),
    described as systems for bulk mixing concentrate at a dialysis facility,<br />\r\n–
    equipment used to perform PERITONEAL DIALYSIS (see IEC 60601-2-39).<br />\r\nIEC
    60601-2-16:2024 cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2018. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    update of references to IEC 60601‑1:2005, IEC 60601‑1:2005/AMD1:2012 and IEC 60601‑1:2005/AMD2:2020,
    of references to IEC 60601‑1‑2:2014 and IEC 60601‑1‑2:2014/AMD1:2020, of references
