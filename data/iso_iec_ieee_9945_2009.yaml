abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 defines a standard operating system interface
    and environment, including a command interpreter (or "shell"), and common utility
    programs to support applications portability at the source code level. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    9945:2009 is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementers
    and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume).</p><ul><li>General
    terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including
    utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base
    Definitions volume.</li><li>Definitions for system service functions and subroutines,
    language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues,
    including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the
    System Interfaces volume.</li><li>Definitions for a standard source code-level
    interface to command interpretation services (a "shell") and common utility programs
    for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume.</li><li>Extended
    rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document structure, which
    contains historical information concerning the contents of ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009
    and why features were included or discarded by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 developers,
    is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume.</li></ul><p>The following areas
    are outside the scope of ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009:</p><ul><li>graphics interfaces;</li><li>database
    management system interfaces;</li><li>record I/O considerations;</li><li>object
    or binary code portability;</li><li>system configuration and resource availability.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE
    9945:2009 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance
    to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed
    to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and
    facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.</p>
