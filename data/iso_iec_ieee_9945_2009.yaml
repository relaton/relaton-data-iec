abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 defines
    a standard operating system interface and environment, including a command interpreter
    (or "shell"), and common utility programs to support applications portability
    at the source code level. ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 is intended to be used by both
    application developers and system implementers and comprises four major components
    (each in an associated volume).</p><ul><li>General terms, concepts, and interfaces
    common to all volumes of this standard, including utility conventions and C-language
    header definitions, are included in the Base Definitions volume.</li><li>Definitions
    for system service functions and subroutines, language-specific system services
    for the C programming language, function issues, including portability, error
    handling, and error recovery, are included in the System Interfaces volume.</li><li>Definitions
    for a standard source code-level interface to command interpretation services
    (a "shell") and common utility programs for application programs are included
    in the Shell and Utilities volume.</li><li>Extended rationale that did not fit
    well into the rest of the document structure, which contains historical information
    concerning the contents of ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 and why features were included
    or discarded by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009 developers, is included in the Rationale
    (Informative) volume.</li></ul><p>The following areas are outside the scope of
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2009:</p><ul><li>graphics interfaces;</li><li>database management
    system interfaces;</li><li>record I/O considerations;</li><li>object or binary
    code portability;</li><li>system configuration and resource availability.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC/IEEE
    9945:2009 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance
    to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed
    to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and
    facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications.</p>
