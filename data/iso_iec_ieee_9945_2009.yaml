abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2008 defines a standard operating system interface and
    environment, including a command interpreter (or \"shell\"), and common utility
    programs to support applications portability at the source code level. ISO/IEC/IEEE
    9945:2008 is intended to be used by both application developers and system implementers
    and comprises four major components (each in an associated volume).<br />\r\n\tGeneral
    terms, concepts, and interfaces common to all volumes of this standard, including
    utility conventions and C-language header definitions, are included in the Base
    Definitions volume.<br />\r\n\tDefinitions for system service functions and subroutines,
    language-specific system services for the C programming language, function issues,
    including portability, error handling, and error recovery, are included in the
    System Interfaces volume.<br />\r\n\tDefinitions for a standard source code-level
    interface to command interpretation services (a \"shell\") and common utility
    programs for application programs are included in the Shell and Utilities volume.<br
    />\r\n\tExtended rationale that did not fit well into the rest of the document
    structure, which contains historical information concerning the contents of ISO/IEC/IEEE
    9945:2008 and why features were included or discarded by the ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2008
    developers, is included in the Rationale (Informative) volume.<br /><br /><br
    /><br />\r\nThe following areas are outside the scope of ISO/IEC/IEEE 9945:2008:<br
    />\r\n\tgraphics interfaces;<br />\r\n\tdatabase management system interfaces;<br
    />\r\n\trecord I/O considerations;<br />\r\n\tobject or binary code portability;<br
    />\r\n\tsystem configuration and resource availability.<br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE
    9945:2008 describes the external characteristics and facilities that are of importance
    to application developers, rather than the internal construction techniques employed
    to achieve these capabilities. Special emphasis is placed on those functions and
    facilities that are needed in a wide variety of commercial applications."
