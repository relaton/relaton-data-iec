  content: "IEC 61511-0:2018(E) provides an overview of the other three parts of IEC
    61511 Functional safety - safety instrumented systems for the process industry
    sector. There are many hazards in process industries that can lead to loss of
    containment, resulting in an impact on health, safety, environment and plant assets.
    Process safety is best achieved by using inherently safe processes. However, when
    this is not practical or possible, protective systems are required to mitigate
    the risk of hazards to an acceptable level. There are three parts to this series:<br
    />\r\nIEC 61511-1:2016, Functional safety - Safety instrumented systems for the
    process industry sector - Part 1: Framework, definitions, system, hardware and
    application programming requirements<br />\r\nIEC 61511-2:2016, Functional safety
    - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector - Part 2: Guidelines
    for the application of IEC 61511-1:2016<br />\r\nIEC 61511-3:2016, Functional
    safety - Safety instrumented systems for the process industry sector - Part 3:
    Guidance for the determination of the required safety integrity levels"
