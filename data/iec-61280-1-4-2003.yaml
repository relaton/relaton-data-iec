- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Provides a procedure for the collection of two-dimensional fibre optic
    nearfield grayscale data and subsequent reduction to one-dimensional data expressed
    as a set of three sampled parametric functions of radius from the fibre's optical
    center. The object is to reduce measurement errors and inter-laboratory variation.
