  content: "IEC 61196-4:2015(E) applies to radiating coaxial communication cables.
    These cables are intended for use in wireless communication systems, such as tunnels,
    railways, highways, subways, elevators and other installations in which conventional
    antenna transmission is not satisfactory or even impossible. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are
    as follows:<br />\r\n- a definition for coupling loss was added,<br />\r\n- Clause
    4 \"Materials and cable construction\" was added,<br />\r\n- rated temperature
    range, operating frequency and radiating characteristics as standard rating and
    characteristics were added,<br />\r\n- identification, marking and labeling was
    added,<br />\r\n- the tables of test procedures were revised,<br />\r\n- quality
    assessment and packaging was added,<br />\r\n- Annex C, \"Coupling loss around
    circumferential orientation of radiating cable\" was added,<br />\r\n- Annex D
    \"Radiating intensity around circumferential orientation of radiating cable\"
    was added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with
    <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4864\">IEC 61196-1:2005</a>."
