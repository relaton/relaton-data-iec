  content: "IEC 60730-2-8:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60730-2-8:2025 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60730-1:2022.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60730-2-8:2025 applies to electrically
    operated water valves<br />\r\n• for use in, on, or in association with equipment
    for household appliance and similar use;<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Throughout this document,
    the word \"equipment\" means \"appliance and equipment\" and \"control\" means
    \"electrically operated water valve\".<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 1 Electrically operated
    water valves for appliances within the scope of IEC 60335.<br />\r\n• for building
    automation within the scope of ISO 16484 series and IEC 63044 series (HBES/BACS);<br
    />\r\nEXAMPLE 2 Independently mounted water valves, controls in smart grid systems
    and controls for building automation systems within the scope of ISO 16484-2.<br
    />\r\n• for equipment that is used by the public, such as equipment intended to
    be used in shops, offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial applications;<br
    />\r\nEXAMPLE 3 Electrically operated water valves for commercial catering, heating
    and air-conditioning equipment.<br />\r\n• that are smart enabled electrically
    operated water valves;<br />\r\nEXAMPLE 4 Smart grid control, remote interfaces
    and controls of energy-consuming equipment including computer or smart phone.<br
    />\r\n• that are AC or DC powered electrically operated water valves with a rated
    voltage not exceeding 690 V AC or 600 V DC;<br />\r\n• used in, on, or in association
    with equipment that uses electricity, gas, oil, solid fuel, solar thermal energy,
    etc., or a combination thereof;<br />\r\n• utilized as part of a control system
    or controls which are mechanically integral with multifunctional controls having
    non-electrical outputs;<br />\r\n• using NTC or PTC thermistors and to discrete
    thermistors, requirements for which are contained in Annex J of Part 1;<br />\r\n•
    responsive to or controlling such characteristics as temperature, pressure, passage
    of time, humidity, light, electrostatic effects, flow, or liquid level, current,
    voltage, acceleration, or combinations thereof;<br />\r\n• in which actuators
    and valve bodies are designed to be fitted to each other.<br />\r\n• as well as
    manual controls when such are electrically or mechanically integral with automatic
    controls.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Requirements for manually actuated mechanical switches
    not forming part of an automatic control are contained in IEC 61058-1-1.<br />\r\nThis
    document applies to<br />\r\n- the inherent safety of electrically operated water
    valves, and<br />\r\n- functional safety of electrically operated water valves
    and safety related systems,<br />\r\n- controls where the performance (for example
    the effect of EMC phenomena) of the product can impair the overall safety and
    performance of the controlled system,<br />\r\n- the operating values, operating
    times, and operating sequences where such are associated with equipment safety.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies the requirements for construction, operation and
    testing of electrically operated water valves used in, on, or in association with
    an equipment.<br />\r\nThis document contains requirements for electrical features
    of water valves and requirements for mechanical features of valves that affect
    their intended operation.<br />\r\nThis document does not<br />\r\n• apply to
    electrically operated water valves intended exclusively for industrial process
    applications unless explicitly mentioned in the relevant Part 2 or the equipment
    standard. However, this document can be applied to evaluate automatic electrical
    controls intended specifically for industrial applications in cases where no relevant
    safety standard exists.<br />\r\n• apply to<br />\r\n- electrically operated water
    valves of nominal connection size above DN 50;<br />\r\n- electrically operated
    water valves for admissible nominal pressure rating above 1,6 MPa;<br />\r\n-
    food dispensers;<br />\r\n- detergent dispensers;<br />\r\n- steam valves;<br
    />\r\n• take into account the response value of an automatic action of a electrically
    operated water valve, if such a response value is dependent upon the method of
    mounting the control in the equipment. Where a response value is of significant
    purpose for the protection of the user, or surroundings, the value defined in
    the appropriate equipment standard or as determined by the manufacturer will apply.<br
    />\r\n• address the integrity of the output signal to the network devices, such
    as interoperability with other devices unless it has been evaluated as part of
    the control system.<br />\r\n• cover the prevention of contamination of drinking
    water as a result of contact with materials.<br />\r\nThroughout this document,
    where it can be used unambiguously, the term:<br />\r\n- \"valve\" is used to
    denote an electrically operated water valve (including actuator and valve body
    assembly);<br />\r\n- \"actuator\" means \"electrically operated mechanism or
    prime mover\";<br />\r\n- \"valve body\" means \"valve body assembly\";<br />\r\n-
    \"equipment\" includes \"appliance\" and \"control system\".<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) adoption of IEC 60730-1:2022 with all of its significant
    changes to IEC 60730-1:2013, IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD1:2015 and IEC 60730-1:2013/AMD2:2020.<br
    />\r\nThis part 2-8 is intended to be used in conjunction with IEC 60730-1. It
    was established on the basis of the sixth edition of that standard (2022). Consideration
    may be given to future editions of, or amendments to, IEC 60730‑1."
