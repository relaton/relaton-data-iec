    <p>ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 provides a common information model for describing the learner or user needs and preferences when accessing digitally delivered resources or services. This description is one side of a pair of descriptions used in matching user needs and preferences with education delivery (as described in ISO/IEC 24751-1).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 discusses the basic principles adhered to in developing this model for describing personal needs and preferences. It explains: the rationale for using a functional approach to describing needs, possible methods of creating a personal needs and preference statement, the major groupings of needs and preferences within the standard, the use of different needs and preferences statements in different contexts, how needs and preferences can be ranked with respect to priority, and the use of generic and application-specific needs and preference specifications. </p>
    <p>It contains the information model for ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008, including the attribute, allowed occurrence and datatype of each element. It defines and describes how the terms in the information model should be used. </p>
    <p>Conformance to ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 is discussed. Conformance is dependent on the role played by the conformant technology. Conformance requirements for both education delivery applications and alternative access systems are explained. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 provides </p>
    <ul>
    <li>a consolidated list of all the terms defined in ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008, sorted in French alphabetical order, </li>
    <li>the ISO French language equivalent terms and definitions, and</li>
    <li>the codes representing the gender of the French terms. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The vocabulary codes, values and associated rules of application are defined. An informative list of recommended default values for the learner preferences and needs is provided.</p>
    <p>It lists existing bindings of the IMS Learner Information Package Accessibility for LIP - Version 1 [ACCLIP] that serves as the reference specification for ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008.</p>
    <p>It describes information scenarios for applying ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 and gives informative implementation examples. </p>
    <p>Use of ISO/IEC 24751-2:2008 will assist in matching individual learner needs in a computer mediated learning environment with the necessary user interface and resources needed to meet those needs. </p>
