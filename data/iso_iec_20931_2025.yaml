- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document provides the icons to specify the
    function and to indicate status of the serviced offices and their services. The
    icons are used as the user interfaces for searching, booking, and advertising
    applications for serviced offices. This document specifies basic icons that define
    the functions of all serviced offices, and also specifies additional and miscellaneous
    icons that indicate other services. The functions specified by the icons include
    facilities, equipment and services for fulfilling various user needs such as working
    style, tools, amenities, language and accessibility needs, including older persons,
    etc.</p>
