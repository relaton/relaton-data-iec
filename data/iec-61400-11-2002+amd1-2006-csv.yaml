  content: "Presents measurement procedures that enable noise emissions of a wind
    turbine to be characterized with respect to a range of wind speeds and directions.
    Allows comparisons between different wind turbines. May be applied by wind turbine
    manufacturers, purchasers, operators and planners or regulators.\n\n<b>This consolidated
    version consists of the second edition (2002) and its amendment 1 (2006). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in\naddition to this publication.</b>                                   \n<br
