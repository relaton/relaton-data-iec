abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-13:2010+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    round copper winding wire of class 200 with a dual coating. The underlying coating
    is based on polyester or polyesterimide resin, which may be modified providing
    it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all specified
    wire requirements. The superimposed coating is based on polyamide-imide resin.
    The main changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br />\r\n- new requirements
    for appearance;<br />\r\n- reference to new resistance to refrigerants test in
    IEC 60851-4;<br />\r\n- deletion of high temperature failure requirement;<br />\r\n-
    new pin hole test requirements.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read
    in conjunction with IEC 60317-0-1:2008."
