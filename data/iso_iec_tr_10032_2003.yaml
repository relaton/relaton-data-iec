abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 10032:2003 defines the ISO Reference Model of Data Management. It establishes
    a framework for coordinating the development of existing and future standards
    for the management of persistent data in information systems.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 10032:2003 defines common terminology and concepts pertinent to all data held
    within information systems. Such concepts are used to define more specifically
    the services provided by particular data management components, such as database
    management systems or data dictionary systems. The definition of such related
    services identifies interfaces which may be the subject of future standardization.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TR 10032:2003 does not specify services and protocols for data management.
    ISO/IEC TR 10032:2003 is neither an implementation specification for systems,
    nor a basis for appraising the conformance of implementations.<br />\r\nThe scope
    of ISO/IEC TR 10032:2003 includes processes which are concerned with handling
    persistent data and their interaction with processes particular to the requirements
    of a specific information system. This includes common data management services
    such as those required to define, store, retrieve, update, maintain, backup, restore
    and communicate applications and dictionary data.<br />\r\nThe scope of ISO/IEC
    TR 10032:2003 includes consideration of standards for the management of data located
    on one or more computer systems, including services for distributed database management.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TR 10032:2003 does not include within its scope common services
    normally provided by an operating system including those processes which are concerned
    with specific types of physical storage devices, specific techniques for storing
    data, and specific details of communications and human computer interfaces."
