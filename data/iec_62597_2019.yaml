abstract:
- content: "IEC 62597:2019 is limited to apparatus, systems and fixed installations
    which are intended for use in the railway environment. The frequency range covered
    is 0 Hz to 300 GHz.<br />\r\nTechnical considerations and measurements are specified
    for frequencies up to 20 kHz because no relevant field strengths are expected
    above due to the physical nature of EMF‑sources in the railway environment.<br
    />\r\nThe object of this document is to provide measurement and calculation procedures
    of electric and magnetic field levels generated by electronic and electrical apparatus
    in the railway environment with respect to human exposure.<br />\r\nThe regulations
    regarding the protection of human beings during exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic
    fields in the railway environment are different within the countries worldwide.
    This document offers a procedure regarding measurement, simulation/calculation
    and evaluation.<br />\r\nThe measurement procedures and points of measurement
    cover also the aspect of persons bearing active implantable medical devices. This
    document does not apply to the risk assessment for persons bearing active implants
    in magnetic field generated by electronic and electrical apparatus in the railway
    environment.<br />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces IEC TS 62597 published
    in 2011. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the Technical Specification:<br />\r\na) Clause 3.1: The extent of
    “Terms and definitions” has been updated<br />\r\nb) Clause 3 was expanded by
    clause 3.2 “abbreviated terms”<br />\r\nc) Clause 4.2: The “surface method” for
    Rolling Stock measuement was deleted. Mandatory measurement method is former “volume
    method” with slightly modified measurement heghts.<br />\r\nd) Clause 4.3: Japanese
    set of measurement heghts for fixed installations was deleted.<br />\r\ne) Clause
    5.2 and new Annex B: Measurement technique for lower frequency range up to 5 Hz.<br
    />\r\nf) New Annex C: Consistency to IEC 62110 in some countries<br />\r\ng) Several
    editorial improvements have been included in the entire document"
