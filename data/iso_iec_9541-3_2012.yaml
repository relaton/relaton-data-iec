abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9541 specifies the architecture of font resources, as well
    as the formats for font interchange among information processing systems. ISO/IEC
    9541 also specifies the architecture and formats that can be used to construct
    font references in general electronic document interchange.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9541-3:2012
    specifies the architecture and interchange formats of glyph shape representations.</p><p>Font
    resources represented using the architecture and interchange formats defined in
    ISO/IEC 9541-1 and ISO/IEC 9541-2 are used in various document processing environments
    in which the RELAX NG (ISO/IEC 19757-2) parsing algorithm is recognized. The encoding
    of font resource information as defined in ISO/IEC 9541-3:2012 is specified in
    RELAX NG representation for consistent generation of font resources for use in
    these processing environments.</p>"
