abstract:
- content: "The ISO/IEC 30108 series defines biometric services used for identity
    assurance that are invoked over a services-based framework. It provides a generic
    set of biometric and identity-related functions and associated data definitions
    to allow remote access to biometric services.<br />\r\nAlthough focused on biometrics,
    the ISO/IEC 30108 series includes support for other related identity assurance
    mechanisms such as biographic and document capabilities. Identity attributes verification
    services (IAVSs) are intended to be compatible with and used in conjunction with
    other biometric standards as described in ISO/IEC 30108-1.<br />\r\nThis document
    implements the specification provided in ISO/IEC 30108-1 using representational
    state transfer (REST).<br />\r\nSpecification of biometric functionality is limited
    to remote (backend) services. Services between a client-side application and biometric
    capture devices are not within the scope of this document.<br />\r\nIntegration
    of biometric services as part of an authentication service or protocol is not
    within the scope of this document."
