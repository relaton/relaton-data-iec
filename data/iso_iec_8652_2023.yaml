abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 8652:2023 This document specifies the form and meaning of programs
    written in Ada. Its purpose is to promote the portability of Ada programs to a
    variety of computing systems.<br />\r\nThis document specifies:<br />\r\n- The
    form of a program written in Ada;<br />\r\n- The effect of translating and executing
    such a program;<br />\r\n- The manner in which program units can be combined to
    form Ada programs;<br />\r\n- The language-defined library units that a conforming
    implementation is required to supply;<br />\r\n- The permissible variations in
    conformance to the rules of this document, and the manner in which they are to
    be documented;<br />\r\n- Those violations of the requirements of this document
    that a conforming implementation is required to detect, and the effect of attempting
    to translate or execute a program containing such violations;<br />\r\n- Those
    violations of the requirements of this document that a conforming implementation
    is not required to detect.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify:<br />\r\n-
    The means whereby a program written in Ada is transformed into object code executable
    by a processor;<br />\r\n- The means whereby translation or execution of programs
    is invoked and the executing units are controlled;<br />\r\n- The size or speed
    of the object code, or the relative execution speed of different language constructs;<br
    />\r\n- The form or contents of any listings produced by implementations; in particular,
    the form or contents of error or warning messages;<br />\r\n- The effect of unspecified
    execution;<br />\r\n- The size of a program or program unit that will exceed the
    capacity of a particular conforming implementation."
