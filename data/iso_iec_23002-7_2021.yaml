abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the syntax and semantics of video usability information
    (VUI) parameters and supplemental enhancement information (SEI) messages. The
    VUI parameters and SEI messages defined in this document are designed to be conveyed
    within coded video bitstreams in a manner specified in a video coding specification
    or to be conveyed by other means determined by the specifications for systems
    that make use of such coded video bitstreams. This document is particularly intended
    for use with coded video bitstreams as specified by Rec. ITUâ€‘T H.266 | ISO/IEC
    23090-3, although it can also be used with other types of coded video bitstreams.<br
    />\r\nVUI parameters and SEI messages can assist in processes related to decoding,
    display or other purposes. However, unless otherwise specified in a referencing
    specification, the interpretation and use of the VUI parameters and SEI messages
    specified in this document is not a required functionality of a video decoder
    or receiving video system. Although semantics are specified for the VUI parameters
    and SEI messages, decoders and receiving video systems can simply ignore the content
    of the VUI parameters and SEI messages or can use them in a manner that somewhat
    differs from what is specified in this document."
