    <p>This document defines the test methods for determining the performance characteristics of chirp spread spectrum (CSS) real time locating system (RTLS) equipment including tags and readers which are applicable to the selection of equipment that conforms to ISO/IEC 24730‑5 for specific applications. This document does not apply to the testing in relation to regulatory or similar requirements.</p>
    <p>The RTLS equipment performance parameters included in this document only include the chirp spread spectrum (CSS) radio frequencies link between tags and readers. Unlike ISO/IEC 18305, the tests in this document apply exclusively to RTLS equipment defined in ISO/IEC 24730‑5 unless specified otherwise.</p>
