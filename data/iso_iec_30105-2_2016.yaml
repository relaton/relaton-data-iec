abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30105-2:2016 specifies the lifecycle process requirements performed
    by the IT enabled business process outsourcing service provider for the outsourced
    business processes. It defines the processes to plan, establish, implement, operate,
    monitor, review, maintain and improve its services. This document:<p>- covers
    IT enabled business processes that are outsourced;</p><p>- is not intended to
    cover IT services but includes similar, relevant process for completeness;</p><p>-
    is applicable to the service provider, not to the customer;</p><p>- is applicable
    to all lifecycle processes of ITES-BPO;</p><p>- serves as a process assessment
    model for organizations providing ITES-BPO services that:</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\t- conforms
    to the requirements of ISO/IEC 33004;\r\n\t- supports the performance assessment
    by providing indicators for the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes,
    as defined in ISO/IEC 24774, and the process attributes, as defined in ISO/IEC
    33020.<p>A process assessment model consists of a set of indicators for process
    performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting
    the objective evidence that enables an assessor to determine ratings. The set
    of indicators included in this document is not intended to be an all-inclusive
    set nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety. Supersets and subsets
    that are appropriate to the context and scope of the assessment should be selected.</p><p>The
    process assessment model in this document is directed at assessment sponsors and
    competent assessors who wish to select a model, and associated documented assessment
    process, for the ITES-BPO lifecycle processes, for risk determination or process
    improvement.</p>"
