abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC 62341-6-1:2017 is available as IEC 62341-6-1:2017 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    62341-6-1:2017(E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and measuring
    methods for determining optical and electro-optical parameters of organic light-emitting
    diode (OLED) display modules and, where specified, OLED display panels. These
    methods are limited to flat displays measured in a dark room.<br />\r\nThis second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) extends the
    applicability of the measuring methods to include OLED displays that have multi-primary
    or red, green, blue and white sub-pixels;<br />\r\nb) adds a method to characterize
    how the luminance is affected by the amount of content on the screen;<br />\r\nc)
    adds a method to determine the dark room colour gamut volume in the CIELAB colour
    space."
