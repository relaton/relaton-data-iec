abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 11770-3:2015 defines key management mechanisms based on asymmetric
    cryptographic techniques. It specifically addresses the use of asymmetric techniques
    to achieve the following goals: a) establish a shared secret key for use in a
    symmetric cryptographic technique between two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em>
    by key agreement. In a secret key agreement mechanism, the secret key is computed
    as the result of a data exchange between the two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em>.
    Neither of them should be able to predetermine the value of the shared secret
    key; b) establish a shared secret key for use in a symmetric cryptographic technique
    between two entities<em>A</em> and<em>B</em> via key transport. In a secret key
    transport mechanism, the secret key is chosen by one entity<em>A</em> and is transferred
    to another entity<em>B</em>, suitably protected by asymmetric techniques; and
    c) make an entity''s public key available to other entities via key transport.
    In a public key transport mechanism, the public key of entity<em>A</em> shall
    be transferred to other entities in an authenticated way, but not requiring secrecy.<p>Some
    of the mechanisms of ISO/IEC 11770-3:2015 are based on the corresponding authentication
    mechanisms in ISO/IEC 9798â€‘3.</p><p>ISO/IEC 11770-3:2015 does not cover certain
    aspects of key management, such as key lifecycle management, mechanisms to generate
    or validate asymmetric key pairs, and mechanisms to store, archive, delete, destroy,
    etc. keys.</p><p>While ISO/IEC 11770-3:2015 does not explicitly cover the distribution
    of an entity''s private key (of an asymmetric key pair) from a trusted third party
    to a requesting entity, the key transport mechanisms described can be used to
    achieve this. A private key can in all cases be distributed with these mechanisms
    where an existing, non-compromised key already exists. However, in practice the
    distribution of private keys is usually a manual process that relies on technological
    means such as smart cards, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 11770-3:2015 does not specify the
    transformations used in the key management mechanisms.</p>'
