abstract:
- content: IEC 61523-4:2015(E) establishes a format used to define the low-power design
    intent for electronic systems and electronic intellectual property (IP). The format
    provides the ability to specify the supply network, switches, isolation, retention,
    and other aspects relevant to power management of an electronic system. The standard
    defines the relationship between the low-power design specification and the logic
    design specification captured via other formats [e.g., standard hardware description
    languages (HDLs)].
