  content: "IEC 61196-4-1:2016 is a blank detail specification which applies to radiating
    coaxial communication cables. These cables are intended for use in wireless communication
    system, such as tunnels, railways, highways, subways, elevators and other installations
    in which conventional radio transmission is not satisfactory or even impossible.
    It determines the layout and style for detail specification. Detail specifications,
    based on the blank detail specification, may be prepared by a national organization
    a manufacturer, or a user.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication is to be read in
