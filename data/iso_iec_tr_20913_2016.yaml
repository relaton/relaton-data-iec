abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 20913:2016 describes backgrounds, motivation, and general
    concept of holistic methodology for data centre key performance indicators (KPIs)
    to investigate the status of KPIs. It discusses the usefulness of holistic investigation
    methodology in terms of aggregating a KPI across different contexts, aggregation
    of two or more KPIs within a single context, aggregation of two or more KPIs across
    multiple contexts, and aggregation of the multiple KPIs into a single indicator.
    This document presents a conventional spider web chart-based data centre KPIs
    status observation method and a control chart method including upper bound and
    lower bound of the operational status of KPIs. This document presents SWOT analysis
    results for both methodologies. The methods described in this document are aimed
    at the self-monitoring of a data centre, not comparison among data centres.</p><p>Specifically,
    ISO/IEC TR 20913:2016</p><p>a) describes backgrounds, motivation, and general
    concept of holistic investigation methodology for data centre KPIs,</p><p>b) analyses
    the usefulness of holistic investigation methodology for aggregating KPIs,</p><p>c)
    describes a spider web chart-based KPIs status observation method and a control
    chart extending spider web chart to observe the operational status of KPIs,</p><p>d)
    describes alternative and/or additional methods of representing dissimilar KPIs
    to track holistic resource effectiveness of the data centre, and</p><p>e) presents
    SWOT analysis results for holistic investigation methods described in this document.</p>"
