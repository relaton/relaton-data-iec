It describes controls applying to such functions as: Play, Pause, Stop, Rewind, Scan forward, Scan backward, Replay backward, Loop, Go to beginning, Go to previous, Go to next, Go to end, Set volume and Mute. </p>
    <p>Each control icon is specified with the following:</p>
    <ul><li>Primary function</li><li>Specific instance</li><li>Components</li><li>Graphic</li></ul>
    <p>Multimedia control icons enable users to invoke functions that act upon a pre-selected or default objects. Functions initiated by these icons may also be available via text commands on menus. Multimedia icons provide direct access to functions by graphically representing those text commands.</p>
