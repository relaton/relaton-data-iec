abstract:
- content: "IEC 62208:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62208:2023 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 62208:2011
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 121B experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62208:2023 applies to empty enclosures, as provided by the enclosure
    manufacturer, prior to the incorporation of switchgear and controlgear components
    by the assembly manufacturer. This document specifies general definitions, classifications,
    characteristics and test requirements of enclosures to be used as part of switchgear
    and controlgear assemblies (e.g. in accordance with the product standard in the
    IEC 61439 series), the rated voltage of which does not exceed 1 000 V AC or 1
    500 V DC, and suitable for general use for either indoor or outdoor applications.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2011.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    consideration of the modifications introduced in IEC 61439-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    alignment of test procedures with the newest relevant standards."
