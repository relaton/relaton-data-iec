  content: "IEC 60364-4-44:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60364-4-44:2024
    provides requirements for the safety of electrical installations in the event
    of voltage disturbances and electromagnetic disturbances generated for different
    specified reasons. The requirements of this document are not intended to apply
    to systems for distribution of energy to the public, or power generation and transmission
    for such systems (see the scope of IEC 60364-1) although such disturbances can
    be conducted into or between electrical installations via these supply systems.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2007,
    Amendment 1:2015 and Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the structure of the document has been updated
    in accordance with the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2021: the terms, definitions
    and symbols have been regrouped under a new Subclause 440.3, the tables and figures
    have been renumbered;<br />\r\nb) Clause 443 has been amended to better introduce
    the DC SPD and to improve some of the wording."
