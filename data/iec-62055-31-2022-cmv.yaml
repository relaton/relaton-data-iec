  content: "IEC 62055-31:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62055-31:2022 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62055-31:2005
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 13 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62055-31:2022 applies to newly manufactured, static watt-hour
    payment meters of accuracy classes 0,5, 1 and 2 for direct connection, for the
    measurement of alternating current electrical energy consumption of a frequency
    in the range 45 Hz to 65 Hz that include a supply control switch for the purpose
    of interruption or restoration of the electricity supply to the load in accordance
    with the current value of the available credit maintained in the payment meter.
    It does not apply to static watt-hour payment meters where the voltage across
    the connection terminals exceeds 1 000 V (line-to-line voltage for meters for
    polyphase systems). It applies to payment meters for indoor application, operating
    under normal climatic conditions where the payment meter is mounted as for normal
    service (i.e. together with a specified matching socket where applicable). Payment
    meters are implementations where all the main functional elements are incorporated
    in a single enclosure, together with any specified matching socket. There are
    also multi-device payment metering installations where the various main functional
    elements, such as the measuring element, the user interface unit, token carrier
    interface, and the supply control switch are implemented in more than one enclosure,
    involving additional interfaces. Functional requirements that apply to payment
    meters are also defined in this document, and include informative basic functional
    requirements and tests for the prepayment mode of operation in Annex A. Allowances
    are made for the relatively wide range of features, options, alternatives, and
    implementations that may be found in practice. The diverse nature and functionality
    of payment meters prevent the comprehensive specification of detailed test methods
    for all of these requirements. However, in this case, the requirements are stated
    in such a way that tests can then be formulated to respect and validate the specific
    functionality of the payment meter being tested. This document does not cover
    specific functionality or performance requirements for circuit protection, isolation
    or similar purposes that may be specified through reference to other specifications
    or standards. Safety requirements removed from Edition 1.0 have been replaced
    with references to the safety requirements now contained in IEC 62052-31:2015,
    the product safety standard for newly manufactured electricity meters. In-service
    safety testing (ISST) is not covered by IEC 62052-31:2015 and is left to national
    best practice usually as an extension of existing in-service testing (IST) of
    metrology stability. This document does not cover software requirements. This
    document covers type-testing requirements only. For acceptance testing, the requirements
    given in IEC 62058‑11:2008 and IEC 62058-31:2008 may be used. Dependability aspects
    are addressed in the IEC 62059 series of standards. Additional reliability, availability,
    maintenance and life cycle aspects are provided by IEC TC 56. This document does
    not cover conformity tests and system compliance tests that may be required in
    connection with legal or other requirements of some markets. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2005. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Title modified.<br
    />\r\nb) Removal of the contents of Annex C relating to the requirements for the
    supply control switch, and added reference to IEC 62052-31:2015 which contains
