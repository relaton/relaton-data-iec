abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 restates and elaborates on the procedures and techniques
    of ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003 for registering classification schemes and classifying
    administered items in a metadata registry (MDR). All types of administered items
    can be classified, including object classes, properties, representations, value
    domains, and data element concepts, as well as data elements themselves.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 develops a set of principles, methods, and procedures
    for specifying what is needed (at a minimum) to document the association between
    the various types of administered items and one or more classification schemes.
    This includes the names, definitions, and other aspects of the classification
    scheme and its contents. These can be captured through the use of a set of attributes.
    Particular attributes are specified in ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005, along with a structure
    for the contents of these attributes. Users may extend the set of attributes as
    necessary. Additional information may accompany a taxonomy or ontology; for example,
    to provide a suggested set of qualifiers that could be applied to the object class,
    property, or representation taxa to more fully qualify the classification of the
    particular administered item. ISO/IEC 11179-2:2005 summarizes the basic attributes
    and model specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003."
