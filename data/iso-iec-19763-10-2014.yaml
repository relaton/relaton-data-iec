    <p>ISO/IEC 19763-10: 2014 specifies a metamodel framework for interoperability. This part of ISO/IEC 19763 specifies the metamodel that provides a facility to register administrative information and common semantics of models and mapping between two models.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19763-10: 2014 does not specify the metamodel of models in a specific language, but provides a common core metamodel for the other parts of ISO/IEC 19763, each of which specifies a metamodel for a registry that can register models of a specific type, such as ontologies, process models or information models, in a number of different languages.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19763-10: 2014 also provides a metamodel for registering the mappings between two models registered in those other parts of ISO/IEC 19763.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19763-10: 2014 utilises the common facilities specified in ISO/IEC 11179‑3. ISO/IEC 11179 (all parts) specifies a metadata registry (MDR). These common facilities provide the ability to identify and register models and their associated model elements and modelling languages within a metadata registry used to register models.</p>
