abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 191 coded graphic characters
    identified as Latin alphabet No. 9.<br />This set of coded graphic characters
    is intended for use in data and text processing applications and also for information
    interchange.<br />The set contains graphic characters used for general purpose
    applications in typical office environments in at least the following languages:</p><p>Albanian,
    Basque, Breton, Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French,
    Frisian, Galician, German, Greenlandic, Icelandic,<br />Irish Gaelic (new orthography),
    Italian, Latin, Luxemburgish, Norwegian, Portuguese, RhaetoRomanic, Scottish Gaelic,
    Spanish, and Swedish.</p><p>This set of coded graphic characters may be regarded
    as a version of an 8-bit code according to ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level
    1.<br />This part of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in conjunction with any other
    parts of ISO/IEC 8859. If coded characters from more than one part are to<br />be
    used together, by means of code extension techniques, the equivalent coded character
    sets from ISO/IEC 10367 should be used instead within<br />a version of ISO/IEC
    4873 at level 2 or level 3.<br />The coded characters in this set may be used
    in conjunction with coded control functions selected from ISO/IEC 6429. However,
    control functions are<br />not used to create composite graphic symbols from two
    or more graphic characters (see clause 6).</p><p><br />NOTE – ISO/IEC 8859 is
    not intended for use with Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information
    coded according to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such services, it will
    have to conform to the requirements of those services at the access-point.</p>"
