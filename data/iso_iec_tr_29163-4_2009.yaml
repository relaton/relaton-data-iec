abstract:
- content: "Within the context of the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM®),
    ISO/IEC TR 29163-4:2009 describes how SCORM® conformant content can be sequenced
    to the learner through a set of learner or system-initiated navigation events.
    The branching and flow of that content can be described by a predefined set of
    activities.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 29163-4:2009 covers the essential Learning
    Management System (LMS) responsibilities for sequencing content objects (Sharable
    Content Objects [SCOs] or Assets) during run-time and allowing SCOs to indicate
    navigation requests. In addition, guidance is offered for providing navigation
    controls to learners. General subjects discussed include the following:<p></p><br
    />\r\n\tSequencing Concepts and Terminology (e.g., Learning Activities, Activity
    Trees, Clusters);<br />\r\n\tSequencing Definition Model (i.e., detailed descriptions
    and requirements of the sequencing information that can be applied to learning
    activities);<br />\r\n\tSequencing Behavior Model (i.e., detailed descriptions
    of LMS behaviors to prescribed sequencing information and learner's experience
    with learning content);<br />\r\n\tNavigation Controls and Requirements;<br />\r\n\tNavigation
    Data Model.<br /><br /><br /><br /><p></p><p><br />\r\nCommunication between content
    and LMSs facilitates use of SCORM® Sequencing and Navigation to present content
    to learners based on learner choices and performance at run-time. This communication
    also enables LMSs to track learner completion and progress while content is presented
    to the learner. ISO/IEC TR 29163-4:2009 describes in detail how sequencing behaviors
    are applied to track learner progress.</p>"
