    <p>ISO/IEC 7811-8:2014 defines the characteristics for identification cards as defined in Clause 4 of this part of ISO/IEC 7811, and the use of such cards for international interchange.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 7811-8:2014 specifies requirements for a 51,7 kA/m (650 Oe) magnetic stripe (including any protective overlay) on an identification card. The encoding technique and coded character sets are not defined, however, the specifications of ISO/IEC 7811‑2 may be used. It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.</p>
    <p>Coercivity influences many of the quantities specified in this part of ISO/IEC 7811. It has a nominal value of 51,7 kA/m (650 Oe), but is not itself specified. Exposure of the card to a magnetic field is likely to destroy the recorded data.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 7811-8:2014 provides criteria to which cards are to perform. No consideration is given within this International Standard to the amount of use, if any, experienced by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria is negotiated between the involved parties.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10373‑2 specifies the test procedures used to check cards against the parameters specified in this part of ISO/IEC 7811.</p>
    <p>Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial measurement system in this part of ISO/IEC 7811 may have been rounded off and therefore are consistent with, but not exactly equal to, each other. Either system may be used, but the two are not to be intermixed or reconverted. The original design was made using the Imperial measurement system.</p>
