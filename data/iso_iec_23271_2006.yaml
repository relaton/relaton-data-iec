abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23271:2006 defines the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) in
    which applications written in multiple high-level languages can be executed in
    different system environments without the need to rewrite those applications to
    take into consideration the unique characteristics of those environments. It consists
    of the following parts:<br />\r\nPartition I: Concepts and Architecture -- Describes
    the overall architecture of the CLI, and provides the normative description of
    the Common Type System (CTS), the Virtual Execution System (VES), and the Common
    Language Specification (CLS). It also provides an informative description of the
    metadata.<br />\r\nPartition II: Metadata Definition and Semantics -- Provides
    the normative description of the metadata, its physical layout (as a file format),
    its logical contents (as a set of tables and their relationships), and its semantics
    (as seen from a hypothetical assembler, ILAsm).<br />\r\nPartition III: CIL Instruction
    Set -- Describes the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instruction set.<br />\r\nPartition
    IV: Profiles and Libraries -- Provides an overview of the CLI Libraries, and a
    specification of their factoring into Profiles and Libraries. A companion file,
    CLILibrary.xml, considered to be part of this Partition, but distributed in XML
    format, provides details of each class, value type, and interface in the CLI Libraries.<br
    />\r\nPartition V: Debug Interchange Format.<br />\r\nPartition VI: Annexes --
    Contains some sample programs written in CIL Assembly Language (ILAsm), information
    about a particular implementation of an assembler, a machine-readable description
    of the CIL instruction set which can be used to derive parts of the grammar used
    by this assembler, as well as other tools that manipulate CIL, a set of guidelines
    used in the design of the libraries of Partition IV, and portability considerations."
