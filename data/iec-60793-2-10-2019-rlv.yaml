  content: "IEC 60793-2-10:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60793-2-10:2019
    is applicable to optical fibre sub-categories A1-OM1, A1-OM2, A1-OM3, A1-OM4,
    A1-OM5, and A1d. These fibres are used or can be incorporated in information transmission
    equipment and optical fibre cables. Sub-categories A1-OM2, A1-OM3, A1-OM4 and
    A1-OM5 apply to 50/125 µm graded index fibre in four bandwidth grades. Each of
    these bandwidth grades is defined for two levels of macrobend loss performance
    that are distinguished by \"a\" or \"b\" suffix. Those sub-categories with suffix
    \"a\" are specified to meet traditional macrobend loss performance levels. Those
    sub-categories with suffix \"b\" are specified to meet enhanced macrobend loss
    (i.e. lower loss) performance levels. Sub-category A1-OM5 is specified to support
    single wavelength or multi-wavelength transmission systems in the vicinity of
    850 nm to 950 nm. Although not normatively specified, bandwidth information covering
    this wavelength range is also included for A1-OM3 and A1-OM4. Sub-category A1-OM1
    applies to 62,5/125 µm graded index fibre and sub-category A1d applies to 100/140
    µm graded index fibre. Other applications include, but are not restricted to,
    the following: short reach, high bit-rate systems in telephony, distribution and
    local networks carrying data, voice and/or video services; on-premises intra-building
    and inter-building fibre installations including data centres, local area networks
    (LANs), storage area networks (SANs), private branch exchanges (PBXs), video,
    various multiplexing uses, outside telephone cable plant use, and miscellaneous
    related uses.Three types of requirements apply to these fibres:<br />\r\n- general
    requirements, as defined in IEC 60793-2;<br />\r\n- specific requirements common
    to the category A1 multimode fibres covered in this document and which are given
    in Clause 5;<br />\r\n- particular requirements applicable to individual fibre
    sub-categories and models, or specific applications, which are defined in the
    normative specification Annexes A to D.<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels
    and replaces the sixth edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant change with respect
    to the previous edition: revision of the naming convention for A1 multimode fibres,
    which better matches with those found in ISO/IEC standards. These changes are
    outlined in the scope of this document along with a cross reference table for
    the new names.<br />\r\nKeywords: optical fibre sub-categories A1-OM1, A1-OM2,
    A1-OM3, A1-OM4, A1-OM5, and A1d"
