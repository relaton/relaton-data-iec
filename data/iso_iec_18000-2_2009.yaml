abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the air interface for radio frequency
    identification (RFID) devices operating below 135 kHz. The purpose of ISO/IEC
    18000-2:2009 is to provide a common technical specification for RFID devices that
    can be used by ISO committees developing RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009
    is intended to allow for compatibility and to encourage inter-operability of products
    in the international marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009 defines the physical layer
    used for communication between the interrogator and the tag and further defines
    the communications protocol used in the air interface.</p><p>Two types of tag
    are defined by ISO/IEC 18000-2:2009: Type A and Type B, which differ only by their
    physical layer. Both support the same inventory (anti-collision) and protocol.</p><p>Type
    A tags are permanently powered by the interrogator, including during the tag-to-interrogator
    transmission, and operate at 125 kHz.</p><p>Type B tags are powered by the interrogator,
    except during the tag-to-interrogator transmission, and operate at 125 kHz or
    134,2 kHz.</p>"
