  script: Latn
  content: Deals with the safety of high pressure cleaners for household, industrial
    and commercial use having a pressure not less than 2,5 MPa and not more than 25
    MPa and with an input to the drive for the high pressure pump not exceeding 10
    kW, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances. It also applies to industrial and commercial steam
    cleaners even if the pressure is less than 2,5 MPa. It is also applicable to appliances
    making use of other forms of energy for the motor, but it is necessary that their
    influence is taken into consideration. This consolidated version consists of the
    second edition (2002) and its amendment 1 (2004). Therefore, no need to order
    amendment in addition to this publication.
