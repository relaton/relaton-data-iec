abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard defines the requirements for the handling of network addresses
    for the identification of entities which use or provide telecommunication services
    offered by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs). This International Standard
    covers numbering, including the requirements for the support of a Private Numbering
    Plan, the addressing of network service access points for open systems interconnection
    (OSI NSAP addressing), and the support of subaddressing.<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard is applicable to Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges with broad-band
    and narrow-band capabilities (PINX) and to terminals to be attached to the access
    of PINXs. Any use by a PINX of the Support of Private Numbering Plans supplementary
    service provided by a public ISDN is outside the scope of this International Standard.<br
    />\r\nAlthough this International Standard does not explicitly describe its application
    to location-independent (mobile) addressable entities, this application is not
    precluded."
