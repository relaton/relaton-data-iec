abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard defines the requirements for the handling
    of network addresses for the identification of entities</p><p>which use or provide
    telecommunication services offered by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISNs).
    This International</p><p>Standard covers numbering, including the requirements
    for the support of a Private Numbering Plan, the addressing of</p><p>network service
    access points for open systems interconnection (OSI NSAP addressing), and the
    support of subaddressing.</p><p>This International Standard is applicable to Private
    Integrated Services Network Exchanges with broad-band and narrow-band</p><p>capabilities
    (PINX) and to terminals to be attached to the access of PINXs. Any use by a PINX
    of the Support of Private</p><p>Numbering Plans supplementary service provided
    by a public ISDN is outside the scope of this International Standard.</p><p>Although
    this International Standard does not explicitly describe its application to location-independent
    (mobile) addressable</p><p>entities, this application is not precluded.</p>"
