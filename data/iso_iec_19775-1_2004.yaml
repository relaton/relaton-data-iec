abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 defines the architecture and base components of X3D.
    ISO/IEC 19775, X3D, defines a software system that integrates network-enabled
    3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based
    space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified
    through a variety of mechanisms.<br /><br />\r\nThe semantics of X3D describe
    an abstract functional behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information.
    ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent
    concepts (e.g. screen resolution and input devices). ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004 is intended
    for a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in
    interpretation and implementation of the functionality. For example, ISO/IEC 19775-1:2004
    does not assume the existence of a mouse or 2D display device.<br /><br />\r\nEach
    X3D application:<br />\r\nimplicitly establishes a world coordinate space for
    all objects defined, as well as all objects included by the application;<br />\r\nexplicitly
    defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects;<br />\r\ncan specify
    hyperlinks to other files and applications;<br />\r\ncan define programmatic or
    data-driven object behaviours;<br />\r\ncan connect to external modules or applications
    via programming and scripting languages;<br />\r\nexplicitly declares its functional
    requirements by specifying a profile;<br />\r\ncan declare additional functional
    requirements by specifying components."
