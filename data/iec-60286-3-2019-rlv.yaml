    is applicable to the tape packaging of electronic components without leads or
    with lead stumps, intended to be connected to electronic circuits. It includes
    only those dimensions that are essential for the taping of components intended
    for the above-mentioned purposes. This document also includes requirements related
    to the packaging of singulated die products including bare die and bumped die
    (flip chips). This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of a table of the classification
    to symbols concerning tape, reel and common symbols;<br />\r\n- additions of a
    figure of example of polarity and orientation and a figure of example of dot seal;<br
    />\r\n- revision of requirements for camber;<br />\r\n- addition of a definition
    of design value with regard to tilt.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
