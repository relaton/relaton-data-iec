    <p>ISO/IEC 18000 defines the air interfaces for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices used in item management applications. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the active air interface for these devices operating in the 433,92 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) band. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 18047 provides test methods for conformance with the various parts of ISO/IEC 18000. ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 contains the compliance measurements required to be fulfilled by a product in order to be compliant to ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009, but does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p>
    <p>The test methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented, be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general case.</p>
    <p>The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 are the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;</li>
    <li>parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following are not included in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;</li>
    <li>high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962). </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC TR 18047-7:2010 are to be applied exclusively to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-7.</p>
