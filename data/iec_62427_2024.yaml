abstract:
- content: "IEC 62427:2024 describes a process to demonstrate compatibility between
    rolling stock (RST) and train detection systems (TDS). It describes the characterization
    of train detection systems, rolling stock and traction power supply systems.<br
    />\r\nIt is worth noting that the demonstration of technical compatibility between
    the rolling stock and infrastructure with respect to physical dimensions is not
    detailed in this document.<br />\r\nThis document is not generally applicable
    to those combinations of rolling stock, traction power supply and train detection
    system which were accepted as compatible prior to the publication of this document.
    However, as far as is reasonably practicable, this document can be applied to
    modifications of rolling stock, traction power supply or train detection systems
    which can affect compatibility. The detailed process can be used where no rules
    and processes for compatibility are established.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) generic compatibility
    process, which is broken into a two-stage process depending on whether there are
    established compatibility limits or not;<br />\r\nb) rules for characterization
    of train detection systems;<br />\r\nc) rules for characterization of rolling
    stock;<br />\r\nd) rules for characterization of the power system;<br />\r\ne)
    informative references are provided in notes to established CENELEC standards
    for compatibility;<br />\r\nf) terminology is updated."
