  content: "IEC PAS 61191-10:2022(E) provides guidelines which deal with the requirements
    for the protective coating,<br />\r\nits properties, as well as the application
    of liquid coating materials for electronic assemblies. These guidelines help control
    in practice the application of protective coatings from the layout to the functional
    test of the assembly after coating."
