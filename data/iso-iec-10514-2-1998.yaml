    <p><b>1.1 General</b></p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10514 specifies extensions to allow generic programming facilities to be added to the base Modula-2</p>
    <p>language defined in International Standard ISO/IEC 10514-1 without altering the meaning of valid programs allowed by the</p>
    <p>Base Language (except for the use of the new keyword introduced by this standard—see clause 5).</p>
    <p><b>1.2 Specifications included in this part of ISO/IEC 10514</b></p>
    <p>In addition to the specifications included in the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514 provides specifications for:</p>
    <p>— required symbols for programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;</p>
    <p>— the lexical structure and semantics of programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;</p>
    <p>— the syntax of programs written in ISO Standard Modula-2 with Generic extensions;</p>
    <p>— violations of the rules for the use of the Generic extensions that a conforming implementation is required to detect;</p>
    <p>— further compliance requirements for implementations, including documentation requirements.</p>
    <p><b>1.3 Relationship to ISO/IEC 10514-1</b></p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is part two of the multi-part Standard ISO/IEC 10514. This part of ISO/IEC 10514 extends and</p>
    <p>modifies the Base Language ISO/IEC 10514-1, but the adoption of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is optional with respect to the</p>
    <p>Base Language. This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is also independent of any other parts of ISO/IEC 10514, except for part 1, and</p>
    <p>can be adopted either together with or independently of such other parts.</p>
    <p><b>1.4 Specifications not within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 10514</b></p>
    <p>In addition to the categories of specifications excluded by the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514 provides no</p>
    <p>specifications for:</p>
    <p>— the method by which specific refinements are constructed from generic library modules;</p>
    <p>— the method by which generic library modules, their associated refining modules, and the refinements produced by these are</p>
    <p>stored (including any correspondence between the module names and system file names where files are used).</p>
