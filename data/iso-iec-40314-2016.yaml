    <p>ISO/IEC 40314:2016 defines the Mathematical Markup Language, or MathML. </p>
    <p>MathML is a markup language for describing mathematical notation and capturing both its structure and content. The goal of MathML is to enable mathematics to be served, received, and processed on the World Wide Web, just as HTML has enabled this functionality for text.</p>
    <p>MathML can be used to encode both mathematical notation and mathematical content. Additional chapters discuss how the MathML content and presentation elements interact, and how MathML renderers might be implemented and should interact with browsers. Finally, this document addresses the issue of special characters used for mathematics, their handling in MathML, their presence in Unicode, and their relation to fonts.</p>
    <p>MathML was originally specified as an XML application and most of the examples in this specification assume that syntax. Unless explictly noted, the examples in this specification are also valid HTML syntax.</p>
