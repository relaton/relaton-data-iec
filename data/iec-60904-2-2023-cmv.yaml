  content: "IEC 60904-2:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60904-2:2023 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60904-2:2015
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 82 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60904-2:2023 gives requirements for the classification, selection,
    packaging, marking, calibration and care of photovoltaic reference devices. This
    document applies to photovoltaic (PV) reference devices that are used to measure
    the irradiance of natural or simulated sunlight for the purpose of quantifying
    the electrical performance of photovoltaic devices (cells, modules and arrays).
    It does not cover photovoltaic reference devices for use under concentrated sunlight.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2015.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added calibration procedures for calibrating
    PV devices at maximum power by extending the respective Clauses 12 and 13;<br
    />\r\nb) revised requirements for mandatory measurement of spectral responsivity,
    temperature coefficients and linearity, depending on usage and allowing some measurements
    on equivalent devices;<br />\r\nc) revised requirements for built-in shunt resistor;<br
    />\r\nd) added requirements for traceability of calibration explicitly."
