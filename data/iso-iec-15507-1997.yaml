    <p>This International Standard specifies the signalling protocol for the support of clock synchronization (SYNC-SIG) between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). </p>
    <p>This protocol supports the synchronization of a PISN using the different sources of clocks available to each PINX. The protocol is based on the method of synchronization described in annex F of the International Standard ISO/IEC 11573. This International Standard is applicable to PINXs which tan be interconnected to form a PISN.</p>
