  content: "IEC 60331-3:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60331-3:2018
    specifies the test method for cables which are required to maintain circuit integrity
    when tested in a metal enclosure and when subject to fire and mechanical shock
    under specified conditions. This document is applicable to cables of rated voltage
    not exceeding 600 V/1 000 V, including those of rated voltage below 80 V, metallic
    data and telecom cables and optical fibre cables. It is intended for use when
    testing cables not greater than 20 mm overall diameter. This document includes
    details for the specific point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test
    sample, test procedure and test report relevant to electric power and control
    cables with rated voltage up to and including 600 V/1 000 V. Details for the specific
    point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample, test procedure
    and test report relevant to metallic data and telecom cables and optical fibre
    cables are not given by IEC 60331-3. Although the scope is restricted to cables
    with rated voltage up to and including 0,6/1,0 kV, the procedure can be used,
    with the agreement of the manufacturer and the purchaser, for cables with rated
    voltage up to and including 1,8/3 (3,3) kV, provided that suitable fuses are used.
    It is not assumed that cables successfully assessed by this method, will also
    pass requirements for either IEC 60331-1 or IEC 60331-2. Testing to either of
    these two standards is to be carried out separately. Such additional performance
    can be recognised by the marking in accordance with IEC 60331-1:2018 Clause 11
    or IEC 60331 2:2018 Clause 11. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2009. It constitutes a technical revision. The significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n–
    extension of the scope to include metallic data and telecom cables and optical
    fibre cables, although details for the specific point of failure, continuity checking
    arrangement, test sample, test procedure and test report relevant to metallic
    data and telecom cables and optical fibre cables are not given by IEC 60331-3;<br
    />\r\n– improved description of the test environment;<br />\r\n– mandatory use
    of mass flow meter/controllers as the means of controlling accurately the input
    flow rates of fuel and air to the burner;<br />\r\n– improved description of the
    information to be included in the test report."
