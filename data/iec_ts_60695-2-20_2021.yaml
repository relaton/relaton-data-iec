abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60695-2-20:2021 describes a test method that applies to solid electrical
    insulating materials of which test specimens can be provided. The test measures
    the time required to ignite a test specimen when it is affected by heat from an
    electrically heated wire wound around the test specimen. If the test specimen
    drips, the time at which this occurs is also recorded.<br />\r\nThe test method
    can be used to provide classifications which can be used for quality assurance,
    the preselection of materials of products as described in IEC 60695-1-30, or to
    verify the required minimum classification of materials used in end products.<br
    />\r\nThis basic safety publication is intended for use by technical committees
    in the preparation of standards in accordance with the principles laid down in
    IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nOne of the responsibilities of a
    technical committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety publications
    in the preparation of its publications. The requirements, test methods or test
    conditions of this basic safety publication will not apply unless specifically
    referred to or included in the relevant publications.<br />\r\nThis third edition
    of IEC TS 60695-2-20 cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC TS 60695-2-20
    published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n– Contents page added<br />\r\n– Updated Scope (Clause
    1)<br />\r\n– Updated Terms and Definitions, added new relevant terms (Clause
    3)<br />\r\n– Updated Principle (Clause 4)<br />\r\n– Updated Apparatus (Clause
    5; recommendation to change the power source from a.c. to d.c. with a constant
    current output. Reason for this recommendation: d.c. technology is easier to obtain
    and to handle, which has been found to improve the Repeatability and Reproducibility
    of the test.<br />\r\n– Updated Test specimen dimensions (6.2)<br />\r\n– Revised
    Test procedure (Clause 8)<br />\r\n– Revised Observations and measurements (Clause
    9)<br />\r\n– Revised Evaluation of test results (Clause 10)<br />\r\n– Revised
    Test report (Clause 11)<br />\r\n– Revised Annex A: Deletion of conformational
    test; Guidance on verification of the heater wire winding before testing<br />\r\n–
    Addition of normative Annex B: HWCT PLC Classes<br />\r\n– Addition of informative
    Annex C: Calibration curve to determine test current (Ic) in a spreadsheet program<br
    />\r\n– Addition of informative Annex D: Precision data<br />\r\nIt has the status
    of a basic safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide
    51.<br />\r\nThis basic safety publication is intended for use by technical committees
    in the preparation of standards in accordance with the principles laid down in
    IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51."
