- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-34:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-34:2024 CMV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-34:2024 deals with the safety of sealed (hermetic and
    semi-hermetic type) motor-compressors, their protection and control systems, if
    any, which are intended for use in equipment for household and similar purposes
    and which conform with the standards applicable to such equipment. It applies
    to motor-compressors tested separately, under the most severe conditions that
    can be expected to occur in normal use, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V for single-phase motor-compressors and 600 V for multi-phase, 600 V direct-current
    (DC) motor-compressors.<br />\r\nThis standard also covers:<br />\r\n– multi-speed
    motor-compressors, that are motor-compressors, the speed of which can be set to
    different values;<br />\r\n– variable capacity motor-compressors that are motor-compressors
    where the capacity of the compressor is controlled at fixed speeds.<br />\r\nExamples
    of equipment which contain motor-compressors are:<br />\r\n– tumble dryers (IEC
    60335-2-11);<br />\r\n– refrigerating appliances, ice-cream appliances and ice-makers
    (IEC 60335-2-24);<br />\r\n– electrical heat pumps, air-conditioners and dehumidifiers
    (IEC 60335-2-40);<br />\r\n– commercial dispensing appliances and vending machines
    (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n– commercial refrigerating appliances and ice-makers
    with an incorporated or remote refrigerant unit or compressor (IEC 60335-2-89);<br
    />\r\n– refrigerating equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use (IEC
    61010-2-011);<br />\r\n– professional ice-cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118);<br />\r\n–
    professional systems and heat pumps (ISO 5149-2);<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not supersede the requirements of standards relevant to the particular appliance
    in which the motor-compressor is used. However, if the motor-compressor type used
    complies with this standard, it will not be necessary for the tests for the motor-compressor
    specified in the particular appliance standard to be made in the particular appliance
    or assembly. If the motor-compressor control system is associated with the particular
    appliance control system, additional tests could be necessary on the end product.<br
    />\r\nSo far as is practical, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by motor-compressors used in appliances which are encountered by all persons in
    and around the home. However, it does not in general take into account:<br />\r\n–
    the use of appliances by young children or infirm persons without supervision;<br
    />\r\n– playing with the appliances by young children.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn
    to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for motor-compressors intended to be used in appliances
    in vehicles or on board ships, additional requirements could be necessary;<br
    />\r\n– motor-compressors used in appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas), additional require¬ments could be necessary;<br
    />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n–
    motor-compressors designed exclusively for industrial purposes.<br />\r\nThis
    seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2021. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) in the scope added the rating up
    to 600 V (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) the definition of design pressure has been changed
    in maximum allowable pressure (3.1.101, 7.102, 22.7);<br />\r\nd) introduction
    of maximum load conditions (MLC) as declared by the manufacturer (3.1.103, 5.6,
    7.12, Annex AA);<br />\r\ne) transcritical back pressure categories (R-744) have
    been introduced (3.1.102, Table AA.1, Table AA.2);<br />\r\nf) new definition
    of coilette has been introduced (3.8.103);<br />\r\ng) new definition of bypass
    valve has been introduced (3.8.104);<br />\r\nh) the evaluation of motor-compressors
    using a motor-compressor control system has been clarified (6.101, 6.103, 6.104,
    19.1);<br />\r\ni) modification of electric strength test has been added (16.2);<br
    />\r\nj) reference to the fatigue test has been deleted (Clause 18);<br />\r\nk)
    compliance for pressure tests has been updated (22.7, Annex EE);<br />\r\nl) reference
    for the motorette has been transferred from Annex BB to the new Annex FF;<br />\r\nm)
    annex for insulation materials and parts has been updated and tie cord relaxation
    has been removed (Annex CC);<br />\r\nn) new annex for motorette or coilette has
    been introduced (Annex FF).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
