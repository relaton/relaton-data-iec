abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-3:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC/IEEE 62582-3:2024 contains
    methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials in instrumentation
    and control systems using tensile elongation techniques in the detail necessary
    to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. This document includes the
    requirements for the selection of samples, the measurement system and conditions,
    and the reporting of the measurement results. The different parts of IEC/IEEE
    62582 are measurement standards, primarily for use in the management of ageing
    in initial qualification and after installation. IEC/IEEE 62582-1 includes requirements
    for the application of the other parts of IEC/IEEE 62582 and some elements which
    are common to all methods. This document applies to non-energised equipment. This
    document is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo standard. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2012.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Updated best practices relating to condition monitoring using the tensile elongation
    method.<br />\r\nb) Updated bibliography, references and context.</p>"
