  content: "IEC 62148-15:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62148-15:2021
    covers the physical dimension and interface specifications for discrete vertical
    cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) devices in optical telecommunication and
    optical data transmission applications. The intent of this document is to adequately
    specify the physical requirements of VCSEL devices that will enable mechanical
    interchangeability of laser devices or transmitters complying with this document
    both at the printed circuit wiring board and for any panel-mounting requirement.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2014.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    the classification of optical/electrical interface types is generalized and referred
    to IEC 62148-1;<br />\r\n- a new pin mode is added to Table 1;<br />\r\n- several
    dimensions of the VCSEL TO CAN package are changed in Table 3 to reflect the current
    state of technology;<br />\r\n- Figure 7 is updated to show the complete details
    of the VCSEL TOSA package."
