  content: "IEC 62341-6-3:2017(E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measuring methods for determining the image quality of organic light emitting
    diode (OLED) display panels and modules.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the measuring method for viewing
    angle has been modified. Measurement of the half luminance angle, gamma distortion,
    and directional colour variation is added;<br />\r\nb) measurement method for
    colour characteristics is added;<br />\r\nc) additional explanation is added in
    static image resolution clause;<br />\r\nd) moving image resolution clause has
    been moved to Annex B.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of October 2019
    have been included in this copy."
