abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TS 24748-6:2016<p>- specifies activities and processes to be implemented
    for engineering the integration of systems-of-interest throughout the life cycle
    (systems made of products and/or services; see Note 1),</p><p>- provides guidance
    for the integration process and its relationships to other system life cycle processes
    as described in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288,</p><p>- specifies the information items to
    be produced through the implementation of the integration engineering (integration
    process and its relationships to other system life cycle processes),</p><p>- specifies
    the contents of the information items, and</p><p>- provides guidelines for the
    format of the information items.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 24748-6:2016 can be applied
    to</p><p>- those who use or plan to use ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 on projects dealing
    with man-made systems, software-intensive systems, products and services related
    to those systems, regardless of project scope, methodology, size or complexity,
    and</p><p>- anyone performing integration engineering activities to aid in ensuring
    that the application of the integration process and its relationships to other
    system life cycle processes conform to ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.</p>
