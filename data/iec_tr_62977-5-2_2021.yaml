abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62977-5-2:2021, which is a Technical Report, describes the visual
    assessment method of the viewing direction characteristics of display devices.
    This document reviews the visual assessment of viewing direction by using special
    test patterns to estimate colour changes, image structure, and image luminance.<br
    />\r\nExperimental results are shown to reveal the effectiveness of this kind
    of visual assessment.<br />\r\nThis method is a valuable tool for identifying
    image quality issues, but physical measurements will be used to confirm display
    performance specifications.<br />\r\nNOTE The visual assessment results will depend
    on the test pattern parameters and display setup conditions. As the viewing direction
    changes, characteristics such as contrast ratio, resolution, and device colour-shift
    simultaneously change in the perceived image."
