abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 15444-4:2004 specifies the framework, concepts, methodology for
    testing, and criteria to be achieved to claim compliance with ISO/IEC 15444-1.
    It provides a framework for specifying abstract test suites and for defining the
    procedures to be followed during compliance testing.ISO/IEC 15444-4:2004:Specifies
    compliance testing procedures for encoding and decoding using JPEG 2000 Part 1
    (ISO/IEC 15444-1);Specifies codestreams, decoded images and error metrics to be
    used with the testing procedures;Specifies abstract test suites; andProvides guidance
    for creating an encoder compliance test.ISO/IEC 15444-4:2004 does not include
    the following tests:Acceptance testing: the process of determining whether an
    implementation satisfies acceptance criteria and enables the user to determine
    whether or not to accept the implementation. This includes the planning and execution
    of several kinds of tests (e.g. functionality, quality and speed performance testing)
    that demonstrate the implementation satisfies the user requirements.Performance
    testing: measuring the performance characteristics of an Implementation Under
    Test (IUT), such as its throughput, responsiveness, etc., under various conditions.Robustness
    testing: the process of determining how well an implementation processes data
    which contains errors.'
