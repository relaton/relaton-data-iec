- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-66:2025 EXV and IEC 60335-2-66:2025 RLV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-66:2025 deals with the safety of electric water-bed heaters
    and their associated control units, for household and similar purposes, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V, including direct current (DC) supplied
    appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use, but that
    nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended
    to be used in hotels, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as
    is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n–
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or in
    aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries,
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to appliances<br />\r\n– for medical purposes (IEC 60601 series);<br />\r\n– intended
    for immersion in water during use.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1: 2008 and Amendment 2:2011.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1, 19.4, 22.101);<br />\r\nc) clarification of requirements
    for remote operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
