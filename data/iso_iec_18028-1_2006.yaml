abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18028-1:2006 provides detailed guidance on the security aspects
    of the management, operation and use of information technology (IT) networks,
    and their interconnections.</p><p>It defines and describes the concepts associated
    with, and provides management guidance on, network security - including on how
    to identify and analyse the communications-related factors to be taken into account
    to establish network security requirements, with an introduction to the possible
    control areas and the specific technical areas (dealt with in subsequent parts
    of ISO/IEC 18028). It is relevant to anyone who owns, operates or uses a network.
    This includes senior managers and other non-technical managers or users, in addition
    to managers and administrators who have specific responsibilities for information
    security and/or network security, network operation, or who are responsible for
    an organization's overall security programme and security policy development.</p><p>The
    general objective of ISO/IEC 18028 is to extend the security management guidelines
    provided in ISO/IEC TR 13335 and ISO/IEC 17799 by detailing the specific operations
    and mechanisms needed to implement network security controls in a wider range
    of network environments, providing a bridge between general IT security management
    issues and network security technical implementations.</p>"
