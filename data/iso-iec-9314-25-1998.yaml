  content: 'The Station Management (SMT) Abstract Test Suite (ATS) directly supports
    the FDDI Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement (PICS) Proforma and works
    in correlation with three other FDDI ATS standards. This ATS for FDDI SMT provides
    the test procedures and test cases required to test the station management protocol
    described in the SMT standards. SMT specified the local portion of the system
    management application process for FDDI, including the control required for proper
    operation of an FDDI station in an FDDI ring. SMT provided services such as connection
    management, station insertion and removal, station initialization, configuration
    management, fault recovery, communication protocol for external authority, scheduling
    policies and the collection of statistics. SMT interact with PMD, PHY, and MAC
    for testing. (NOTE: This publication is NOT available in paper form; it is available
    on CD-ROM.)'
