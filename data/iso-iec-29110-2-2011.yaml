    <p>A Very Small Entity (VSE) is defined as an enterprise, organization, department or project having up to 25 people. A set of standards and guides have been developed according to a set of VSEs' characteristics and needs. The guides are based on subsets of appropriate standards elements, referred to as VSE profiles. The purpose of a VSE profile is to define a subset of International Standards relevant to the VSE context.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110 is targeted by audience. ISO/IEC 29110-2:2011 is targeted for standards producers, tool vendors and methodology vendors. It is not intended for VSEs. It introduces the concepts for software engineering International Standardized Profiles for VSEs, and defines the terms common to ISO/IEC 29110. It establishes the logic behind the definition and application of standardized profiles. It specifies the elements common to all standardized profiles (structure, conformance, assessment) and introduces the taxonomy (catalogue) of ISO/IEC 29110 profiles.</p>
