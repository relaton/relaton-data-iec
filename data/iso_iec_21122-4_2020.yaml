abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the framework, concepts, methodology for testing,
    and criteria to be achieved to claim conformance to multiple parts of the ISO/IEC
    21122 series. It lists the conformance testing procedures.</p><p>This document
    specifies:</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures for decoders implementing ISO/IEC
    21122-1.</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures for decoders implementing ISO/IEC
    21122-3.</p><p>— Tests to check codestreams for conformance to ISO/IEC 21122-1.
    As such, it provides means to test whether encoder implementations generate syntactically
    correct codestreams, and whether codestreams generated by such implementations
    follow the requirements of a particular profile, level and sublevel, and the buffer
    model implied by them.</p><p>— Tests to check files for conformance to ISO/IEC
    21122-3.</p><p>— Conformance testing procedures that allow testing whether codestreams
    conform to any of the profiles specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2.</p><p>— Conformance
    testing procedures that allow testing whether codestreams conform to the buffer
    model specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2 as part of a profile, level and sublevel.</p><p>—
    Codestreams, decoded images, and error metrics to be used within the decoder testing
    procedures.</p><p>— A buffer model test.</p><p>— Abstract test suites.</p><p>This
    document does not specify:</p><p>— Testing the reconstruction of a full resolution
    image from a subsampled image format. In particular, upsampling from 4:2:2 to
    4:4:4 sampling is a non-normative extension and as such its testing is beyond
    the scope of this document.</p><p>— Testing the conversion of the sample values
    reconstructed by an ISO/IEC 21122-3 decoder to the target colour space by means
    of the colour specification box of ISO/IEC 21122-3.</p><p>— Testing of the composition
    of background and foreground for images reconstructed from ISO/IEC 21122-3 files
    or codestreams.</p><p>— Acceptance testing: the process of determining whether
    an implementation satisfies acceptance criteria and enables the user to determine
    whether or not to accept the implementation. This includes the planning and execution
    of several kinds of tests (e.g. functionality, quality, and speed performance
    testing) that demonstrate that the implementation satisfies the user requirements.</p><p>—
    Performance testing: measures the performance characteristics of an implementation
    under test (IUT) such as its throughput, responsiveness, etc. under various conditions.</p><p>—
    Robustness testing: the process of determining how well an implementation is able
    to conceal problems from attempting to reconstruct an image from an ill-formed
    codestream.</p>"
