abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the framework, concepts, methodology for testing,
    and criteria to be achieved to claim conformance to multiple parts of the ISO/IEC
    21122 series. It lists the conformance testing procedures.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies:<br />\r\n- Conformance testing procedures for decoders implementing
    ISO/IEC 21122-1.<br />\r\n- Conformance testing procedures for decoders implementing
    ISO/IEC 21122-3.<br />\r\n- Tests to check codestreams for conformance to ISO/IEC
    21122-1. As such, it provides means to test whether encoder implementations generate
    syntactically correct codestreams, and whether codestreams generated by such implementations
    follow the requirements of a particular profile, level and sublevel, and the buffer
    model implied by them.<br />\r\n- Tests to check files for conformance to ISO/IEC
    21122-3.<br />\r\n- Conformance testing procedures that allow testing whether
    codestreams conform to any of the profiles specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2.<br />\r\n-
    Conformance testing procedures that allow testing whether codestreams conform
    to the buffer model specified in ISO/IEC 21122-2 as part of a profile, level and
    sublevel.<br />\r\n- Codestreams, decoded images, and error metrics to be used
    within the decoder testing procedures.<br />\r\n- A buffer model test.<br />\r\n-
    Abstract test suites.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify:<br />\r\n- Testing
    the reconstruction of a full resolution image from a subsampled image format.
    In particular, upsampling from 4:2:2 to 4:4:4 sampling is a non-normative extension
    and as such its testing is beyond the scope of this document.<br />\r\n- Testing
    the conversion of the sample values reconstructed by an ISO/IEC 21122-3 decoder
    to the target colour space by means of the colour specification box of ISO/IEC
    21122-3.<br />\r\n- Testing of the composition of background and foreground for
    images reconstructed from ISO/IEC 21122-3 files or codestreams.<br />\r\n- Acceptance
    testing: the process of determining whether an implementation satisfies acceptance
    criteria and enables the user to determine whether or not to accept the implementation.
    This includes the planning and execution of several kinds of tests (e.g. functionality,
    quality, and speed performance testing) that demonstrate that the implementation
    satisfies the user requirements.<br />\r\n- Performance testing: measures the
    performance characteristics of an implementation under test (IUT) such as its
    throughput, responsiveness, etc. under various conditions.<br />\r\n- Robustness
    testing: the process of determining how well an implementation is able to conceal
    problems from attempting to reconstruct an image from an ill-formed codestream."
