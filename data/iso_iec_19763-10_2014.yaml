    19763-10:2014 specifies a metamodel framework for interoperability. This part
    of ISO/IEC 19763 specifies the metamodel that provides a facility to register
    administrative information and common semantics of models and mapping between
    two models. ISO/IEC 19763-10:2014 does not specify the metamodel of models in
    a specific language, but provides a common core metamodel for the other parts
    of ISO/IEC 19763, each of which specifies a metamodel for a registry that can
    register models of a specific type, such as ontologies, process models or information
    models, in a number of different languages. ISO/IEC 19763-10:2014 also provides
    a metamodel for registering the mappings between two models registered in those
    other parts of ISO/IEC 19763. ISO/IEC 19763-10:2014 utilises the common facilities
    specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3. ISO/IEC 11179 (all parts) specifies a metadata registry
    (MDR). These common facilities provide the ability to identify and register models
    and their associated model elements and modelling languages within a metadata
    registry used to register models."
