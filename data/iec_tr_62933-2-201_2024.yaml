abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62933-2-201:2024 focuses on the necessity of using repurpose and
    reuse batteries in BESS. This document also illustrates, through case studies
    from various countries, how repurpose and reuse batteries are regulated as per
    legislation. Furthermore, business examples of BESS using repurpose and reuse
    batteries are investigated and issues derived in terms of both the design, manufacturing,
    testing, operation, and maintenance of BESS, considering the anticipated future
    deployment of BESS
