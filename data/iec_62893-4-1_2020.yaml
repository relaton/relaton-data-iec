abstract:
- content: "IEC 62893-4-1:2020 applies to cables for DC charging according to mode
    4 of IEC 61851-1. These cables are not intended to be used with a thermal management
    system such as that specified in IEC 61851-23.<br />\r\nCharging cables specified
    in IEC 62893 (all parts) are intended to be used for electrical appliances of
    class II equipment.<br />\r\nThe maximum conductor operating temperature for the
    cables in this document is 90 °C.<br />\r\nThe test methods specified are given
    in IEC 62893-2, IEC 60245-2, IEC 60332-1-2, IEC 62821‑1:2015, Annex B and in the
    relevant parts of IEC 60811.<br />\r\nIEC 62440 is intended to be used as guidance
