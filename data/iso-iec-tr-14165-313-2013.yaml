  content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165-313:2013(E) defines a set of features necessary to implement
    a real-time fibre channel network (switched fabric or arbitrated loop) supporting
    the FC-AE-ASM Upper Level Protocol. Fibre Channel Avionics Environment is a group
    of protocols and profiles that specify Fibre Channel options for devices connected
    by fabric and&#x2F;or loop topologies that are pertinent to their use in commercial
    and military aerospace industries. The primary areas of interest include avionic
    command, control, instrumentation, simulation, signal processing and sensor&#x2F;video
    data distribution. These application areas are characterized by a variety of requirements,
    among them a need for high reliability, fault tolerance, and deterministic behavior
    to support real-time control&#x2F;response.
