  content: "IEC 60670-22:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60670-22:2024
    applies to boxes, enclosures and parts of enclosures (hereafter called \"boxes\"
    and \"enclosures\") for electrical accessories with a rated voltage not exceeding
    1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC intended for household or similar fixed electrical installations,
    either indoors or outdoors. Boxes and enclosures complying with this document
    are suitable for use at ambient temperatures not normally exceeding +40 °C, but
    their average over a period of 24 h does not exceed +35 °C, with a lower limit
    of the ambient air temperature of −5 °C. Other temperatures outside the above
    range can apply according to the classification of the boxes and the enclosures.
    This document applies to junction connecting boxes or tapping connecting boxes
    or both.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2003 and Amendment 1:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of cable joints as a new type of
    box with the related tests and requirements;<br />\r\nb) addition of tests and
    requirements for boxes and enclosures exposed to direct sunlight with the related
    Annex CC;<br />\r\nc) addition of connecting boxes and enclosures having encapsulation
    capability as a new type of boxes with the related tests, requirements and related
    Annex DD."
