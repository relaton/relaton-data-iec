    describes  the controlled system, its structure and design, its
    behaviour in steady, transient and disturbance state. defines the required control structure. three well-proven configurations of control circuits are
    shown and the field of application of each is given. it also contains  the requirements for
    the measuring elements and actuators which are necessary to complete the control circuits.
