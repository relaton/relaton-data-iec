abstract:
- content: "IEC 61169-54:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61169-54:2021
    provides information and rules for the preparation of detail specifications (DS)
    for coaxial connectors with 10 mm inner diameter of outer conductor, characteristic
    impedance 50 Ω, series 4,3-10 with screw type, hand screw type or quick-lock type
    coupling, for an upper operating frequency limit of 6 GHz, for use in wireless
    telecommunication and wireless network applications in conjunction with appropriate
    transmission line types for these applications. This specification indicates the
    recommended performance characteristics to be considered when writing a detail
    specification and it covers test schedules and inspection requirements for assessment
    levels M and H. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2016. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Table 8: some values changed."
