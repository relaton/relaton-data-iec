  content: "IEC TR 61000-1-7:2016(E) provides definitions of various electrical power
    quantities and the relationship between them under non-sinusoidal conditions,
    in order to give clear information on both components in the power factor:<br
    />\r\n- the fundamental power factor, which is due to the phase difference between
    the voltage and current at the fundamental frequency, and<br />\r\n- the non-fundamental
    power factor, which is related to the distortion of the voltage and/or current.
    This Technical Report is applicable only to single-phase systems."
