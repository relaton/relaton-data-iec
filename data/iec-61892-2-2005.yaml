    This part of IEC 61892 contains provisions for system design of electrical installations in mobile and fixed units used in the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, production, processing and for storage purposes, including pipeline, pumping or 'pigging' stations, compressor stations and exposed location single buoy moorings.
    It applies to all installations, whether permanent, temporary, transportable or hand-held, to a.c. installations up to and including 35 000 V and d.c. installations up to and including 750 V.(a.c. and d.c. voltages are nominal values)
    This standard does not apply either to fixed equipment used for medical purposes or to the electrical installations of tankers.
