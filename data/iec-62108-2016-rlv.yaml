  content: "IEC 62108:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62108:2016 specifies
    the minimum requirements for the design qualification and type approval of concentrator
    photovoltaic (CPV) modules and assemblies suitable for long-term operation in
    general open-air climates as defined in IEC 60721-2-1. The test sequence is partially
    based on that specified in IEC 61215-1. The object of this test standard is to
    determine the electrical, mechanical, and thermal characteristics of the CPV modules
    and assemblies and to show that the CPV modules and assemblies are capable of
    withstanding prolonged exposure in climates described in the scope. This new edition
    includes the following main technical changes with regard to the previous one:<br
    />\r\na) changes in outdoor exposure from 1000 h to 500 h;<br />\r\nb) changes
    in current cycling during thermal cycling test;<br />\r\nc) added dust ingress
    test;<br />\r\nd) eliminated thermal cycling associated with damp heat test;<br
    />\r\ne) eliminated UV exposure test."
