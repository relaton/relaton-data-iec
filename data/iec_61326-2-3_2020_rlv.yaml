abstract:
- content: "IEC 61326-2-3:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61326-2-3:2020
    specifies more detailed test configurations, operational conditions and performance
    criteria for transducers with integrated or remote signal conditioning. This document
    applies only to transducers characterized by their ability to transform, with
    the aid of an auxiliary energy source, a non-electric quantity to a process-relevant
    electrical signal, and to output the signal at one or more PORTS. This document
    includes transducers for electrochemical and biological measured quantities. The
    transducers covered by this document can be powered by AC or DC voltage and/or
    by battery or with internal power supply."
