abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    23360-6-2:2021 This document defines a system interface for compiled applications
    and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts. Its purpose is
    to enable a uniform industry standard environment for high-volume applications
    conforming to the LSB.<br />\r\nThese specifications are composed of two basic
    parts: a common part describing those parts of the interface that remain constant
    across all implementations of the LSB, and an architecture-specific part describing
    the parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture. Together, the
    common part and the relevant architecture-specific part for a single hardware
    architecture provide a complete interface specification for compiled application
    programs on systems that share a common hardware architecture.<br />\r\nThe LSB
    contains both a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Application Binary
    Interfaces (ABIs). APIs may appear in the source code of portable applications,
    while the compiled binary of that application may use the larger set of ABIs.
    A conforming implementation provides all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation
    system may replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or
    more of the underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary interfaces
    as needed.<br />\r\nThe LSB is primarily a binary interface definition. Not all
    of the source level APIs available to applications may be contained in this specification.<br
    />\r\nThis is the PPC64 architecture specific part of the Core module of the Linux
    Standard Base (LSB). This part supplements the common part of the LSB Core module
    with those interfaces that differ between architectures.<br />\r\nThis part should
    be used in conjunction with LSB Core - Generic, the common part. Whenever a section
    of the common part is supplemented by architecture-specific information, the common
    part includes a reference to the architecture-specific part. This part may also
    contain additional information that is not referenced in the common part.<br />\r\nInterfaces
    described in this part of the LSB Core Specification are mandatory except where
    explicitly listed otherwise. Interfaces described in the LSB Core module are supplemented
    by other LSB modules. All other modules depend on the presence of LSB Core."
