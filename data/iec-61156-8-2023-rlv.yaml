  content: "IEC 61156-8:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61156-8:2023
    relates to IEC 61156-1 and IEC 61156-7. The cables described herein are specified
    up to 1 200 MHz and are specifically designed to build work area cords. It covers
    a cable having four individually screened (S/FTP) pairs. The cable can be provided
    with a common screen over the cable core. The cables covered by this sectional
    specification are intended to operate with voltages and currents normally encountered
    in communication systems and support the delivery of DC low voltage remote powering
    applications. These cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low
    impedance sources, for example the electric power supply of public utility mains.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009,
    and Amendment 1:2013. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. align clauses with IEC
    61156-1:2023;<br />\r\nb. additional reference to IEC 62153-4-9 test method (triaxial)
    for coupling attenuation measurement to be consistent with all other parts of
    the IEC 61156 series;<br />\r\nc. incorporation of blank detail specification.\r\n<div
