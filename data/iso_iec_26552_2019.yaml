abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document, within the context
    of methods and tools for architecture design for software and systems product
    lines:</p><p>— defines processes and their subprocesses performed during domain
    and application architecture design. Those processes are described in terms of
    purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;</p><p>— defines method capabilities to support
    the defined tasks of each process;</p><p>— defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate
    tasks or defined method capabilities.</p><p>This document does not concern processes
    and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with
    those for a family of products.</p>
