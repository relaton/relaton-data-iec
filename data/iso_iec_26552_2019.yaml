abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26552:2019 This document, within the context of methods and tools
    for architecture design for software and systems product lines:<br />\r\n- defines
    processes and their subprocesses performed during domain and application architecture
    design. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;<br
    />\r\n- defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;<br
    />\r\n- defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method
    capabilities.<br />\r\nThis document does not concern processes and capabilities
    of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family
    of products."
