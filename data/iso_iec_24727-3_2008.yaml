abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between
    integrated circuit cards (ICCs) and external applications to include generic services
    for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to
    ISO/IEC 7816-4.ISO/IEC 24727 is relevant to ICC applications desiring interoperability
    among diverse application domains.ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 defines services as representations
    of action requests and action responses to be supported at the client-application
    service interface. The services are described in a programming language independent
    way.ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 is the application interface of the Open Systems Interconnection
    Reference Model defined in ISO/IEC 7498-1. It provides a high-level interface
    for a client-application making use of information storage and processing operations
    of a card-application as viewed on the generic card interface.ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008
    does not mandate a specific implementation methodology for this interface.
