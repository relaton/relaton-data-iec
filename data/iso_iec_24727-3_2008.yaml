abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24727 is a set of programming interfaces for interactions between
    integrated circuit cards (ICCs) and external applications to include generic services
    for multi-sector use. The organization and the operation of the ICC conform to
    ISO/IEC 7816-4.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24727 is relevant to ICC applications desiring interoperability
    among diverse application domains.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 defines services
    as representations of action requests and action responses to be supported at
    the client-application service interface. The services are described in a programming
    language independent way.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 is the application interface
    of the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model defined in ISO/IEC 7498-1.
    It provides a high-level interface for a client-application making use of information
    storage and processing operations of a card-application as viewed on the generic
    card interface.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24727-3:2008 does not mandate a specific implementation
    methodology for this interface.</p>"
