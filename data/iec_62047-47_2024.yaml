abstract:
- content: "IEC 62047-47:2024 specifies the requirements and testing method to measure
    the bending strength of microstructures which are fabricated by micromachining
    technology used in silicon-based micro-electromechanical system (MEMS).<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to the in-situ bending strength measurement of microstructures
    manufactured by microelectronic technology process and other micromachining technology.<br
    />\r\nWith the devices scaling, the bending strength degradation, induced by defects
    and contaminations, becomes more severe. This document specifies an in-situ testing
    method of the bending strength based on MEMS technique. This document does not
    need intricate instruments (such as scanning probe microscopy and nanoindenter)
    and special test specimens.<br />\r\nSince in-situ on-chip tester in this document
    and device are fabricated with the same process on the same wafer, this document
    can give some practical reference for the design part."
