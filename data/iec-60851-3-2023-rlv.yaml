  content: "IEC 60851-3:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60851-3:
    2023 specifies the following test methods for winding wires:<br />\r\n- Test 6:
    Elongation;<br />\r\n- Test 7: Springiness;<br />\r\n- Test 8: Flexibility and
    adherence;<br />\r\n- Test 11: Resistance to abrasion;<br />\r\n- Test 18: Heat
    bonding.<br />\r\nFor definitions, general notes on test methods and the complete
    series of test methods for winding wires, IEC 60851-1 applies. This document also
    provides recommended friction test methods in Annex B. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2009, Amendment 1:2013 and Amendment
    2:2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) Clarification of the distance measurement for determining loss of adhesion
    in 6.6.3, 6.6.4 for fibre-covered wires and 6.6.5 for tape-wrapped wires."
