abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format and associated system requirements
    for volume and boot block recognition,</p><p>volume structure, file structure
    and record structure for the interchange of information on media between users
    of</p><p>information processing systems.</p><p>The media shall be recorded as
    if the recording of sectors may be done in any order.</p><p>Note 1 - The medium
    is not restricted to being of only one type; the type of medium may be either
    write once, or read only, or</p><p>rewritable, or a combination of these types.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    13346 consists of the following five Parts:</p><p>Part 1: General</p><p>Part 2:
    Volume and Boot Block Recognition</p><p>Part 3: Volume Structure</p><p>Part 4:
    File Structure</p><p>Part 5: Record Structure</p><p>Annex A - ICB Strategies,
    is part of ISO/IEC 13346-4.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 13346 specifies a format
    and associated system requirements for volume structure by</p><p>specifying:</p><p>
    the attributes of a volume and the descriptors recorded on it;</p><p> the relationship
    among volumes of a volume set;</p><p> the attributes of a partition of a volume;</p><p>
    the attributes of a logical volume and the descriptors recorded on it;</p><p>
    levels of medium interchange;</p><p> requirements for the processes which are
    provided within information processing systems, to enable</p><p>information to
    be interchanged between different systems; for this purpose, it specifies the
    functions to be</p><p>provided within systems which are intended to originate
    or receive media which conform to this part of</p><p>ISO/IEC 13346.</p>"
