  content: This technical report applies to equipment interfaces. These interfaces
    within the equipment may be connected to telecommunications networks, they may
    form part of the telecommunications network infrastructure or they may provide
    localized transfer of data. This technical report provides guidance on the classification
    of interfaces in accordance with the circuit types defined in IEC 60950 following
    an analysis of the telecommunication network characteristics.
