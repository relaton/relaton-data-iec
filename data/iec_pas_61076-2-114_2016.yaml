abstract:
- content: 'IEC PAS 61076-2-114:2016(E) describes circular connectors with M8 screw-locking
    typically used for data transmissions in industrial applications. These connectors
    consist of fixed and free connectors either rewireable or non-rewireable, with
    M8 screw-locking. Male connectors have round contacts with a diameter of 0,8 mm.
    The coding provided by this PAS prevents the mating of accordingly coded male
    or female connectors to any other similarly sized interfaces covered by other
    standards. Keywords: Circular connector, Screw-locking, M8'
