abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 22954:2022 This document specifies a method of automated colour
    profile distribution to large format inkjet printers.<br />\r\nThis document applies
    to digital colour printers and their printer controllers for which ICC colour
    management is necessary or desired. This document also applies to the print settings
    profile providers.<br />\r\nThe extent of automation covered includes the printer
    controller acquiring information about the overall situation, connecting to a
    print settings profile provider on the Internet, determining the best possible
    profile to download (if it exists), and downloading and installation of the profile.<br
    />\r\nThis document covers general concepts and procedures and does not go into
    a level of detail necessary to establish syntactic or semantic interoperability.
    This document covers ICC version 4 output profiles as specified by ISO 15076-1,
    but does not cover device link profiles."
