abstract:
- content: "<p>This Recommendation | International Standard defines a set of lossless
    (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding bi-level, continuous-tone
    grey-scale, palletized colour, or continuous-tone colour digital still images.</p><p>This
    Recommendation | International Standard:</p><p>? specifies decoding processes
    for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;</p><p>? specifies
    a codestream syntax containing information for interpreting the compressed image
    data;</p><p>? specifies a file format;</p><p>? provides guidance on encoding processes
    for converting source image data to compressed image data;</p><p>? provides guidance
    on how to implement these processes in practice.</p><p>NOTE? As this specification
    was first published as common text only after ISO/IEC JTC1 had approved the first
    edition in 2000, edition numbers in the ITU and ISO/IEC versions are offset by
    one. This is the third edition of ITU-T T.800 and the fourth edition of ISO/IEC
    15444-1.</p>"
