abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-14:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60384-14:2023 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60384-14:2013+AMD1:2016
    CSV edition 4.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 40 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60384-14:2023 applies to capacitors and resistor-capacitor
    combinations intended to be connected to AC mains or other supply with a nominal
    voltage not exceeding 1 000 V AC (RMS), and with a nominal frequency not exceeding
    100 Hz. This document includes also additional specific conditions and requirements
    for the connection to DC supplies with a rated voltage not exceeding 1 500 V DC.
    The principal object of this part of IEC 60384 is to prescribe preferred ratings
    and characteristics and to select, from IEC 60384-1, the appropriate quality assessment
    procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general performance requirements
    for this type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements prescribed in detail
    specifications referring to this sectional specification are of equal or higher
    performance level; lower performance levels are not permitted. This document also
    provides a schedule of safety tests to be used by national testing stations in
    countries where approval by such stations is required. The overvoltage categories
    in combination with the AC mains voltages for the capacitors classified in this
    document are to be taken from IEC 60664-1. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tin
    damp heat steady state test, all capacitor types are tested both with and without
    rated voltage; the number of test pieces has been increased;\r\n\ttangent of loss
    angle is added In Group 0 tests, in safety tests only;\r\n\tqualification approval
    based on safety and performance tests has been removed from the main text to a
    normative annex;\r\n\tthe range of rated voltages is given instead of exact rated
    voltage values;\r\n\tnormative annex for description of capacitor styles and of
    creepage/clearance distance measurement has been added;\r\n\tthe importance of
    mechanical failures (cracks) in component encapsulation as a safety feature is
    highlighted in handling instructions and requirements after all relevant tests."
