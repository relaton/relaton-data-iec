abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 8825-4:2015 specifies a set of basic XML Encoding Rules (BASIC-XER)
    that may be used to derive a transfer syntax for values of types defined in Rec.
    ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824-1 and Rec. ITU-T X.681 | ISO/IEC 8824-2. This Recommendation
    | International Standard also specifies a set of Canonical XML Encoding Rules
    (CXER) which provide constraints on the basic XML Encoding Rules and produce a
    unique encoding for any given ASN.1 value. This Recommendation | International
    Standard further specifies a set of extended XML Encoding Rules (EXTENDED-XER)
    which adds further encoders options, and also allows the ASN.1 specifier to vary
    the encoding that would be produced by BASIC-XER. It is implicit in the specification
    of these encoding rules that they are also used for decoding.<p>The encoding rules
    specified in this Recommendation | International Standard:</p><p>- are used at
    the time of communication;</p><p>- are intended for use in circumstances where
    displaying of values and/or processing them using commonly available XML tools
    (such as browsers) is the major concern in the choice of encoding rules;</p><p>-
    allow the extension of an abstract syntax by addition of extra values for all
    forms of extensibility described in Rec. ITU-T X.680 | ISO/IEC 8824â€‘1.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    8825-4:2015 also specifies the syntax and semantics of XER encoding instructions,
    and the rules for their assignment and combination. XER encoding instructions
    can be used to control the EXTENDED-XER encoding for specific ASN.1 types.</p>
