abstract:
- content: "This document gives guidelines for information security incident response
    in ICT security operations. This document does this by firstly covering the operational
    aspects in ICT security operations from a people, processes and technology perspective.
    It then further focuses on information security incident response in ICT security
    operations including information security incident detection, reporting, triage,
    analysis, response, containment, eradication, recovery and conclusion.<br />\r\nThis
    document is not concerned with non-ICT incident response operations such as loss
    of paper-based documents.<br />\r\nThis document is based on the \"Detection and
    reporting\" phase, the \"Assessment and decision\" phase and the \"Responses\"
    phase of the \"Information security incident management phases\" model presented
    in ISO/IEC 27035â€‘1:2016.<br />\r\nThe principles given in this document are generic
    and intended to be applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size or
    nature. Organizations can adjust the provisions given in this document according
    to their type, size and nature of business in relation to the information security
    risk situation.<br />\r\nThis document is also applicable to external organizations
    providing information security incident management services."
