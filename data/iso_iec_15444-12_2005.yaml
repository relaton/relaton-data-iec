abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 15444-12:2005 specifies the structure and uses of the ISO base
    media file format. The identical text is published as ISO/IEC 14496-12:2005. This
    file format is used to contain time-based media such as video and audio. The storage
    of particular coding schemes is defined in specifications that derive from and
    reference ISO/IEC 14496-12:2005 and ISO/IEC 15444-12:2005, such as the MPEG-4
    file format specified in ISO/IEC 14496-14, or the Motion JPEG file format specified
    in ISO/IEC 15444-3.</p><p>This file format is designed to contain timed media
    information for a presentation in a flexible, extensible format that facilitates
    interchange, management, editing and presentation of the media. This presentation
    may be "local" to the system containing the presentation, or may be via a network
    or other stream delivery mechanism. The file format is designed to be independent
    of any particular network protocol while enabling efficient support for them in
    general.</p><p>The file structure is object-oriented; a file can be decomposed
    into constituent objects very simply, and the structure of the objects inferred
    directly from their type.</p><p>This technically identical text is published as
    ISO/IEC 14496-12:2005 for MPEG-4, and as ISO/IEC 15444-12:2005 for JPEG 2000,
    and reference to this specification should be made accordingly. The recommendation
    is to reference one, for example ISO/IEC 14496-12:2005, and append to the reference
    a parenthetical comment identifying the other, for example "(technically identical
    to ISO/IEC 15444-12:2005)".</p><p>This version adds various new tools, including
    those for content protection, better support of metadata, and better support for
    advanced coding.</p>
