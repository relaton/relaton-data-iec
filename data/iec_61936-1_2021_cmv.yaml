abstract:
- content: "IEC 61936-1:2021 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61936-1:2021 CMV edition 3.0 and the previous IEC
    61936-1:2010+AMD1:2014 CSV edition 2.1. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 99 experts
    are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    61936-1:2021 provides requirements for the design and the erection of electrical
    power installations in systems with nominal voltages exceeding 1 kV AC and nominal
    frequency up to and including 60 Hz, so as to provide safety and proper functioning
    for the use intended.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to the design and
    erection of any of the following:<br />\r\n– overhead and underground lines between
    separate electrical power installations;<br />\r\n– electrified railway tracks
    and rolling stock;<br />\r\n– mining equipment and installations;<br />\r\n– fluorescent
    lamp installations;<br />\r\n– installations on ships according to IEC 60092 (all
    parts) and offshore units according to IEC 61892 (all parts), which are used in
    the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, processing and storage purposes;<br
    />\r\n– electrostatic equipment (e.g. electrostatic precipitators, spray-painting
    units);<br />\r\n– test sites;<br />\r\n– medical equipment, e.g. medical X-ray
    equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to the design of prefabricated,
    type-tested switchgear and high voltage/low voltage prefabricated substation,
    for which separate IEC standards exist.<br /><br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\nintroduction has been rewritten to reflect the status when this document
    is produced;<br />\r\nthe scope has been improved to clarify the application of
    this document;<br />\r\nmissing and obsolete terms and definitions have been updated
    including improvement of existing terms;<br />\r\nTable 1 has been updated where
    agreements between supplier and user are needed;<br />\r\nrequirements of electromagnetic
    compatibility have been clarified;<br />\r\ninsulation coordination clause (Clause
    5) has improved wording for better clarity and the technical content has an updated
    coordination to the latest versions of the insulation coordination standards;<br
    />\r\nwording regarding electrical equipment has been improved and made clearer;<br
    />\r\nsubclause for fuses has been improved and reworded;<br />\r\nrequirements
    have been added for labelling when multiple sources are required to be disconnected;<br
    />\r\nmissing requirements for GIS have been reintroduced;<br />\r\nsubclause
    regarding ventilation (HVAC) has been improved;<br />\r\nfigures in Clause 7 have
    been updated and moved to the corresponding subclause;<br />\r\nrequirements for
    transformer installations have been improved including adjustment of editorial
    typing-errors;<br />\r\nclause on protection, automation and auxiliary systems
    has been restructured and improved;<br />\r\nprotection against lightning strokes
    has been extended;<br />\r\nclarification of content due to the distinction between
    erection (and providing electrical safety for the intended use of the electrical
    power installation) and subsequent activities such as maintenance and repair with
    safe working procedures;<br />\r\nwhere no provincial, national or regional regulations
    are available for safe working procedures, an informative guideline is provided
    in Annex F. This replaces the former parts of Figure 3 in Clause 7."
