- content: "IEC 61936-1:2021 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61936-1:2021 CMV edition 3.0 and the previous IEC
    61936-1:2010+AMD1:2014 CSV edition 2.1. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 99 experts
    are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    61936-1:2021 provides requirements for the design and the erection of electrical
    power installations in systems with nominal voltages exceeding 1 kV AC and nominal
    frequency up to and including 60 Hz, so as to provide safety and proper functioning
    for the use intended.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to the design and
    erection of any of the following:<br />\r\n– overhead and underground lines between
    separate electrical power installations;<br />\r\n– electrified railway tracks
    and rolling stock;<br />\r\n– mining equipment and installations;<br />\r\n– fluorescent
    lamp installations;<br />\r\n– installations on ships according to IEC 60092 (all
    parts) and offshore units according to IEC 61892 (all parts), which are used in
    the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, processing and storage purposes;<br
    />\r\n– electrostatic equipment (e.g. electrostatic precipitators, spray-painting
    units);<br />\r\n– test sites;<br />\r\n– medical equipment, e.g. medical X-ray
    equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to the design of prefabricated,
    type-tested switchgear and high voltage/low voltage prefabricated substation,
    for which separate IEC standards exist.<br /><br />\r\nThis edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\tintroduction
    has been rewritten to reflect the status when this document is produced;\r\n\tthe
    scope has been improved to clarify the application of this document;\r\n\tmissing
    and obsolete terms and definitions have been updated including improvement of
    existing terms;\r\n\tTable 1 has been updated where agreements between supplier
    and user are needed;\r\n\trequirements of electromagnetic compatibility have been
    clarified;\r\n\tinsulation coordination clause (Clause 5) has improved wording
    for better clarity and the technical content has an updated coordination to the
    latest versions of the insulation coordination standards;\r\n\twording regarding
    electrical equipment has been improved and made clearer;\r\n\tsubclause for fuses
    has been improved and reworded;\r\n\trequirements have been added for labelling
    when multiple sources are required to be disconnected;\r\n\tmissing requirements
    for GIS have been reintroduced;\r\n\tsubclause regarding ventilation (HVAC) has
    been improved;\r\n\tfigures in Clause 7 have been updated and moved to the corresponding
    subclause;\r\n\trequirements for transformer installations have been improved
    including adjustment of editorial typing-errors;\r\n\tclause on protection, automation
    and auxiliary systems has been restructured and improved;\r\n\tprotection against
    lightning strokes has been extended;\r\n\tclarification of content due to the
    distinction between erection (and providing electrical safety for the intended
    use of the electrical power installation) and subsequent activities such as maintenance
    and repair with safe working procedures;\r\n\twhere no provincial, national or
    regional regulations are available for safe working procedures, an informative
    guideline is provided in Annex F. This replaces the former parts of Figure 3 in
    Clause 7."
