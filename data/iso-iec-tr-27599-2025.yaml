  content: "ISO/IEC TR 27599:2025 provides a collection of representative use cases
    of brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in a variety of domains: proposed
    medical and health, industrial controls, smart environment, etc.<br />\r\nThis
    technical report can be used for the development of potential standards, and it
    is valuable for a better comprehension of BCI. It is also helpful for BCI industries
    and products that provide support for communications among interested parties
    and stakeholders.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 27599:2025 is applicable to all types of
    organizations (e.g. commercial enterprises, government agencies, not-for-profit
