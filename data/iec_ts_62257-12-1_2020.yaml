abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TS 62257-12-1:2020 is available as  IEC TS 62257-12-1:2020
    RLV  which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<p style=\"text-align:left\">IEC
    TS 62257-12-1:2020 establishes the framework for creating a product specification
    for lamps and lighting appliances to serve as the basis for evaluating quality
    for a particular context. Product specifications include minimum requirements
    for quality standards, warranty requirements, and/or performance criteria. Products
    are compared to specifications based on test results and other information about
    the product. The product specification framework is flexible and can accommodate
    the goals of diverse organizations and institutions. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\n-
    Annex A and Annex B were combined into a single Annex A to eliminate duplicate
    tables and simplify the document.</p>"
