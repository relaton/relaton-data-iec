abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 12207:2008 establishes a common framework for software life cycle
    processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by the software
    industry. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied
    during the acquisition of a software product or service and during the supply,
    development, operation, maintenance and disposal of software products. Software
    includes the software portion of firmware.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 12207:2008 applies
    to the acquisition of systems and software products and services, to the supply,
    development, operation, maintenance, and disposal of software products and the
    software portion of a system, whether performed internally or externally to an
    organization. Those aspects of system definition needed to provide the context
    for software products and services are included.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 12207:2008
    also provides a process that can be employed for defining, controlling, and improving
    software life cycle processes.<br /><br />\r\nThe processes, activities and tasks
    of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 - either alone or in conjunction with ISO/IEC 15288 - may
    also be applied during the acquisition of a system that contains software."
