  content: "IEC TS 62607:2022 establishes a standardized method to determine the key
    control characteristic\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">carrier concentration</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nfor
    semiconducting two-dimensional materials by the\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">field
    effect transistor (FET) method.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nFor semiconducting two-dimensional
    materials, the carrier concentration is evaluated using a field effect transistor
    (FET) test by a measurement of the voltage shift obtained from transfer curve
    upon doping process. The FET test structure consists of three terminals of source,
    drain, and gate where voltage is applied to induce the transistor action. Transfer
    curves are obtained by measuring drain current while applying varied gate voltage
    and constant drain voltage with respect to the source which is grounded."
