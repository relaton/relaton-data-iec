abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    26300:2006 defines an XML schema for office applications and its semantics. The
    schema is suitable for office documents, including text documents, spreadsheets,
    charts and graphical documents like drawings or presentations, but is not restricted
    to these kinds of documents.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 26300:2006 provides for high-level
    information suitable for editing documents. It defines suitable XML structures
    for office documents and is friendly to transformations using XSLT or similar
    XML-based tools.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 26300:2006 first provides an introduction to
    the OpenDocument format and explains the structure of documents that conform to
    the OpenDocument specification. It describes the meta information that can be
    contained in such documents, and their text and paragraph content. Text Fields
    and text indices are described.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 26300:2006 describes the table
    content of a document in OpenDocument format, its graphical content, its chart
    content and its form content. It also describes content that is common to all
    documents. It describes the integration of SMIL animation markup into the OpenDocument
    schema. It explains style information content and specifies formatting properties
    that can be used within styles. The data types used by the OpenDocument schema
    are described. The OpenDocument format makes use of a package concept; these packages
    are described."
