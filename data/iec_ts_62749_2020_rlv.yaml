abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62749:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 62749:2020
    specifies the expected characteristics of electricity at the SUPPLY TERMINALS
    of public low, medium and high voltage, 50 Hz or 60 Hz, networks.<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 The boundaries between the various voltage levels can be different for different
    countries/regions. In the context of this TS, the following terms for system voltage
    are used:<br />\r\n- low voltage (LV) refers to less than or equal to 1 kV;<br
    />\r\n- medium voltage (MV) refers to between 1 kV and 35 kV;<br />\r\n- high
    voltage (HV) refers to between 35 kV and 230 kV.<br />\r\nWhile power quality
    is related to EMC in a number of ways this document is not an EMC publication.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    minimum number of remaining data for weekly analysis,<br />\r\nb) improvement
    of the compatibility between EN 50160 and IEC TS 62749,<br />\r\nc) further explanation
    of the conception of daily sliding window,<br />\r\nd) further explanation of
    the aggregation method used for events,<br />\r\ne) further explanation of the
    relation between Power Quality and EMC,<br />\r\nf) addition of a new definition
    of mains communicating system (MCS),<br />\r\ng) addition of a new Annex G: Other
    phenomena,<br />\r\nh) transfer of the main content of IEC TR 62510 to IEC TS
    62749."
