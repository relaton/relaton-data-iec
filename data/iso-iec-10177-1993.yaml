  content: "<p>Specifies the method by which a network-layer interworking unit (IWU)
    uses the X.25 packet layer protocol to support the OSI connection-mode network
    service. The specification is expressed in terms of a mapping between the network
    internal layer service defined in ISO/IEC 10028 and the virtual call and permanent
    virtual circuit services of the X.25 packet layer protocol. Provides the PICS
    (Protocol Implementation Conformance Statement) proforma in compliance with the
    relevant requirements, and in accordance with the relevant guidance, given in
    ISO/IEC 9646-2.</p>"
