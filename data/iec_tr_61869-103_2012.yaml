abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 61869-103:2012(E) is applicable to inductive and electronic instrument
    transformers for use with electrical measuring instruments for measurement and
    interpretation of results for power quality parameters in 50/60 Hz a.c. power
    supply systems. It gives guidance in the usage of HV instrument transformers for
    measuring the following power quality parameters; power frequency, magnitude of
    the supply voltage and current, flicker, supply voltage dips and swells, voltage
    interruptions, transient voltages, supply voltage unbalance, voltage and current
    harmonics and interharmonics, mains signalling on the supply voltage and rapid
    voltage changes.
