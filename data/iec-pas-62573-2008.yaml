  content: IEC/PAS 62573:2008 specifies the protocol set necessary for RAPIEnet, specifically
    for the data link layer and the application layer, which is mapped on top of the
    data link layer, to exploit the services in accordance with the three-layer fieldbus
    reference model, which is based in part on the OSI Basic Reference Model. Both
    reference models subdivide the area of standardization for interconnection into
    a series of layers of manageable size.
