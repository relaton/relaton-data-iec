abstract:
- content: "IEC 61643-331:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61643-331:2020
    is a test specification for metal oxide varistors (MOV), which are used for applications
    up to 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC in power lines, or telecommunication, or signalling
    circuits. They are designed to protect apparatus or personnel, or both, from high
    transient voltages. This document applies to MOVs having two electrodes and hybrid
    surge protection components. This document also does not apply to mountings and
    their effect on the MOVâ€™s characteristics. Characteristics given apply solely
    to the MOV mounted only in the ways described for the tests. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- a Varistor MCOV rating
    assurance test;<br />\r\n- an energy rating test (2ms);<br />\r\n- revised Dielectric
    strength and insulation resistance tests."
