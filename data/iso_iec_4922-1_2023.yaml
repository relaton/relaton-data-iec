abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 4922-1:2023 This document specifies definitions, terminology and
    processes for secure multiparty computation and related technology, in order to
    establish a taxonomy and enable interoperability. In particular, this document
    defines the processes involved in cryptographic mechanisms which compute a function
    on data while the data are kept private; the participating parties; and the cryptographic
    properties.<br />\r\nThe terminology contained in this document is common to the
    ISO/IEC 4922 series."
