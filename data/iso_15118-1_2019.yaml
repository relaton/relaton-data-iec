abstract:
- content: "ISO 15118-1:2019 This document, as a basis for the other parts of the
    ISO 15118 series, specifies terms and definitions, general requirements and use
    cases for conductive and wireless HLC between the EVCC and the SECC.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to HLC involved in conductive and wireless power transfer
    technologies in the context of manual or automatic connection devices.<br />\r\nThis
    document is also applicable to energy transfer either from EV supply equipment
    to charge the EV battery or from EV battery to EV supply equipment in order to
    supply energy to home, to loads or to the grid.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    a general overview and a common understanding of aspects influencing identification,
    association, charge or discharge control and optimisation, payment, load levelling,
    cybersecurity and privacy. It offers an interoperable EV-EV supply equipment interface
    to all e-mobility actors beyond SECC.<br />\r\nThe ISO 15118 series does not specify
    the vehicle internal communication between battery and other internal equipment
    (beside some dedicated message elements related to the energy transfer).<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 Electric road vehicles specifically are vehicles in categories M (used for carriage
    of passengers) and N (used for carriage of goods) (compare ECE/TR ANS/WP.29/78
    ev.2). This does not prevent vehicles in other categories from adopting the ISO
    15118 series as well.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 This document is destined to orientate the
    message set of ISO 15118‑2 and ISO 15118‑20[1]. The absence of any particular
    use case in this document does not imply that it will not be put into practice,
    with the required messages.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 This document, ISO 15118‑2 and ISO
    15118‑20 are designed to work independent of data transfer medium used. However,
    the ISO 15118 series is made for fitting the specified data link layers in the
    corresponding documents in this series.<br />\r\n[1] Under preparation. Stage
    at the time on publication: ISO/DIS 15118-20:2019."
