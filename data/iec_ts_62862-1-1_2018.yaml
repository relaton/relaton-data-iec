abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62862-1-1:2018(E) contains the main terms and definitions used by
    the solar thermal electric (STE) industry and intends to be a reference for users
    of industry documents. Since the components and configurations of STE plants depend
    on the concentrating solar thermal technology used (i.e., central<em>receiver</em>,<em>parabolic-trough
    collector</em>, parabolic-dish or linear Fresnel<em>concentrator</em>), some terms
    are not applicable to all types of STE plants and notes have been introduced in
    their definitions for clarification.
