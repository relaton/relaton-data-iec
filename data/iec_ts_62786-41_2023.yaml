abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62786-41:2023 (E), which is a Technical Specification, defines
    minimum requirements for frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements
    used to control distributed energy resources (DER) and loads connected to electrical
    power networks.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the characteristics of frequency
    and rate of change of frequency measurements to evaluate their performances. It
    describes the main use cases of frequency and rate of change of frequency measurements,
    with associated level of performances. It describes the principle of functional
    tests to evaluate the specified characteristics and defines the influencing factors
    that affect these performances, under steady state or dynamic conditions.<br />\r\nThis
    document defines the functional requirements applicable to frequency and rate
    of change of frequency measurements which can be inside or outside the DER or
    loads. In the case of DER, this document provides requirements additional to those
    which are defined in the other parts of IEC 62786 or standards produced by the
    relevant IEC technical committees (e.g. TC 82 for photovoltaic systems, TC 88
    for wind systems, TC 120 for electrical energy storage systems (EES)).<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to DER and loads regardless of the voltage level of the
    point of connection to the grid.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify hardware,
    software or a method for frequency or rate of change of frequency measurement.
    It does not specify tests linked to environmental conditions associated with hardware
    devices (climatic, electromagnetic disturbances above 3 kHz, mechanical stress,
    etc.).<br />\r\nFrequency and rate of change of frequency measurements associated
    with time stamping are not in the scope of this document. These measurements are
    already covered by IEC 60255 118 1.<br />\r\nFrequency and rate of change of frequency
    measurements associated with protection functions or protection relays are not
    in the scope of this document. These requirements are already covered by IEC 60255-181."
