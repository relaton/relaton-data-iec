    <p>This International Standard specifies the Authentication supplementary services, which are applicable to various basic</p>
    <p>services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>Authentication of a WTM user (SS-WTAT) is a supplementary service that enables a PISN, as a security measure, to</p>
    <p>validate the identity provided by the WTM user.</p>
    <p>Authentication of the PISN (SS-WTAN) is a supplementary service that enables a served WTM user, as a security</p>
    <p>measure, to validate the identity of the PISN.</p>
    <p>The mechanisms used in these supplementary services are based on the challenge and response method of</p>
    <p>authentication. Authentication algorithms to be used by these two supplementary services (SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN)</p>
    <p>are outside the scope of this International Standard. This International Standard provides the information flows to</p>
    <p>convey the security parameters.</p>
    <p>Supplementary service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT</p>
    <p>Recommendation I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-WTAT and</p>
    <p>SS-WTAN. The stage 1 specification (clause 6 and 7) specifies the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs.</p>
    <p>The stage 2 specification (clause 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary service and the</p>
    <p>information flows between them.</p>
