  content: "IEC 60437:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60437:2023 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60437:1997
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 36 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60437:2023 specifies the procedure for a radio interference
    (RI) test carried out in a laboratory on clean and dry insulators at a frequency
    of 0,5 MHz or 1 MHz or, alternatively, at other frequencies between 0,5 MHz and
    2 MHz.<br />\r\nThis document applies to insulators for use on AC or DC overhead
    power lines and overhead traction lines with a nominal voltage greater than 1
    000 V.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 1997. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 1997. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Composite station post and composite
    hollow core station post insulators have been included;<br />\r\nb) All paragraphs
    of Samples test were actualized;<br />\r\nc) Sample test fast procedure was introduced."
