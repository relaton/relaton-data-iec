  content: "IEC TS 62686-1:2020 defines the minimum requirements for general purpose
    \"off the shelf\" COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) integrated circuits and discrete
    semiconductors for ADHP (aerospace, defence and high performance) applications.
    This Technical Specification applies to all components that can be operated in
    ADHP applications within the manufacturers' publicly available data sheet limits
    in conjunction with IEC TS 62239-1. It may be used by other high performance and
    high reliability industries, at their discretion. This new edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- update related to obsolescence of STACK Specification S/0001 revision
    14 notice 3;<br />\r\n- addition of alternative automotive methods of compliance
    and revision of Annex B initially related to cross-reference to STACK Specification
    S/0001;<br />\r\n- addition of an Annex C to include a requirement matrix for
    IEC TS 62686-1 verification."
