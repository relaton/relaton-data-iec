    IEC 61892-1:2010(E) contains provisions for electrical installations in mobile and fixed offshore units including pipeline, pumping or 'pigging' stations, compressor stations and exposed location single buoy moorings, used in the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, processing and storage purposes. It applies to all installations, whether permanent, temporary, transportable or hand-held, to a.c. installations up to and including 35 000 V and d.c. installations up to and including 1 500 V (a.c. and d.c. voltages are nominal values). It does not apply either to fixed equipment for medical purposes or to the electrical installations of tankers. This edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2001. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    a) the d.c.voltages given in Clause 1, have been updated in order to ensure uniform requirements for all parts of the standard;<br />
    b) the requirement to EMC has been rewritten to comply with the requirements of IEC 61000 2 4;<br />
    c) a clause regarding environmental impact has been added;<br />
    d) Annex A (Guidance on environmental conditions) has been deleted;<br />
    e) Annex B (Informative) regarding cold climate precautions has been added.
