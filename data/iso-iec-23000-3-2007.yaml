    <p>ISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 specifies a solution for digital photo library applications. It standardizes the packaging of images and associated metadata, enabling interoperable exchange across diverse devices and platforms. The supported metadata include image-acquisition parameters (such as date, time and camera settings), as well as MPEG-7 visual content descriptions. This allows conforming devices to support new content-enhanced functionality such as intelligent browsing, content-based search or automatic categorization.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 makes it possible to</p>
    <ul>
    <li>organize photos into categories based on their content - for example, the people and places depicted, or events taking place in photos;</li>
    <li>perform advanced content-based searches through collections of photos;</li>
    <li>bundle photos and favourite ways to show them, into a single MPEG-4 file;</li>
    <li>link to external resources such as other images (outside the MPEG-4 file) or web-pages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The major components of ISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 are</p>
    <ul>
    <li>a method to encapsulate a set of JPEG compressed images in an MPEG-4 file;</li>
    <li>concise subsets of MPEG-7 metadata to describe the individual images and the overall collection;</li>
    <li>a method to embed this binary MPEG-7 metadata in the MPEG-4 file.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23000-3:2007 is a response to the need for persistent and interoperable linking of digital image collections with metadata in order to support advanced access to content. It offers a flexible solution for applications ranging from consumer digital photography to advertising and e-commerce.</p>
