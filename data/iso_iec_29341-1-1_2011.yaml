- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-1-1:2011 The UPnP Device Architecture (formerly known as the DCP Framework).
    It defines the protocols for communication between controllers, or control points,
    and devices. For discovery, description, control, eventing, and presentation,
    the UPnP Device Architecture uses the following protocol stack:<br />\r\n- UPnP
    vendor-specific information;<br />\r\n- information defined by UPnP;<br />\r\n-
    UPnPspecific protocols such as the Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) the
    General Event Notification Architecture (GENA) and the multicast event protocol
    defined in this document, and others that are referenced. SSDP is delivered via
    either multicast or unicast UDP. Multicast events are delivered via multicast
    UDP. GENA is delivered via HTTP. Ultimately, all messages above are delivered
    over IP. The remaining clauses of this document describe the content and format
    for each of these protocol layers in detail."
