abstract:
- content: ISO 11553-2:2007 specifies the requirements for laser processing devices,
    as defined in ISO 11553-1, which are hand-held or hand-operated. The purpose of
    ISO 11553-2:2007 is to draw attention to the particular hazards related to the
    use of hand-held laser and hand-operated laser processing devices and to prevent
    personal injury. This includes both the areas of hazard analysis and risk assessment
    as well as protective measures.
