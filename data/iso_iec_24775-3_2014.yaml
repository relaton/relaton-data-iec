abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24775-3:2014() defines profiles that are supported by profiles
    defined in the other parts of the ISO/IEC 24775 series. The first few clauses
    provide background material that helps explain the purpose and profiles and recipes
    (a subset of a profile). Common port profiles are grouped together since they
    serve as transport-specific variations of a common model. The port profiles are
    followed by other common profiles. Clause 50 presents recipes that span multiple
    profiles. This International Standard, together with ISO/IEC 24775-1, ISO/IEC
    24775-2 and ISO/IEC 24775-4 to ISO/IEC 24775-8, replaces ISO/IEC 24775, second
    edition, published in 2011, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- reorganization into eight parts;<br />\r\n- maturity identification
    using stages;<br />\r\n- and new profiles."
