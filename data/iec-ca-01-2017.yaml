  content: IEC CA 01:2017 provides a framework and sets out the basic rules for the
    structure and operation of the IEC CA Systems. This harmonized set of rules ensures
    that the Systems operate in a consistent and transparent manner while allowing
    flexibility for the individual Systems to serve the needs of their respective
    customers, providing a mechanism for easier collaboration between the Systems.
    This harmonization also provides an opportunity to promote the use of existing,
    and proven, best practices across the IEC CA Systems.
