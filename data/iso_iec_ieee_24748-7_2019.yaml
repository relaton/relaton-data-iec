abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-7:2019 This document establishes the requirements for
    systems engineering activities to be performed on projects of the United States
    (US) Department of Defense (DoD) and other defense agencies across the entire
    system life cycle, including the planning, acquisition, modification, and sustainment
    of defense systems. It provides the foundation for systems engineering within
    the context of ISO/IEC/IEEE 152881 and the acquisition environment of DoD and
    other defense agencies at all levels of system hierarchy. This document provides
    detailed requirements for the application of the life cycle processes, activities,
    and tasks of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 for use on any defense system and includes the
    effective integration of agreement processes, technical processes, technical management
    processes, and essential specialty engineering requirements.
