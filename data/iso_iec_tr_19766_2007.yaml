abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 19766:2007 provides recommendations relating to the design
    of icons to support accessibility by the elderly and people with disabilities.
    These recommendations assist accessible implementation of all icons for users.
    While these recommendations were developed to meet the needs of the elderly and
    people with disabilities, they can also provide greater accessibility to a wider
    range of users in a variety of different contexts.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 19766:2007
    introduces a set of attributes and operations that can be implemented as features
    of graphic icons to make the functionality of these icons accessible to the widest
    possible range of users. Textual attributes are emphasized because they can be
    rendered in various alternate modalities. ISO/IEC 11581-1 provides guidance on
    the graphic aspects of icons. Specific renderings of these attributes (or of icons
    in general) are not dealt with as part of ISO/IEC TR 19766:2007."
