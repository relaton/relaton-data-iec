  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29136:2012 provides requirements and recommendations for the
    accessibility of personal computer hardware, to be used when planning, developing,
    designing and distributing these computers. While it does not cover the behaviour
    of, or requirements for, assistive technologies, it does address connectivity
    of assistive technologies as an integrated component of interactive systems. Some
    requirements or recommendations in ISO/IEC 29136:2012 require software support;
    however, requirements and recommendations that solely focus on software are not
    included in ISO/IEC 29136:2012.</p>"
