abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62630:2010(E) describes exposure evaluation concepts and techniques
    for the overall exposure level in spatial regions and occupants caused by the
    simultaneous exposure to multiple narrowband electromagnetic (EM) sources. Throughout
    this Technical Report, it is assumed that the exposure evaluation occurs under
    static conditions, i.e., the source position and transmit-mode characteristics
    (e.g. emitted power, modulation scheme, etc.) of the device(s) under test do not
    vary significantly over the time required to carry out the evaluation using the
    chosen evaluation technique (e.g., field measurements). IEC/TR 62630:2010 provides
    guidance to IEC TC 106 project teams on how to evaluate the combined exposures
    from multiple electromagnetic (EM) sources in the frequency range 100 kHz to 300
    GHz when specific absorption rate (SAR) and equivalent power density (S) are the
    relevant exposure metrics, as defined by the main international guidelines recommending
    limits on human exposure to EM fields.
