  content: 'Within customer premises, the importance of the cabling infrastructure
    is similar to that of other fundamental building utilities such as heating, lighting
    and mains power. This International Standard provides: a) users with an application
    independent generic cabling system and an open market for cabling components;
    b) users with a flexible cabling scheme such that modifications are both easy
    and economical; c) building professionals (for example, architects) with guidance
    allowing the accom-modation of cabling before specific requirements are known;
    that is, in the initial planning either for construction or refurbishment; d)
    industry and applications standardisation bodies with a cabling system which supports
    current products and provides a basis for future product development. It is a
    consolidated edition, based on edition 1.0 (1995) and including amendments 1:1999
    and 2:1999 as well as corrigendum 1 (December 1996) and corrigendum 2 (June 1997).'
