abstract:
- content: "The ISO/IEC TS 22424 series supports long-term preservation of EPUB publications
    via a dual strategy. This document considers EPUB features from a long-term preservation
    point of view. Some EPUB features are forbidden and some others required, depending
    on how they relate to a long-term preservation. EPUB publications constructed
    according to these guidelines are suitable for preservation.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 22424-2 makes EPUB compliant with Open Archival Information System (OAIS) and
    current practices of OAIS archives."
