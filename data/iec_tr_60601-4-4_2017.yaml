abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60601-4-4:2017(E) is intended to assist writers when drafting alarm
    system-related requirements for particular standards in the IEC 60601 and IEC
    80601 or ISO 80601 series of standards.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is
    to encourage consistent references to alarm system-related requirements when introducing
    those requirements to particular standards. This is accomplished by providing
    suggested model language, with examples, for common alarm system-related requirements.
    Each of the recommendations is based upon text that has been used in existing
    particular standards. The expectation is that this model language will be used
    when alarm system-related requirements are needed in particular standards.<br
    />\r\nThe collateral standard for alarm systems, IEC 60601-1-8, contains the horizontal
    alarm system-related requirements for me equipment and me systems. The recommendations
    in this document are intended to aid the writers of particular standards when
    referencing IEC 60601-1-8:2006 and IEC 60601-1-8:2006/AMD1:2012."
