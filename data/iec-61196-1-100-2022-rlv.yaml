    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61196-1-100:2022
    gives the general requirements and conditions for electrical tests to be performed
    on coaxial communication cables and applies to IEC 61196-1-1xx (all parts), which
    specifies electrical test methods for coaxial communication cables. Further test
    details (for example, temperature, duration) and/or test requirements are given
    in the relevant test procedure and/or the relevant sectional or detail specification.
    A table with electrical test methods of the IEC 61196-1-1xx series is given in
    Annex A. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published
    in 2015. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- update of Annex A, Electrical test
    methods of the IEC 61196-1-1xx series."
