  content: "IEC 60335-2-43:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-43:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-43:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric clothes dryers including clothes dryers intended for drying footwear
    or gloves, and towel rails for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) powered appliances and
    battery-operated appliances. Appliances not intended for normal household use
    but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard deals
    with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br
    />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to:<br />\r\n- spin extractors (IEC 60335-2-4);<br />\r\n- tumble dryers
    (IEC 60335-2-11);<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb)
    conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 11.101, 15.101);<br />\r\nc)
    addition of test probe 19 for accessibility of live parts and moving (8.1.1, 20.2,
    B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nd) addition of accessible surface temperature limits
    (11.3, 11.8).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest
    edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in
    that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established
    on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
