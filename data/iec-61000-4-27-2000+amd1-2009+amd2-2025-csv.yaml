  script: Latn
  content: IEC 61000-4-27:2000+A1:2009+A2:2025 considers immunity tests for electric
    and/or electronic equipment (apparatus and system) in its electromagnetic environment.
    Only conducted phenomena are considered, including immunity tests for equipment
    connected to public and industrial networks. Establishes a reference for evaluating
    the immunity of electrical and electronic equipment when subjected to unbalanced
    power supply voltage. Applies to 50 Hz/60 Hz three-phase powered electrical and/or
    electronic equipment with rated line current up to 16 A per phase. This consolidated
    version consists of the first edition (2000) and its amendment 1 (2009). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.
