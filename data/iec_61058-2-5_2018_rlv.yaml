abstract:
- content: "IEC 61058-2-5:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61058-2-5:2018
    applies to change-over selectors (mechanical or electronic) for appliances actuated
    by hand, by foot or by other human activity, to operate or control electrical
    appliances and other equipment for household or similar purposes with a rated
    voltage not exceeding 480 V and a rated current not exceeding 63 A. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2010 and constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- updated references due
    to new structure of IEC 61058-1;<br />\r\n- changes on conducting the heating
    test due to the corresponding changes in IEC 61058-1."
