abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-4:2004 specifies how tests can be designed to verify
    whether bitstreams and decoders meet requirements specified in ISO/IEC 14496 (parts
    1, 2 and 3) and for ISO/IEC 14496-6:2000. It specifies how tests can be designed
    for bitstream delivery over various delivery technologies in an interoperable
    transparent manner to ISO/IEC 14496 (parts 1, 2 and 3). Encoders are not addressed
    specifically. An encoder may be said to be an ISO/IEC 14496 encoder if it generates
    bitstreams compliant with the syntactic and semantic bitstream requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 14496 (parts 1, 2 and 3).</p><p>Procedures are described for testing
    conformance of bitstreams and decoders to the requirements defined in ISO/IEC
    14496 (parts 1, 2 and 3). Given the set of characteristics claimed, the requirements
    that must be met are fully determined by ISO/IEC 14496 (parts 1, 2 and 3). ISO/IEC
    14496-4:2004 summarizes the requirements, cross references them to characteristics
    and defines how conformance with them can be tested. Guidelines are given on constructing
    tests to verify bitstream and decoder conformance. ISO/IEC 14496-4:2004 gives
    guidelines on how to construct bitstream test suites to check or verify decoder
    conformance. In addition, some test bitstreams implemented according to those
    guidelines are provided as an electronic annex to ISO/IEC 14496-4:2004. These
    test bitstreams are documented in the various sections of ISO/IEC 14496-4:2004.
    The procedures and signaling messages for session and channel establishment are
    defined in ISO/IEC 14496-6:2000.</p><p>Conformance with the signaling messages
    and procedures in ISO/IEC 14496-4:2004 are defined in accordance with the specifications
    in ISO/IEC 14496-6:2000. This specification allows the manufacturer to identify
    the conformance of the signaling message in a static review and provides abstract
    test cases to test the conformance to the procedures in a dynamic review of an
    implementation as defined in ISO/IEC 9646 (all parts), the Conformance Testing
    series of standards.</p>"
