abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    20648:2016 details the requirements for use of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
    protocol in conjunction with data storage technologies. The requirements set out
    in this specification are intended to facilitate secure interoperability of storage
    clients and servers as well as non-storage technologies that may have similar
    interoperability needs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 20648:2016 is relevant to anyone involved
    in owning, operating or using data storage devices. This includes senior managers,
    acquirers of storage product and service, and other non-technical managers or
    users, in addition to managers and administrators who have specific responsibilities
    for information security and/or storage security, storage operation, or who are
    responsible for an organization's overall security program and security policy
    development. It is also relevant to anyone involved in the planning, design and
    implementation of the architectural aspects of storage security."
