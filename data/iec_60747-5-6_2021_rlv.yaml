abstract:
- content: "IEC 60747-5-6:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60747-5-6:2021
    specifies the terminology, the essential ratings and characteristics, the measuring
    methods and the quality evaluations of light emitting diodes (LEDs) for general
    industrial applications such as signals, controllers, sensors, etc.<br />\r\nLEDs
    for lighting applications are out of the scope of this part of IEC 60747.<br />\r\nLEDs
    are classified as follows:<br />\r\n- LED package;<br />\r\n- LED flat illuminator;<br
    />\r\n- LED numeric display and alpha-numeric display;<br />\r\n- LED dot-matrix
    display;<br />\r\n- infrared-emitting diode (IR LED);<br />\r\n- ultraviolet-emitting
    diode (UV LED).<br />\r\nLEDs with a heat spreader or having a terminal geometry
    that performs the function of a heat spreader are within the scope of this part
    of IEC 60747.<br />\r\nAn integration of LEDs and controlgears, integrated LED
    modules, semi-integrated LED modules, integrated LED lamps or semi-integrated
    LED lamps, are out of the scope of this part of IEC 60747. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- ultraviolet-emitting diodes (UV LED) and their related technical contents
    were added;<br />\r\n- power efficiency (Î·PE) as part of electrical and optical
    characteristics were added;<br />\r\n- new measuring methods related to thermal
    resistance were added;<br />\r\n- hydrogen sulphide corrosion test was added to
    quality evaluation;<br />\r\n- some standards were added to the bibliography."
