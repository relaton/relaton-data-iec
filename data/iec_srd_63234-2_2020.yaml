abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63234-1:2020 provides a descriptive framework and template for
    the economic evaluation of the implementation of technology-supported home healthcare,
    wellness or AAL services. IEC SRD 63234-2:2020 provides an example of the use
    of the framework, specifically analysis and economic evaluation of the implementation
    of technology-supported, remote, in-home monitoring of patients (AAL care recipients)
    with chronic diseases.<br />\r\nThis analysis is completed from the point of view
    of the healthcare system/services funder (e.g. the government in a state-sponsored
    healthcare system or possibly a health management/health insurance company in
    a privately funded system).<br />\r\nThis document is structured like IEC SRD
    63234-1:2020, to provide a means of capturing data for the Reference Scenario
    (the current means of providing care, also known as 'usual care', to the target
    population of members of the population with one or more chronic diseases living
    at home), compared against an Alternate Scenario (the deployment of an AAL service
    which provides remote patient monitoring). Standard economic measures have been
    estimated (using an electronic spreadsheet) including Return on Investment (ROI),
    Net Present Value (NPV), and Payback Period of the investment."
