  content: IEC TS 63334:2021 which is a technical specification, defines the conditions
    for testing the protection against dust and water ingress of passive optical protective
    housings and hardened fibre optic connectors (IP5X, IPX4, IPX5, IPX6) performed
    according to IEC 60529. The conditions in this document supplement the test requirements
    specified in IEC 60529. Protective housings and hardened connectors containing
    electrical conductors, electrical connections, passive electrical components,
    active electrical equipment or electronics that transmit signals or provide power
    are not within the scope of this document.
