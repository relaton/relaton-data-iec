  content: IEC 62873-3-3:2016(E) applies to RCDs equipped with screw-type terminals
    of copper - or of alloys containing at least 58 % of copper (if worked cold) or
    at least 50 % of copper (if worked otherwise), or of other metal or suitably coated
    metal, no less resistant to corrosion than copper and having mechanical properties
    no less suitable - for use with untreated aluminium conductors, or with screw-type
    terminals of aluminium material for use with copper or aluminium conductors.
