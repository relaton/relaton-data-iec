  content: IEC TR 62541-1:2016(E) is a Technical Report and presents the concepts
    and overview of the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Reading this document is
    helpful to understand the remaining parts of this multi-part document set. Each
    of the other parts is briefly explained along with a suggested reading order.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC TR 62541-1,
    published in 2010. This edition includes no technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition but includes updates to reflect changes or additions in normative
    parts of IEC 62541.
