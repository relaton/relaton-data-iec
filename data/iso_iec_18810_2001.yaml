abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of
    an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge containing a memory chip to enable physical
    interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the quality of
    the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format - called Advanced
    Intelligent Tape No.2 with Memory In Cartridge (AIT-2 with MIC) - thereby allowing
    data interchange between drives by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.<br
    />\r\nThe System Log are recorded in the MIC.<br />\r\nThis International Standard
    specifies two types of cartridge depending on the thickness of the magnetic tape
    contained in the case.<br />\r\nInformation interchange between systems also requires,
    at a minimum, agreement between the interchange parties upon the interchange code(s)
    and the specifications of the structure and labelling of the information on the
    interchanged cartridge."
