abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of an 8 mm wide magnetic tape cartridge</p><p>containing a memory chip to enable
    physical interchange of such cartridges between drives. It also specifies the
    quality of the</p><p>recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format
    - called Advanced Intelligent Tape No.2 with Memory In</p><p>Cartridge (AIT-2
    with MIC) - thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means of such
    magnetic tape cartridges.</p><p>The System Log are recorded in the MIC.</p><p>This
    International Standard specifies two types of cartridge depending on the thickness
    of the magnetic tape contained in the</p><p>case.</p><p>Information interchange
    between systems also requires, at a minimum, agreement between the interchange
    parties upon the</p><p>interchange code(s) and the specifications of the structure
    and labelling of the information on the interchanged cartridge.</p>"
