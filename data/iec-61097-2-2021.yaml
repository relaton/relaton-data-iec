  content: "IEC 61097-2:2021(E) specifies the minimum performance requirements, technical
    characteristics and type-testing requirements of the emergency position-indicating
    radio beacon used in the Cospas-Sarsat satellite system (EPIRB), as required by
    the International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) as amended, and
    which is associated with IEC 60945. When a requirement in this document is different
    from the requirements in IEC 60945 or other standards, the requirement in this
    document takes precedence.<br />\r\nThis document incorporates the performance
    standards of IMO Resolution MSC.471(101), the International Telecommunication
    Union (ITU) Radio Regulations as well as the technical characteristics for such
    transmitters contained in Recommendation ITU-R M.633, and takes account of the
    general requirements contained in IMO Resolution A.694(17).<br />\r\nThis document
    also includes minimum performance standards for a non-float-free EPIRB without
    float-free release mechanism (see Annex C).<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of December 2021 have been included in this copy."
