  content: "IEC TR 63283-2:2022(EN) has the goal of analyzing the impact of “Smart
    Manufacturing” on the daily operation of an industrial facility. It focusses on
    the perspective of automation and control of the production system, but also on
    the supporting processes of ordering, supply chain management, design, engineering
    and commissioning, operational technology, life cycle management, and resource
    management.<br />\r\nThese recommendations are accomplished on the basis of several
    carefully selected use cases that are familiar to manufacturing industry. Therefore,
    each use case is described, followed by an analysis of the possible influence
    of “Smart Manufacturing” and the assessment of the impact on existing and future
    standardization."
