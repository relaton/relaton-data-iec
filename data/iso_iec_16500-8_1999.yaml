abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 describes the management architecture and
    protocol for managing the DAVIC</p><p>System. The DAVIC system management architecture
    is the TMN-based (Telecommunication Management</p><p>Network) architecture defined
    in ITU-T Recommendation M.3010. This management architecture allows for</p><p>automatic
    administration, configuration, monitoring, billing, and maintenance of the Service
    Provider System, the</p><p>Delivery System, and the Consumer System over the DAVIC
    S5 flows. In accordance with DAVIC 1.3.1a Part 4</p><p>and ISO/IEC 16500-5, the
    content of these flows is based on either the CMIP protocol or the SNMP protocol,</p><p>depending
    on the complexity of the underlying subsystem or the preference of the network
    provider. SNMP</p><p>MIBs (Management Information Base) for managing the STU and
    the Server have been defined in ISO/IEC</p><p>16500-5. Usage related information
    models have also been defined in ISO/IEC 16500-9 using both CMISE and</p><p>SNMP.
    For managing the ATM, SDH/SONET components of the Core Network of the DAVIC Delivery
    System,</p><p>CMISE models defined in ITU-T and ATM Forum are recommended in ISO/IEC
    16500-5 subclause 10.5.3.</p><p>Taking into account that the current DAVIC specification
    for the Access Network is ATM-based 1, this Part of</p><p>ISO/IEC 16500 defines
    CMISE information models for managing the DAVIC Access Network and servicerelated</p><p>data
    in the Delivery System. In the future, if DAVIC specifications allow altenative
    access technologies</p><p>(such as IP-based), additional system management information
    models (such as SNMP MIB) may be needed. The</p><p>management of the coexistence
    of different access network technologies, using different protocols, could be</p><p>achieved
    through interworking tools (i.e., interworking between CMIP and SNMP) as described
    in subclause 6.4.</p><p>Tutorial information on a protocol-independent modeling
    technique is also provided in an informative annex.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC
    16500 is organized as follows:</p><p/><p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 refers to
    system architecture and interface information that are described in ISO/IEC</p><p>16500
    parts?1, -5 and?9 and in DAVIC 1.3.1a Part 4:<em>Delivery system architecture
    and interface</em>.</p>"
