abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-81:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-81:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-81:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric foot warmers and heating mats for household and similar purposes,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied
    appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAdditional requirements can be necessary for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft. In many countries,
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to:<br />\r\n– appliances specifically intended for use under medical supervision;<br
    />\r\n– electric blankets and pads (IEC 60335-2-17);<br />\r\n– electrically heated
    carpets (IEC 60335-2-106);<br />\r\n– electrical heating appliances for breeding
    and rearing animals (IEC 60335-2-71).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2015, Amendment 1:2017 and Amendment 2:2020.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1, 13.2, 16.2, 21.103, 21.104, 21.105, 21.106);<br />\r\nc)
    addition of test probe 19 for accessibility (8.1.1, 8.1.3, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br
    />\r\nd) addition of external surface temperatures (Clause 11);<br />\r\ne) addition
    of the test of 21.107 for control units intended to be placed on a surface;<br
    />\r\nf) alignment of 30.102 with IEC 60335-2-17.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be
    used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
