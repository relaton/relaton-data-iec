    <p>This International Standard specifies the Additional Network Features (ANF) Private User Mobility Incoming Call (PUMI)</p>
    <p>and Private User Mobility Outgoing Call (PUMO), which are applicable to various basic services supported by Private</p>
    <p>Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>ANF-PUMI is an additional network feature that directs incoming calls to a PUM user within a PISN regardless of the PUM</p>
    <p>user's geographical location within the PISN, provided the PUM user's location is known.</p>
    <p>ANF-PUMO is an additional network feature that permits the PISN to process call requests from a PUM user at the home</p>
    <p>location, if required.</p>
    <p>Additional network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387.</p>
    <p>This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-PUMI and ANF-PUMO. The stage 1</p>
    <p>specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies the general feature principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clauses 8 and</p>
    <p>9) identifies the Functional Entities involved in the additional network features and the information flows between them.</p>
