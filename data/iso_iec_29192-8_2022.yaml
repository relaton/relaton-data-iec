abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies one method for authenticated encryption suitable
    for applications requiring lightweight cryptographic mechanisms.</p><p>This method
    processes a data string with the following security objectives:</p><p>a) data
    confidentiality, i.e. protection against unauthorized disclosure of data,</p><p>b)
    data integrity, i.e. protection that enables the recipient of data to verify that
    it has not been modified.</p><p>Optionally, this method can provide data origin
    authentication, i.e. protection that enables the recipient of data to verify the
    identity of the data originator.</p><p>The method specified in this document is
    based on a lightweight stream cipher, and requires the parties of the protected
    data to share a secret key for this algorithm. Key management is outside the scope
    of this document.</p><p>NOTE Key management techniques are defined in the ISO/IEC
    11770 series.</p>"
