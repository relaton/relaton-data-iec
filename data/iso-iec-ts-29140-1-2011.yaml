    <p>ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 provides guidance regarding learning, education and training (LET) situations in which learners are nomadic (travel from place to place, from one location to another or require access to services as they travel to different locations). It can be used as a reference by software developers, implementers, instructional designers, and others to ensure that LET environments reflect the specific needs of these learners. Specifically, ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 provides</p>
    <ul>
    <li>      a definition of nomadicity within LET, </li>
    <li>      a nomadicity reference model indicating the elements required to support learners engaged in activities within LET environments that involve nomadicity, </li>
    <li>      a description of the elements and relationships between the elements, and</li>
    <li>      an introduction to the characteristics of nomadicity that impact on LET activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 also identifies ITLET standards and fields of standardization within ITLET impacted by nomadicity and may be used as a basis for further standardization work and harmonization efforts.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 is intended to support interoperability by providing a nomadicity reference model that can be used by developers, implementers, instructional designers, and others. ISO/IEC TS 29140-2 provides a learner information model specific to mobile learning that can be used as a reference by software developers, implementers, instructional designers, teachers, instructors, and others to ensure that LET environments reflect the specific needs of mobile learners. </p>
    <p>It is essential to differentiate between nomadicity and mobile learning approaches because the former is considered to be independent of the ICT involved. A concise view and understanding is needed of how nomadic learners' needs and requirements can be met using standardization efforts. The focus of ISO/IEC TS 29140-1:2011 is to ensure that not only is the concept of "nomadicity" understood, but that the user needs and requirements have been addressed. </p>
