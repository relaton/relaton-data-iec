abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-45:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-45:2024
    establishes uniform requirements for measuring the mode field diameter (MFD) of
    single-mode optical fibre, thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables
    for commercial purposes. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) modification of the minimum distance between the fibre end
    and the detector for the direct far field scan (Annex A).<br />\r\nb) generalization
    of the requirement for the minimum dynamic range for all fibre types (Annex A)."
