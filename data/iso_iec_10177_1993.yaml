abstract:
- content: Specifies the method by which a network-layer interworking unit (IWU) uses
    the X.25 packet layer protocol to support the OSI connection-mode network service.
    The specification is expressed in terms of a mapping between the network internal
    layer service defined in ISO/IEC 10028 and the virtual call and permanent virtual
    circuit services of the X.25 packet layer protocol. Provides the PICS (Protocol
    Implementation Conformance Statement) proforma in compliance with the relevant
    requirements, and in accordance with the relevant guidance, given in ISO/IEC 9646-2.
