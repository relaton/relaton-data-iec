abstract:
- content: The general objectives of ISO/IEC 18028 are to extend the IT security management
    guidelines provided in ISO/IEC TR 13335 by detailing the specific operations and
    mechanisms needed to implement network security safeguards and controls in a wider
    range of network environments, providing a bridge between general IT security
    management issues and network security technical implementations.ISO/IEC 18028-4:2005
    provides guidance for securely using remote access - a method to remotely connect
    a computer either to another computer or to a network using public networks -
    and its implication for IT security. In this it introduces the different types
    of remote access including the protocols in use, discusses the authentication
    issues related to remote access and provides support when setting up remote access
    securely. It is intended to help network administrators and technicians who plan
    to make use of this kind of connection or who already have it in use and need
    advice on how to set it up securely and operate it securely.
