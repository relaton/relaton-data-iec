abstract:
- content: IEC 61639-99:2016(E) is a component of the Software Interface for Maintenance
    Information Collection and Analysis (SIMICA). The SIMICA family of standards provides
    an implementation-independent software interfaces to information systems containing
    data pertinent to the diagnosis and maintenance of complex systems consisting
    of hardware, software, or any combination thereof. This standard defines EXPRESS
    information models and XML schemas that together define the common information
    elements supporting these interfaces. This standard is published as a double logo
    IEC-IEEE standard.
