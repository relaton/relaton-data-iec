abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63149:2018(E) is aimed at presenting mathematical models for calculation
    of the distance between arrays, to farthest avoid shading and reasonably reduce
    the land usage of PV farms. This document provides land usage calculations of
    PV farms for various array types.
