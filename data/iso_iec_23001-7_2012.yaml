abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23001-7:2012 specifies a common encryption format for use in
    any file format based on ISO/IEC 14496-12, the ISO base media file format.</p><p>The
    'cenc' Common Encryption Scheme specifies standard encryption and key mapping
    methods that can be utilized by one or more digital rights and key management
    systems (DRM systems) to enable decryption of the same file using different DRM
    systems. The scheme operates by defining a common format for the encryption related
    metadata necessary to decrypt the protected streams, yet leaves the details of
    rights mappings, key acquisition and storage, DRM compliance rules, etc. up to
    the DRM system or systems supporting the 'cenc' scheme.</p>"
