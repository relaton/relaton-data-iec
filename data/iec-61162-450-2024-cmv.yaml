  content: "IEC 61162-450:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61162-450:2024 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61162-450:2018
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 80 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61162-450:2024 specifies interface requirements and methods
    of test for high speed communication between shipboard navigation and radiocommunication
    equipment as well as between such systems and other ship systems that need to
    communicate with navigation and radio-communication equipment. This document is
    based on the application of an appropriate suite of existing international standards
    to provide a framework for implementing data transfer between devices on a shipboard
    Ethernet network."
