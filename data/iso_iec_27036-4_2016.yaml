abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 provides cloud service customers and cloud service
    providers with guidance on<p>a) gaining visibility into the information security
    risks associated with the use of cloud services and managing those risks effectively,
    and</p><p>b) responding to risks specific to the acquisition or provision of cloud
    services that can have an information security impact on organizations using these
    services.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 does not include business continuity management/resiliency
    issues involved with the cloud service. ISO/IEC 27031 addresses business continuity.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    27036-4:2016 does not provide guidance on how a cloud service provider should
    implement, manage and operate information security. Guidance on those can be found
    in ISO/IEC 27002 and ISO/IEC 27017.</p><p>The scope of ISO/IEC 27036-4:2016 is
    to define guidelines supporting the implementation of information security management
    for the use of cloud services.</p>
