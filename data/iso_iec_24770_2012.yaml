abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24770:2012 defines the test methods for determining the performance
    characteristics of 2,4 GHz real-time locating system (RTLS) equipment including
    tags, readers, and exciters which are applicable to the selection of equipment
    that conforms to ISO/IEC 24730-2 for specific applications. ISO/IEC 24770:2012
    does not apply to the testing in relation to regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The
    RTLS equipment performance parameters included in ISO/IEC 24770:2012 include the
    mandatory direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 2,4 GHz radio frequency beacon
    link between tags and readers. It includes the optional on-off keyed/frequency
    shift keyed (OOK/FSK) short range radio frequency link between tags and programmers.
    It also includes the optional magnetic air-interface between exciters and tags
    and between programmers and tags.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests
    in ISO/IEC 24770:2012 apply exclusively to RTLS equipment defined in ISO/IEC 24730-2.</p>"
