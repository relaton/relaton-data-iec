    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005 specifies:</p>
    <ul><li>contents of command-response pairs exchanged at the interface,</li><li>means of retrieval of data elements and data objects in the card,</li><li>structures and contents of historical bytes to describe operating characteristics of the card,</li><li>structures for applications and data in the card, as seen at the interface when processing commands,</li><li>access methods to files and data in the card,</li><li>a security architecture defining access rights to files and data in the card,</li><li>means and mechanisms for identifying and addressing applications in the card,</li><li>methods for secure messaging,</li><li>access methods to the algorithms processed by the card. It does not describe these algorithms.</li></ul>
    <p>It does not cover the internal implementation within the card or the outside world.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-4:2005 is independent from the physical interface technology. It applies to cards accessed by one or more of the following methods: contacts, close coupling, and radio frequency.</p>
