    IEC TR 62001-4:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, provides guidance on the basic data of AC side filters for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and their components such as ratings, power losses, design issues and special applications, protection, seismic requirements, equipment design and test parameters. This document covers AC side filtering for the frequency range of interest in terms of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances. It excludes filters designed to be effective in the power line carrier (PLC) and radio interference spectra. It concerns the "conventional" AC filter technology and line-commutated HVDC converters. This first edition of IEC TR 62001-4, together with IEC TR 62001-1, IEC TR 62001-2 and IEC TR 62001-3, cancels and replaces IEC TR 62001 published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to IEC TR 62001:<br />
    a) Clauses 10 to 16, 18, Annexes F and G have been expanded and supplemented.
