  content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-481:2019 defines a device model that is applicable
    to all SCSI devices. Other command standards expand on the general SCSI device
    model in ways appropriate to specific types of SCSI devices.</br>\r\nISO&#x2F;IEC
    14776 (all parts) specifies the interfaces, functions, and operations necessary
    to ensure interoperability between conforming SCSI implementations. This document
    is a functional description. Conforming implementations employ any design technique
    that does not violate interoperability.</br>\r\nThis document defines security
    features for use by all SCSI devices. This document defines the security model
    that is basic to every device model and the parameter data that applies to any
    device model. For additional information on the security goals and threat model
    discussed in this document see Annex A."
