abstract:
- content: "IEC 60146-1-1:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60146-1-1:2024 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60146-1-1:2009
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 22 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60146-1-1:2024 specifies the requirements for the performance
    of all semiconductor power converters and semiconductor power switches using controllable
    and/or non-controllable electronic valve devices. It is primarily intended to
    specify the basic requirements for converters in general and the requirements
    applicable to line commutated converters for conversion of AC power to DC power
    or vice versa. Parts of this document are also applicable to other types of electronic
    power converter provided that they do not have their own product standards.<br
    />\r\nThis fifth edition introduces four main changes:<br />\r\na) re-edition
    of the whole standard according to the current directives;<br />\r\nb) deletion
    of safety-related descriptions considering coordination with IEC 62477 series;<br
    />\r\nc) changes of calculation methods of inductive voltage regulation;<br />\r\nd)
    changes considering coordination with IEC 61378 series."
