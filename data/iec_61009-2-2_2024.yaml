abstract:
- content: "IEC 61009-2-2:2024 applies to residual current operated circuit-breakers,
    with integral overcurrent protection, for household and similar uses (hereafter
    referred to as RCBOs), classified according to IEC 61009-1:2024, 4.1.2, 4.1.3,
    4.1.4, 4.1.5 and 4.1.6. RCBOs according to this document are intended for voltages
    not exceeding 440 V AC with frequencies of 50 Hz, 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz and currents
    not exceeding 125 A and rated shortâ€‘circuit capacities not exceeding 25 000 A
    for operation at 50 Hz or 60 Hz.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 1991. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) harmonization of all clauses between the
    IEC 61008, IEC 61009 and IEC 60755 series using blocks and modules approach;<br
    />\r\nb) harmonization of all tables and figures between the IEC 61008, IEC 61009
    and IEC 60755 series;<br />\r\nc) terms and definitions are now referred to IEC
    62873-2;<br />\r\nd) modification of 4.1 for classification according to supply
    conditions;<br />\r\ne) modification of Clause 6 for markings of RCBOs with a
    functional earth (FE);<br />\r\nf) specific tests for operating characteristics
    of RCBO according to classifications 4.1.2, 4.1.3, 4.1.4, 4.1.5 and 4.1.6;<br
    />\r\ng) specific test conditions for dielectric properties (9.7), temperature-rise
    (9.8), electrical and mechanical endurance (9.10), short-circuit tests (9.11),
    verification of trip-free (9.15), behaviour in the event of loss of the supply
    voltage (9.17), surge current tests (9.19), reliability (9.20), ageing (9.21)
    and temporary overvoltage TOV (9.24);<br />\r\nh) additional tests for RCBOs with
    a terminal connected to the FE: Connecting capacity of FE terminal (9.200); Limitation
    of standing current in the FE (9.201)."
