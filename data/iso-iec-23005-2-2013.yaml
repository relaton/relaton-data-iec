    <p>ISO/IEC 23005-2:2013 specifies syntax and semantics of the tools required to provide interoperability in controlling devices in real as well as virtual worlds. The adaptation engine (RV or VR engine), which is not within the scope of standardization, takes six inputs [sensory effects (SE), user's sensory effect preferences (USEP), sensory devices capabilities (SDC), sensor capability (SC), sensor adaptation preferences (SAP), and sensed information (SI)] and outputs sensory devices commands (SDCmd) and/or sensed information (SI) to control the devices in real world or virtual world objects. </p>
    <p>It is applicable to the interfaces between the adaptation engine and the capability descriptions of actuators/sensors in the real world; the user's sensory preference information, which characterize devices and users; and the sensor adaptation preferences information, which characterize sensors and users, so that appropriate information to control devices (actuators and sensors) can be generated. User's sensory preferences, sensory device capabilities, sensor adaptation preferences, and sensor capabilities are within the scope of ISO/IEC 23005-2:2013.</p>
