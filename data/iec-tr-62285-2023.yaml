  content: "IEC TR 62285:2023 which is a Technical Report, provides guidelines for
    uniform measurements of the nonlinear coefficient of class B single-mode fibres
    (see IEC 60793-2-50) in the 1 550 nm region. Measurements of the nonlinear coefficient
    are used to characterise specific single-mode fibre designs for the purpose of
    system design relative to power levels and distortion or noise effects derived
    from the nonlinear optical behaviour. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2005. It constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following signification technical changes with respect to
    the previous revision:<br />\r\na) change fibre type of pigtail to B-652.D fibre
    or fibre of same type with the fibre under test;<br />\r\nb) modifications on
    Figure A.1 and Formulas (A.3), (A.4);<br />\r\nc) add example values and recommended
    method A test conditions for B-G.654.E fibre, update Table C.1."
