abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-76:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-76:2018
    deals with the safety of electric fence energizers, the rated voltage of which
    is not more than 250 V and by means of which fence wires in agricultural, domestic
    or feral animal control fences and security fences may be electrified or monitored.
    Examples of electric fence energizers coming within the scope of this standard
    are:<br />\r\n– mains-operated energizers;<br />\r\n– battery-operated electric
    fence energizers suitable for connection to the mains;<br />\r\n– electric fence
    energizers operated by non-rechargeable batteries either incorporated or separate.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– electromagnetically coupled
    animal trainer collars;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– separate battery chargers (IEC 60335-2-29);<br
    />\r\n– electric fishing machines (IEC 60335-2-86);<br />\r\n– electric animal-stunning
    equipment (IEC 60335-2-87);<br />\r\n– appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601).<br
    />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis of the fifth edition
    (2010) of that standard. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2002, Amendment 1:2006 and Amendment 2:2013. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n– the text has been aligned
    with Edition 5.2 of Part 1;<br />\r\n– additional requirements for security fence
    energizers have been introduced (Clauses 3, 7, 19, 22, Figures and Annex BB);<br
    />\r\n– specific requirements for battery operated energizers have been moved
    to Annex S.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of November 2018 have been
    included in this copy."
