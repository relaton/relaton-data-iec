abstract:
- content: IEC 63092-1:2020 specifies BIPV (building-integrated photovoltaic) module
    requirements and applies to photovoltaic modules used as building products. It
    focuses on the properties of these photovoltaic modules relevant to basic building
    requirements and the applicable electro-technical requirements. This document
    addresses requirements on the BIPV modules in the specific ways they are intended
    to be mounted but not the mounting structure itself, which is within the scope
    of IEC 63092-2. This document is based on EN 50583-1.
