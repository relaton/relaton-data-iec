  content: "IEC TS 60255-216-1:2025 covers protection functions with digital inputs
    and outputs complying with IEC 61850 series and IEC 61869 series, in particular
    regarding<br />\r\n- subscription to sampled values (SV) streams representing
    energising inputs instead of analog inputs (see Figure 1);<br />\r\n- subscription
    to GOOSE (e.g. circuit breaker position, circuit breaker failure);<br />\r\n-
    publication of GOOSE messages (e.g. trip signals);<br />\r\n- subscription to
    time synchronisation messages.<br />\r\nOn this basis, this document formulates
    requirements for protection functions with digital inputs and outputs and for
    the IED hosting them. The document also covers tests related to the functional
    interoperability and functional requirements of these protection functions, in
    addition to the general conformance tests required by IEC 61850-10:2012 and test
    related requirements in IEC TR 61850‑10-3:2022."
