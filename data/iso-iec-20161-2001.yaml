    <p>This International Standard specifies the combination of base standards, together with the selection of appropriate options and</p>
    <p>parameter values, necessary to specify how QSIG / PSS1 can be used to provide digital signalling capabilities at interfaces at</p>
    <p>the C reference point between a Private Integrated services Network eXchange (PINX) and an Interconnecting Network (ICN)</p>
    <p>to permit interoperability between equipment from different vendors and different public or private service providers.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1 - PINX in the sense of this International Standard is used in the meaning of a PINX directly attached to the ICN.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable to attached PINXs and Interconnecting Networks (ICN).</p>
    <p>This International Standard identifies the necessary or optional employment of particular functions, procedures and services</p>
    <p>when provided:</p>
    <p>- physical and electrical characteristics (physical layer) of the interfaces to the transmission systems to be employed;</p>
    <p>- data link layer procedures;</p>
    <p>- network layer procedures; and</p>
    <p>- supplementary services and additional network features to meet specific corporate network user requirements.</p>
    <p>This International Standard states requirements upon attached PINXs and Interconnecting Network (ICN) implementations in</p>
    <p>order to achieve interoperability between equipment in PISNs serving as Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs).</p>
    <p>NOTE 2 - Implementation of this International Standard does not preclude a manufacturer from offering other means of interconnection. It</p>
    <p>also does not preclude a VPN service provider to offer basic call communications between a PINX and other networks like PSTN or ISDN.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 14475 specifies various access arrangements between a PINX and a public network where reference points C and</p>
    <p>T reside either at a single or at separate interfaces. The scope of this International Standard is limited to cover the C reference</p>
    <p>point aspects at a separate interface.</p>
    <p>The current version of this International Standard does not intend to specify any gateway or end PINX requirements for the ICN</p>
    <p>side of the interface. Therefore it typically uses the term "virtual transit PINX" instead of Interconnecting Network (ICN).</p>
