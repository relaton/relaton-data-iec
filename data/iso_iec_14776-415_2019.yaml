abstract:
- content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 14776-415:2019 defines a reference model that specifies common
    behaviors for SCSI devices, and an abstract structure that is generic to all SCSI
    I&#x2F;O system implementations.The set of Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)
    specifies the interfaces, functions, and operations necessary to ensure interoperability
    between conforming SCSI implementations. This document is a functional description.
    Conforming implementations employ any design technique that does not violate interoperability.\r\nThe
    following concepts from previous versions of the SAM standard are made obsolete
    by this version:\r\na) support for the SPI-5 SCSI transport protocol;\r\nb) Contingent
    Allegiance;\r\nc) the TARGET RESET task management function;\r\nd) basic task
    management model;\r\ne) untagged tasks; and\r\nf) linked command function."
