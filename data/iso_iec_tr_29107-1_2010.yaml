abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29107-1:2010 specifies the concept for a taxonomy of standards and other related
    specifications applicable to intelligent homes. It is intended for the classification
    of specifications from ISO, IEC, ISO/IEC JTC 1, ITU and from organizations with
    liaison status with any of these. It is intended to the various standardisation
    bodies that are contributing to the intelligent home. With the help of the concept
    described in this report they should be able to classify their specifications.
    This will benefit the standardisation bodies to determine if there are overlapping
    specifications or areas for which specifications are missing."
