abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15149-2:2015 Standard establishes a system for an in-band network,
    from which both wireless power transfer and data transmission are carried out
    simultaneously at the same frequency band. It provides technical solution for
    a remote and consistent power supply, along with a stable network.</p><p>For the
    purpose of this International Standard, the system is designed based on the principles
    described in ISO/IEC 15149 (Magnetic Field Area Network). In this way, it is expected
    to achieve superiority in control of devices, while managing wireless power transfer
    to multiple devices in request. The focus is on the physical and media access
    control layer protocol; it will not discuss matters on the upper layer protocols.
    As together, the PHY and MAC layers have to be able to carry out the following
    tasks: data transmission, signal control, wireless power transfer.</p><p>This
    International Standard is applicable in various situations and environments, but
    is expected to perform excellently in the following certain use cases:</p><p>-
    mobile phones: provide ubiquitous charging environments for portable devices;</p><p>-
    home appliances: allow unrestrained placement of appliances with the elimination
    of wire cables and plugs for power supply.</p><p>The media access control layer
    protocol is designed for the following scope:</p><p>- variable superframe structure
    for wireless power transfer to multiple devices;</p><p>- simple and effective
    network topology for efficient wireless power transfer;</p><p>- dynamic address
    assignment for efficient timesharing among multiple devices.</p><p>The physical
    layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p><p>- one frequency band
    for both wireless power transfer and magnetic field communication;</p><p>- simple
    and robust modulation for low-cost implementation and minimized margin of error;</p><p>-
    variable coding and bandwidth for dynamic charging environment.</p>"
