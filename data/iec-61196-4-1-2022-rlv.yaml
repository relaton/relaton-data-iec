    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61196-4-1:2022
    applies to radiating coaxial communication cables. These cables are intended for
    use in wireless communication system in long, narrow, semi-closed and indoor environment,
    such as tunnels, railways, highways, subways, elevators and other installations.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na.
    rewrote \"1 Scope\" to be consistent with other blank detail specifications of
    coaxial cables;<br />\r\nb. added detail construction requirements of inner and
    outer conductor in \"[7] Cable construction\";<br />\r\nc. added \"Storage temperature
    range\", \"Installation temperature range\" and \"Stop frequency band\" in \"[8]
    Engineering information (reference only)\";<br />\r\nd. added \"8.2.11 Link loss\",
    \"8.4.9 Adhesion of dielectric\", \"8.4.10 Shrinkage for insulations\", \"8.4.11
    Maximum pulling force of cable\";<br />\r\ne. added different detail requirements
    or typical values in 8.2.4, 8.2.6 to 8.2.8, 8.3.1 to 8.3.4， 8.4.1, 8.4.3 to 8.4.8;<br
    />\r\nf. deleted \"7.4.4 Ovality of outer conductor\".\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">
