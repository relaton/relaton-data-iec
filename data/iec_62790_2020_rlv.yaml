abstract:
- content: "IEC 62790:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62790:2020
    describes safety requirements, constructional requirements and tests for junction
    boxes up to 1 500 V DC for use on photovoltaic modules in accordance with class
    II of IEC 61140:2016.<br />\r\nThis document applies also to enclosures mounted
    on PV-modules containing electronic circuits for converting, controlling, monitoring
    or similar operations. Additional requirements concerning the relevant operations
    are applied under consideration of the environmental conditions of the PV-modules.
    This document does not apply to the electronic circuits of these devices, for
    which other IEC standards apply. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2014. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Modifications
    in normative references and terms and definitions;<br />\r\n- Improvement of declaration
    of categories for junction boxes in 4.1;<br />\r\n- Clarification for ambient
    temperature in 4.1;<br />\r\n- Addition of requirement to provide information
    concerning RTE/RTI or TI in 4.2;<br />\r\n- Reference to IEC 62930 instead of
    EN 50618 in 4.6;<br />\r\n- Addition of \"Functional insulation\" in Table 1;<br
    />\r\n- Addition of \"Distance through cemented joints\" in Table 3;<br />\r\n-
    Correction of procedure of process to categorize material groups (deletion of
    PTI) in 4.15.2.3;<br />\r\n- Requirement for approval of RTE/RTI or TI for insulation
    parts in 4.16.1 and 4.16.2;<br />\r\n- Change of requirements concerning electrochemical
    potential in 4.17.2;<br />\r\n- Clarification for IP-test in 5.3.4.2;<br />\r\n-
    Addition of test voltage for cemented joints in 5.3.6 and 5.3.16;<br />\r\n- Addition
    of detailled description on how to prepare the test sample for the thermal cycle
    test in 5.3.9.1;<br />\r\n- New test procedure for bypass diode thermal test (5.3.18)
    in accordance with MQT 18.1 of IEC 61215-2:2016;<br />\r\n- New test procedure
    for reverse overload current test in 5.3.23;<br />\r\n- New Figure 1 for thermal
    cycle test."
