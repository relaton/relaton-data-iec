abstract:
- content: "<p>People with disabilities (e.g. visual, hearing, physical) can experience
    difficulties in accessing computers and other information/communication technology
    (ICT) devices. Accessible user interfaces, as defined in ISO/IEC 24786:2009, can
    help them to operate computers if they are able to adjust accessibility settings
    prior to use. If this is not possible, some people will not be able to access
    these devices without help from another party.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24786:2009 specifies
    requirements and recommendations for making accessibility settings accessible.
    This will make the information technologies more accessible by ensuring that people
    with disabilities can adjust accessibility settings by themselves.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    24786:2009 provides guidance on specific accessibility settings. It specifies
    how to access and operate the accessibility setting mode, and how to directly
    activate specific accessibility functions.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24786:2009 applies to
    all operating system user interfaces on computers, but can also be applied to
    other types of ICT, where appropriate. It does not apply to the user interface
    before the operating system is loaded and active.</p>"
