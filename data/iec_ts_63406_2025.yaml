abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63406:2025 addresses the generic root-mean-square (RMS) simulation
    models of inverter-based generators for power system dynamic analysis. The scope
    of the document covers the grid-connected IBGs for photovoltaic power generation
    systems, wind turbine generation systems with full-scale converters (i.e. Type-4
    wind turbine systems), wave energy generation systems, fuel cell energy generation
    systems, battery energy storage systems, supercapacitor energy storage systems,
    flywheel energy storage systems, AC- or DC-coupled hybrid energy generation or
    storage systems, etc.<br />\r\nThis document is to specify generic dynamic models
    for various types of IBGs, which can be applied in power system stability studies.<br
