abstract:
- content: It is one of a series produced to facilitate the interconnection of automation
    system components. It is related to other standards in the set as defined by the
    "three-layer" fieldbus reference model described in IEC/TR 61158 1. This sub-part
    contains material specific to Type 3 fieldbus. It includes the following significant
    changes with respect to the previous edition deletion of the former Type 6 fieldbus,
    and the placeholder for a Type 5 fieldbus data-link layer, for lack of market
    relevance; addition of new types of fieldbuses; division of this part into multiple
    parts numbered.
