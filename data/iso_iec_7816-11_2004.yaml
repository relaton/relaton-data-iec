- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-11:2004 specifies the usage of interindustry commands
    and data objects related to personal verification through biometric methods in
    integrated circuit cards. The interindustry commands used are defined in ISO/IEC
    7816-4. The data objects are partially defined in this International Standard,
    partially imported from ISO/IEC 19785-1.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7816-11 also presents examples
    for enrollment and verification and addresses security issues.</p>"
