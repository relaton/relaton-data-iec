abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63074:2023 identifies the relevant aspects of the IEC 62443 series
    related to security threats and vulnerabilities that are considered for the design
    and implementation of safety-related control systems (SCS) which can lead to the
    loss of the ability to maintain safe operation of a machine.<br />\r\nTypical
    security aspects related to the machine with potential relation to SCS are:<br
    />\r\n– vulnerabilities of the SCS either directly or indirectly through the other
    parts of the machine which can be exploited by security threats that can result
    in security attacks (security breach);<br />\r\n– influence on the safety characteristics
    and ability of the SCS to properly perform its function(s);<br />\r\n– typical
    use case definition and application of a corresponding threat model.<br />\r\nNon-safety-related
    aspects of security threats and vulnerabilities are not considered in this document.<br
    />\r\nThe focus of this document is on intentional malicious actions. However,
    intentional hardware manipulation (e.g. wiring, exchange of components) or foreseeable
    misuse by physical manipulation of SCS (e.g. physical bypass) is not considered
    in this document.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover security requirements
    for information technology (IT) products and for the design of devices used in
    the SCS (e.g., product specific standards can be available, such as IEC TS 63208)."
