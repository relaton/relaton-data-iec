abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63212:2020 provides a feasibility assessment to determine if harmonization
    of environmental performance criteria is possible and would benefit the electrotechnical
    industry.<br />\r\nThis document is intended as a feasibility study report rather
    than a standard. It reports the possibility/opportunity to harmonize environmental
    performance criteria and, with it, the feasibility for future development of an
    international standard on environmental performance criteria. The learnings and
    recommendations of this document are based on the review of a number of prominent
    ecolabel standards available worldwide as well as outreach discussions with internal
    and external stakeholders.<br />\r\nTo enable users of this document to visualize
    and better evaluate what such a future standard could look like, a concept for
    an international standard on harmonized criteria for environmental performance
    assessment of electrotechnical products has been proposed in Clause 8. It is not
    intended as a final proposal but rather a vision of how such a standard would
    be structured and how it could be implemented to meet the specific requirements
    that were identified in the study.<br />\r\nOnce again, it is important to emphasize
    that the potential IEC standard on environmental performance criteria is not intended
    as an ecolabel standard, but it is intended to be a means for harmonization of
    the criteria (including the verification requirements of them) that are needed
    for creating such an ecolabel standard."
