abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61400-4-1:2026 specifies a method to calculate the design reliability
    of wind turbines gearboxes covered by IEC 61400‑4, based upon failure modes where
    standardized calculation methods are publicly available.<br />\r\nFor the calculable
    failure mechanisms, it is possible to compare the reliability between different
    gearbox designs within the limitations of the theoretical models. The use of field-based
    statistical parameters can improve the accuracy of the calculated reliability.<br
    />\r\nThe calculated design reliability can provide information for the lifecycle
    management strategy. However, this document does not provide trade-off decisions
    between higher design reliability and maintenance strategies (e.g. preventive
    or predictive maintenance). This document does not consider repairable system
    analysis.<br />\r\nDue to the lack of accepted theoretical models for some failure
    modes, the model can currently not predict the apparent failure probability in
    the field.<br />\r\nNeither this document nor IEC 61400-4 specify a minimum value
    of design reliability."
