  content: "IEC 60079-15:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60079-15:2017
    specifies requirements for the construction, testing and marking for Group II
    electrical equipment with type of protection “n” which includes; sealed devices
    “nC”, hermetically sealed devices “nC”, non-incendive components “nC” and restricted
    breathing enclosures “nR” intended for use in explosive gas atmospheres. This
    part of IEC 60079 applies to electrical equipment where the rated input voltage
    does not exceed 15 kV r.m.s. AC or DC including where the internal working voltages
    of the Ex product exceeds 15 kV, for example starters for HID luminaires. This
    part of IEC 60079 supplements and modifies the general requirements of IEC 60079-0,
    except as indicated in Table 1 (Clause 1). Where a requirement of this part of
    IEC 60079 conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the requirement of this
    part of IEC 60079 takes precedence. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the
    fourth edition, published in 2010, and constitutes a technical revision. Refer
    to the Forward of the document for a complete listing of the technical changes
    between edition 5.0 and the previous edition of the document.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords:
    Group II electrical equipment with type of protection “n”"
