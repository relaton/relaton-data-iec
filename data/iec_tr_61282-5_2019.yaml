abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61282-5:2019 which is a Technical Report, describes various techniques
    for accommodation and compensation of chromatic dispersion in fibre optic communication
    systems. These techniques include dispersion compensation with passive optical
    components, advanced dispersion management, and electronic accommodation of dispersion
    in the transmitters and receivers. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition, published in 2002, and constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) extends the application space for dispersion compensation
    and accommodation to communication systems that employ non-zero dispersion-shifted
    fibres;<br />\r\nb) adds a discussion on the suitability of fibre types for long-haul
    transmission of wavelength-multiplexed signals;<br />\r\nc) updates the dispersion
    coefficient limits for dispersion-unshifted fibres;<br />\r\nd) adds information
    on the dispersion coefficients of dispersion-shifted fibres;<br />\r\ne) updates
    the naming of the fibre types to the revised naming conventions defined in IEC
    60793-2-50:2018;<br />\r\nf) updates Table 2 to include the dispersion tolerance
    of phase-shift-keyed modulation formats used for the transmission of 40 Gbit/s
    and 100 Gbit/s signals;<br />\r\ng) adds information on dispersion management
    in terrestrial and submarine communication systems;<br />\r\nh) extends the description
    of passive dispersion compensators based on fibre Bragg gratings and etalons;<br
    />\r\ni) adds information on electronic dispersion accommodation in coherent communication
    systems (including transmitters and receivers);<br />\r\nj) updates the description
    of optical accommodation techniques to include soliton transmission and mid-span
    spectral inversion;<br />\r\nk) extends the list of system parameters for passive
    dispersion compensators to include wavelength-dependent loss, phase ripple, and
    latency;<br />\r\nl) updates the description of dispersion compensator applications
    in long-haul communication systems.<br />\r\nKeywords: chromatic dispersion"
