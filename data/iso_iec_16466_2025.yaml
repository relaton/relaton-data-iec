abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies methods and metrics for
    assessing the accuracy and precision of 3D scanned data for use in 3D printing,
    throughout the full 3D printing lifecycle.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    focuses mainly on 3D scanned data from computed tomography. Computed tomography
    can acquire information concerning the internal structures, regional density,
    orientation and/or alignment of scanning objects, as well as their shape and appearance.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document is applicable to the assessment of image-based
    modelling, segmentation, and 3D models.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    is not intended to assess the 3D printed product itself.</p>
