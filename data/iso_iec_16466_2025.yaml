- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    specifies methods and metrics for assessing the accuracy and precision of 3D scanned
    data for use in 3D printing, throughout the full 3D printing lifecycle.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">This document focuses mainly on 3D scanned data from computed
    tomography. Computed tomography can acquire information concerning the internal
    structures, regional density, orientation and/or alignment of scanning objects,
    as well as their shape and appearance.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document
    is applicable to the assessment of image-based modelling, segmentation, and 3D
    models.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document is not intended to assess the
    3D printed product itself.</p>
