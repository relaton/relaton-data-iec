abstract:
- content: "IEC 62153-4-15:2021+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the procedures for measuring
    with triaxial cell the transfer impedance, screening attenuation or the coupling
    attenuation of connectors, cable assemblies and components, for example accessories
    for analogue and digital transmission systems, and equipment for communication
    networks and cabling. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2015.This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) measurement of coupling attenuation
    of balanced connectors, assemblies and components with balun and balunless added;<br
    />\r\nb) application of a test adapter was added;<br />\r\nc) application of a
    moveable shorting plane;<br />\r\nd) application of the triaxial \"absorber\"
    cell;<br />\r\ne) correction of test results in the case that the receiver input
    impedance R is higher than the characteristic impedance of the outer circuit Z2."
