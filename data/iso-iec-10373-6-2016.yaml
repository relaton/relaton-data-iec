    <p>ISO/IEC 10373-6:2016 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards according to the definition given in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross‑referenced to one or more base standards, which can be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification card applications.</p>
    <p>NOTE 1    Criteria for acceptability do not form part of ISO/IEC 10373-6 :2016, but will be found in the International Standards mentioned above.</p>
    <p>NOTE 2    Test methods defined in ISO/IEC 10373-6 :2016 are intended to be performed separately. A given proximity card or object, or proximity coupling device, is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10373-6:2016 defines test methods which are specific to proximity cards and objects, and proximity coupling devices and proximity extended devices, defined in ISO/IEC 14443‑1, ISO/IEC 14443‑2, ISO/IEC 14443‑3, and ISO/IEC 14443‑4.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10373‑1 defines test methods which are common to one or more integrated circuit card technologies and other parts deal with other technology‑specific tests.</p>
