    <p>This Recommendation | Technical Report provides:</p>
    <p>a) the description of a means to permit a protocol to be identified;</p>
    <p>b) a record of the structure and allowable ranges of protocol identifier(s) which can be assigned by ITU-T,</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC and other authorities;</p>
    <p>c) a record of the values of protocol identifiers used by OSI Network layer protocols and non-OSI protocols</p>
    <p>occupying a similar position: in particular, protocols with protocol control information commencing in</p>
    <p>octet 1 of the protocol data unit (header-oriented protocols), and protocols with protocol control</p>
    <p>information commencing in the final octet of the protocol data unit (trailer-oriented protocols), are</p>
    <p>covered; and</p>
    <p>d) a record of the values that are in use as protocol control information in non-Network layer protocols</p>
    <p>where they impact on Network layer protocol identification.</p>
    <p>The application of this Recommendation | Technical Report is:</p>
    <p>a) in the identification of internationally standardized Network layer protocols operating directly above the</p>
    <p>Data Link service;</p>
    <p>b) in the identification of protocols used in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer</p>
    <p>protocols that operate directly above the Data Link service; and</p>
    <p>c) to distinguish between Internationally standardized Network layer protocols, and other internationally</p>
    <p>standardized protocols used in conjunction with internationally standardized Network layer protocols.</p>
    <p>This Recommendation | Technical Report is for use by ITU-T Study Groups, ISO/IEC Technical Committees and other</p>
    <p>authorities in applying the principles contained in clause 4, and in selecting an unused value or values from the range of</p>
    <p>values permitted in clauses 5 or 6, as appropriate. When a new value is selected, that value and its usage should be</p>
    <p>brought to the attention of ITU-T Study Group 7 or ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC6 so that this Recommendation | Technical Report</p>
    <p>can be amended.</p>
