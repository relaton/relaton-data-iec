abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-6:2021 applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies
    the requirements for CATV drop cables for analogue and digital one and two way
    signal transmission, e.g. for cable networks for television signals, sound signals,
    interactive services, surveillance & control systems, and satellite television
    receiving systems according to the requirements of IEC 60728-1, IEC 60728-1-1,
    IEC 60728-101, IEC 60728-10, ISO/IEC 11801-1 and ISO/IEC 11801-4. This also includes
    the transmission of BCT signals provided by a CATV, MATV or SMATV cable network.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- extended scope,<br />\r\n- revised sheath
