abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-200:2021+AMD1:2024 CSV is applicable to prefabricated metal‑enclosed
    switchgear and controlgear assemblies designed for:<br />\r\n- alternating current;<br
    />\r\n- rated voltages above 1 kV and up to and including 52 kV;<br />\r\n- service
    frequencies up to and including 60 Hz;<br />\r\n- indoor and outdoor installation.<br
    />\r\nThe assembly can include air-insulated and/or fluid-filled compartments.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) clause numbering aligned with IEC 62271‑1:2017, including the adoption
    of the subclause names of Clause 3;<br />\r\nb) in Clause 3 specific definitions
    are added for \"in service\", \"normal operating condition\" and \"normal use\";<br
    />\r\nc) internal arc testing on pole-mounted switchgear is taken out of this
    document, as it is now covered by the specific standard IEC 62271‑214:2019;<br
    />\r\nd) a more precise description of earthing circuit is given with the inclusion
    of ratings and test requirements;<br />\r\ne) number of mechanical tests on interlocks
    is reduced for type testing; a more precise description of forces to apply during
    type testing is given (refer to 7.102);<br />\r\nf) resistance measuring on main
    circuit is only needed before continuous current tests (as reference for routine
    tests) and no longer needed after this continuous current test. Rationale for
    this deletion is that this measured resistance does not mean anything; as the
    temperature rise test was just finished, a new temperature rise test will not
    give new information;<br />\r\ng) IEC 62271-100:2021, IEC 62271-103:2021, IEC
    62271-105:2021 and IEC 62271-106:2021 are referred to in the document;<br />\r\nh)
    IEC 62271‑107:2019 and IEC IEEE 62271‑37‑013:2015 are also considered in 7.101.2;<br
    />\r\ni) a more precise description of LSC category is given with the inclusion
    of an explanatory flowchart (Annex D);<br />\r\nj) examples not covered by the
    IAC test are transferred from Clause 6 to 9.103;<br />\r\nk) the term \"assembly\"
    is defined in Clause 3 and used as synonym for \"metal-enclosed switchgear and
    controlgear\" in this document;<br />\r\nl) \"metallic\" is replaced by \"metal\"
    where applicable;<br />\r\nm) 6.105 is now covered by 7.7;<br />\r\nn) a 1 s rule
    was introduced for Criterion 4 during IAC tests regarding hot gases versus glowing
    particles as cause of ignition;<br />\r\no) a more precise description of internal
    arc tests for switchgear with protrusions is given in Annex A."
