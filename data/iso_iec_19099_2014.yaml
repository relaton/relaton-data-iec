abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19099:2014 specifies the following: 1) Resource Allocation Profile,
    which sets the basic resource allocation pattern for resource pools, allocations,
    and setting data. It also defines the resource-pool-lifecycle management and relationships.
    2) System Virtualization Profile - an autonomous profile that specifies the minimum
    top-level object model needed for the representation of host systems and the discovery
    of hosted virtual computer systems. In addition, it specifies a service for the
    manipulation of virtual computer systems and their resources, including operations
    for the creation, deletion, and modification of virtual computer systems and operations
    for the addition or removal of virtual resources to or from virtual computer systems.
    3) Allocation Capabilities Profile, which extends the management capability of
    referencing profiles by adding the ability to represent the default, supported
    and range of property values for resource allocation requests for a given resource,
    and the mutability of properties in a Resource Allocation Setting Data instance.
    4) Processor Resource Virtualization Profile - a component profile that extends
    the management capabilities of the specialized profiles by adding the support
    to represent and manage the allocation of processor resources to virtual systems.
    5) Memory Resource Virtualization Profile - a component DMTF management profile
    that extends the management capabilities of the referencing profile by adding
    the support to represent and manage the allocation of memory to virtual systems.
    6) Storage Resource Virtualization Profile - a component profile that extends
    the management capabilities of the referencing profile by adding the support to
    represent and manage the allocation of storage to virtual systems. 7) Ethernet
    Port Resource Virtualization Profile - a component DMTF management profile that
    extends the management capabilities of the referencing profile by adding the support
    to represent and manage the allocation of Ethernet ports to virtual systems. 8)
    Virtual System Profile - an autonomous profile that defines the minimum object
    model needed to provide for the inspection of a virtual system and its components.
    In addition, it defines optional basic control operations for activating, deactivating,
    pausing, or suspending a virtual system. 9) Generic Device Resource Virtualization
    Profile - a concrete component profile that specializes the abstract Resource
    Allocation Profile and the abstract Allocation Capabilities Profile.'
