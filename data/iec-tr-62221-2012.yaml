  content: "IEC/TR 62221:2012(E) describes four methods (A, B, C and D) for the measurement
    of microbending sensitivity of optical fibres. These four methods are distinguished
    by the equipment being used for measurements and their applications:<br />\r\n-
    method A using an expandable drum and applies to category A1 and class B fibres;<br
    />\r\n- method B using a fixed diameter drum and applies to category A1 and class
    B fibres;<br />\r\n- method C using a plate and applied loads and applies to category
    A1 and class B fibres;<br />\r\n- method D using a \"basketweave\" wrap on a fixed
    diameter drum, and applies to category A1 and class B fibres. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2001, and constitutes a technical
    and editorial revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition
    are:<br />\r\n- updates related to B6 (bend-insensitive) category single-mode
    fibres;<br />\r\n- inclusion of a definition for microbending and general properties;<br
    />\r\n- expansion of general considerations;<br />\r\n- more details given for
    each method;<br />\r\n- addition of an Annex A. Key words: measurement of microbending
    sensitivity of optical fibres"
