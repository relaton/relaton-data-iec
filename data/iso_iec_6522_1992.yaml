abstract:
- content: "<p>The language defined is different from those of previous PL/I standards,
    although substantially upward compatible, at the source program and semantic level.
    The differences are summarized in appendix A. Specifies the syntax and semantics
    of conforming PL/I programs. Defines a conforming processor (or conforming implementation)
    only in terms of those conforming programs. The definition is accomplished by
    specifying a conceptual PL/I machine which translates and interprets intended
    PL/I programs.</p>"
