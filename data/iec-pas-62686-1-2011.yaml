  script: Latn
  content: IEC/PAS 62686-1:2011(E) defines the minimum requirements for general purpose
    'off the shelf' COTS integrated circuits and discrete semiconductors for high
    reliability applications. This PAS complements IEC/TS 62564-1. IEC/TS 62564-1
    is to be used for high reliability applications where additional manufacturer's
    data is required beyond the publicly available manufacturer published datasheets.
    This PAS is to be used wherever possible for components that typically can be
    applied to operate in high reliability applications within the manufacturers publicly
    available datasheet limits. It is recommended that this PAS be used in conjunction
    with IEC/TS 62239 for avionics applications.
