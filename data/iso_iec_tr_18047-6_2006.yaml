abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000 defines the air interfaces for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices used in item management applications. ISO/IEC 18000-6 defines the
    air interface for these devices operating at frequencies from 860 MHz to 960 MHz.The
    purpose of ISO/IEC TR 18047 is to provide test methods for conformance with the
    various parts of ISO/IEC 18000.Each part of ISO/IEC TR 18047 contains all measurements
    required to be made on a product in order to establish whether it conforms to
    the corresponding part of ISO/IEC 18000. For ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006, each interrogator
    needs to be assessed for operation with both types A and B, while each tag is
    only required to support at least one of the types A or B.It should be noted that
    measurement of tag and interrogator performance is covered by ISO/IEC TR 18046.ISO/IEC
    TR 18047-6:2006 defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio
    frequency identification devices (tags and interrogators) for item management
    with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-6, but does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.The test methods require
    only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented,
    be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further,
    application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general
    case.The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006
    are the following:type-specific conformance parameters including nominal values
    and tolerances;parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and
    inter-operability.The following are not included in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006:parameters
    that are already included in regulatory test requirements;high-level data encoding
    conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962). Unless otherwise
    specified, the tests in ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006 are to be applied exclusively
    to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-6.ISO/IEC TR 18047-6:2006
    also describes all necessary conformance tests.
