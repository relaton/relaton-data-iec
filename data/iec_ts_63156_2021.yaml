abstract:
- content: IEC TS 63156:2021 describes the procedure for evaluating the energy conversion
    performance of stand-alone or grid-connected power conversion equipment (PCE)
    used in PV systems. This procedure includes the calculation of inverter performance
    to anticipate the energy yield of PV systems. This evaluation method is based
    on standard power efficiency calculation procedures for PCE found in IEC 61683
    and IEC 62891, but provides additional methods for evaluating the expected overall
    energy efficiency for a particular location given solar load profiles. This document
    can be used as the energy evaluation method for PCE in IEC TS 61724-3, which defines
    a procedure for evaluating a PV systemâ€™s actual energy production relative to
    its modeled or expected performance.
