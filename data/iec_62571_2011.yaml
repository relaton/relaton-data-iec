abstract:
- content: IEC 62571:2011 defines requirements and provides recommendations to publishers,
    software developers, content providers, and hardware manufacturers for the data
    structure, usability requirements, playback systems and delivery systems for audiobooks
    in digital file format. It should be noted that throughout this International
    Standard, the term audiobook is defined as any audio file or collection of audio
    files of primarily spoken word content that are played in a linear or specified
    order. Therefore, spoken word audio with occasional music, a narration of newspaper
    articles, or other similar spoken word audio is assimilated to audiobooks in this
    standard. This bilingual version (2011-07) replaces the English version.
