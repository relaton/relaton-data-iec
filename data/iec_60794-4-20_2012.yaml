    IEC 60794-4-20:2012(E) is a family specification, covers optical telecommunication cables, commonly with single-mode fibres to be used primarily in overhead power lines applications. The cable may also be used in other overhead utility networks, such as for telephony or TV services. Requirements of the sectional specification IEC 60794-4 for aerial optical cables along electrical power lines are applicable to cables covered by this standard.
    Keywords: optical telecommunication cables, overhead power lines, ADSS
