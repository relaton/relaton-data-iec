  content: "IEC 62893-1:2017(E) specifies construction, dimensions and test requirements
    for cables with extruded insulation and sheath having a voltage rating of up to
    and including 0,6/1 kV AC or up to and including 1 500 V DC for flexible applications
    under harsh conditions for the power supply between the electricity supply point
    of the charging station and the electric vehicle (EV).<br />\r\nThe EV charging
    cable is intended to supply power and, if needed, communication (for details see
    the IEC 62196 series and IEC 61851-1) to an EV or plug-in hybrid vehicle (PHEV).
    The charging cables are applicable for charging modes 1 to 4 of IEC 61851-1. Ordinary
    duty cables with rated voltage 300/500 V are only permitted for charging mode
    1 of IEC 61851-1. Maximum conductor temperature for the cables in this part of
    IEC 62893 is 90 ºC.<br />\r\nThe particular types of cables are specified in IEC
    62893-3 (modes 1 to 3 for AC charging) and in the future IEC 62893-4 (mode 4 for
    DC charging).<br />\r\nThese parts are collectively referred to hereafter as “the
    particular specifications”.<br />\r\nThe test methods specified are given in IEC
    62893-2, IEC 60245-2, IEC 60332-1-2, IEC 62821-1:2015, Annex B, and in the relevant
    parts of IEC 60811, as listed in the normative references."
