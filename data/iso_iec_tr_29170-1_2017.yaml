abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29170-1:2017 recommends best practices for coding system evaluation
    of images and image sequences. ISO/IEC TR 29170-1:2017 defines a common vocabulary
    of terms for coding system evaluation and divides evaluation methods into three
    broad categories:<br />\r\na) subjective assessment;<br />\r\nb) objective assessment;<br
    />\r\nc) computational assessment.<br />\r\nIn addition to these broad assessment
    categories, this document discusses special care that is given for coding unusual
    imagery, e.g. high dynamic range or high colour depth.<br />\r\nA fourth assessment
    category, hardware complexity, is often important for real-time or computationally
    complex applications; however, it is outside the scope of this document."
