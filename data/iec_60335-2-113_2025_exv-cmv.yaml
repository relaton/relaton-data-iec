- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-113:2025 EXV and IEC 60335-2-113:2025 CMV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-113:2025 deals with the safety of beauty care appliances
    incorporating lasers or intense light sources for household and similar purposes,
    where their operation relies on contact with the skin, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances. This standard covers appliances with a light emitting surface less
    than 25 cm2. Appliances with a light emitting surface equal to or greater than
    25 cm2 are within the scope of IEC 60335-2-27. Appliances not intended for normal
    household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public such
    as appliances intended to be used in beauty salons and similar premises are also
    within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAppliances covered by the scope of
    this standard include but are not limited to:<br />\r\n– appliances for control
    of hair growth;<br />\r\n– appliances for skin and beauty care incorporating lasers
    or intense light sources (ILS).<br />\r\nAppliances incorporating lasers or intense
    light sources (ILS) either heat up hair follicles or skin tissue to produce thermal
    effects or to produce photo-biological effects from specific wavelengths.<br />\r\nAs
    far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by
    appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n– persons (including children)
    whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge
    prevents them from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br
    />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nIn many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances for medical purposes (IEC 60601);<br />\r\n–
    appliances for skin or hair care (IEC 60335-2-23, IEC 60335-2-115);<br />\r\n–
    appliances for nail hardening;<br />\r\n– appliances for skin exposure to optical
    radiation with a light emitting surface equal to or greater than 25 cm2 (IEC 60335-2-27).<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2016 and Amendment 1:2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) deletion
    or conversion of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 3.8.101, 3.8.104. 25.14);<br
    />\r\nc) addition of instruction to warn against use by or on children (7.12);<br
    />\r\nd) addition of instructions for use of appliances intended for use only
    in beauty salons and similar premises (7.12);<br />\r\ne) addition of accessible
    surface temperature limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nf) clarification that test probe
    18 is not applied for appliances intended only for use in beauty salons and similar
    premises (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\ng) updating reference for evaluation
    of stray optical radiation to IEC 62471-7 (22.109, 32.102);<br />\r\nh) expansion
    of Table B.2 and Table B.3 to include more precise specifications for cells with
    a capacity between 0,2 Ah and 5 Ah;<br />\r\ni) Adding power supply requirements
    (21.102, 21.103, 24.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
