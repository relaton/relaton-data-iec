abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 10995:2008 specifies an accelerated aging test method for estimating
    the life expectancy for the retrievability of information stored on recordable
    or rewritable optical disks.This test includes details on the following formats:
    DVD-R/-RW/-RAM, +R/+RW. It may be applied to additional optical disk formats with
    the appropriate specification substitutions and may be updated by committee in
    the future as required.ISO/IEC 10995:2008 includes the following:stress conditions;assumptions;ambient
    conditions:controlled storage condition, e.g. 25 °C and 50% RH, using Eyring model,uncontrolled
    storage condition, e.g. 30 °C and 80% RH, using Arrhenius model;evaluation system
    description;specimen preparation; data acquisition procedure;data interpretation.The
    methodology includes only the effects of temperature (T) and relative humidity
    (RH). It does not attempt to model degradation due to complex failure mechanism
    kinetics, nor does it test for exposure to light, corrosive gases, contaminants,
    handling, and variations in playback subsystems. Disks exposed to these additional
    sources of stress or higher levels of T and RH are expected to experience shorter
    usable lifetimes.'
