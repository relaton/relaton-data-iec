  content: "<p>The medium access control (MAC) and physical characteristics for wireless
    local area networks (LANs) are specified in ISO/IEC 8802-11:2005, which is part
    of a series of standards for local and metropolitan area networks. The medium
    access control unit in ISO/IEC 8802-11:2005 is designed to support physical layer
    units as they may be adopted dependent on the availability of spectrum. ISO/IEC
    8802-11:2005 contains five physical layer units: four radio units, operating in
    the 2400-2500 MHz band and in the bands comprising 5.15-5.25 GHz, 5.25-5.35 GHz,
    and 5.725-5.825 GHz, and one baseband infrared (IR) unit. One radio unit employs
    the frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) technique, two employ the direct
    sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) technique, and another employs the orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technique.</p>"
