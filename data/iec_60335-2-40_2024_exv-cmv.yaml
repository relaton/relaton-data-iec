abstract:
- content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-40:2024 EXV and IEC 60355-2-40:2024 CMV.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-40:2024 deals with the safety of electric heat pumps,
    sanitary hot water heat pumps and air conditioners, incorporating motor-compressors
    as well as hydronic fan coils units, dehumidifiers (with or without motor-compressors),
    thermoelectric heat pumps and partial units, their maximum rated voltage being
    not more than 300 V for single phase appliances and 600 V for other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br
    />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laypersons in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of
    this standard.<br />\r\nThe appliances referenced above can consist of one or
    more factory-made assemblies. If provided in more than one assembly, the separate
    assemblies are used together, and the requirements are based on the use of matched
    assemblies.<br />\r\nA definition of ‘motor-compressor’ is given in IEC 60335-2-34,
    which includes the statement that the term motor-compressor is used to designate
    either a hermetic motor-compressor or semi-hermetic motor-compressor.<br />\r\nRequirements
    for containers intended for storage of the heated water included in sanitary hot
    water heat pumps are, in addition, covered by IEC 60335-2-21.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not take into account refrigerants other than group A1, A2L, A2 and A3 as
    defined by ISO 817. Flammable refrigerants are limited to those of a molar mass
    of more than or equal to 42 kg/kmol based on WCF (worst case formulation) as specified
    in ISO 817.<br />\r\nAs far as practical, this standard deals with common hazards
    presented by appliances that are encountered in normal use and assumes that installation,
    servicing, decommissioning, and disposal are safely handled by competent persons
    and accidental release of refrigerants is avoided. However, it does not specify
    the criteria to ensure competence of persons during installation, servicing and
    disposal. Safety requirements during disposal are not specified in this standard.<br
    />\r\nAnnex HH provides informative requirements on competence of personnel. Criteria
    for competence of personnel for the purpose of certification schemes can be found
    in ISO 22712.<br />\r\nUnless specifications are covered by this standard, including
    the annexes, requirements for refrigerating safety are covered by:<br />\r\n–
    ISO 5149-1:2014, ISO 5149-1:2014/AMD1:2015, and ISO 5149-1:2014/AMD2:2021,<br
    />\r\n– ISO 5149-2:2014 and ISO 5149-2:2014/AMD1:2020,<br />\r\n– ISO 5149-3:2014
    and ISO 5149-3:2014/AMD1:2021.<br />\r\nSupplementary heaters, or a provision
    for their separate installation, are within the scope of this standard, but only
    heaters which are designed as a part of the appliance package, the controls being
    incorporated in the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified, for example, by the national health authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and the national authorities responsible for storage,
    transportation, building constructions and installations.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n– humidifiers intended for use with heating and cooling
    equipment (IEC 60335-2-88);<br />\r\n– appliances designed exclusively for industrial
    processing;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis eighth edition cancels and replaces the seventh
    edition published in 2022. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) Clause 12: Part 1, Clause 12 has been made applicable;<br
    />\r\nb) Clause 19: requirement added for double wall heat exchangers to be resistant
    against freezing;<br />\r\nc) Clause 20: requirement modified for when to apply
    test probe 18;<br />\r\nd) Clause 21: requirement added for double wall heat exchangers
    to resistant against the pressure of the refrigerant if one of the walls fails;<br
    />\r\ne) Clause 22: requirement modified to reflect that appliances can operate
    continuously and can be operated remotely without giving rise to a hazard, and
    requirement added for double wall heat exchangers to be constructed to avoid refrigerant
    leaking into the secondary circuit;<br />\r\nf) Annex LL has been deleted and
    replaced by a reference to IEC TS 63542:2024.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
