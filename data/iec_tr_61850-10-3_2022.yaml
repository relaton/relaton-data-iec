abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-10-3:2022(E), which is a technical report, is applicable
    to testing of applications within substations. It is intended to give practical
    guidelines to perform the stages of quality assurance defined in IEC 61850-4:2011.
    However, while the quality assurance in that document begins with the IED manufacturer
    development stage and focuses on the role of the system integrator this document
    focuses on end-user requirement fulfilment.<br />\r\nThe report may be useful
    to users applying IEC 61850 to other domains, however testing of IEC 61850 systems
    outside the substation domain is not within the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis
    document describes:<br />\r\n• A methodical approach to the verification and validation
    of a substation solution<br />\r\n• The use of IEC 61850 resources for testing
    in Edition 2.1<br />\r\n• Recommended testing practices for different use cases<br
    />\r\n• Definition of the process for testing of IEC 61850 based devices and systems
    using communications instead of hard wired system interfaces (ex. GOOSE and SV
    instead of hardwired interfaces)<br />\r\n• Use cases related to protection and
    control functions verification and testing<br />\r\nThis document does not cover
    the conformance testing of devices according to IEC 61850-10 or methodologies
    for testing of abstract device independent functions."
