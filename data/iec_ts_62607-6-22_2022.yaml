abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-22:2022 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristic\r\n\r\n\tash content\r\n\r\nof powder and dispersion
    of graphene-based material by\r\n\r\n\r\n\tincineration.\r\n\r\nThe ash content
    is derived by residue obtained after incineration under the operating conditions
    specified in this document, being divided by the mass of the dried test portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe
    method is applicable for graphene, graphene oxide and reduced graphene oxide in
    forms of both dry powder and dispersion. This document can be used as reference
    for graphite oxide and other modified graphene.\r\n\tTypical application areas
    of this method are research, manufacturer and downstream user to guide material
    processing and quality control."
