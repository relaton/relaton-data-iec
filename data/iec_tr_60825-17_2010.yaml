abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 60825-17:2010(E) recommends safety measures to protect against effects
    caused exclusively by thermal, opto-mechanical and related effects in passive
    optical components and optical cables used in high optical power fibre communication
    systems. IEC/TR 60825-17:2010 does not apply to the use of high power optical
    systems in explosive atmospheres or the use of optical fibres in material processing
    machines. Throughout this part of IEC 60825, a reference to 'laser' is taken to
    include light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and optical amplifiers.
