  content: 'IEC/TR 61282-4:2013(E) which is a technical report, is intended to describe
    physically and analytically non-linear effects in fibre optic systems, their impact
    on system performance, and ways of minimizing the effects or using them to advantage.
    It contains some of ITU-T Recommendation G.663 with additional material. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2003, and
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical change with respect to the previous edition: clarifications on the compensation
    for nonlinear impairments with digital signal processing. Key words: physically
    and analytically non-linear effects in fibre optic systems'
