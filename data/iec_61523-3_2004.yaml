abstract:
- content: The Standard Delay Format (SDF)is an existing OVI standard for the representation
    and interpretation of timing data for use at any stage of the electronic design
    process.The ASCII data in the SDF le is represented in a tool and language independent
    way and includes path delays,timing constraint values,inter-connect delays and
    high level technology parameters. This standard is published with a double logo
    IEC-IEEE. standard.
