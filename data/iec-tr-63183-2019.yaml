  content: "IEC TR 63183:2019 provides guidance on the usage and form of error or
    warning messages written for software used in RADIOTHERAPY. It does not replace
    any requirements existing in the safety standards but is meant to be used as a
    supplement to existing standards on usability by providing specific examples in
    the field of RADIOTHERAPY.<br />\r\nThe two main goals of this document are<br
    />\r\n1) to present in a concise manner the best practices and design guidelines
    for good message dialogs, and<br />\r\n2) to illustrate these design guidelines
    with specific examples from the field of radiation oncology.<br />\r\nThis document
    is intended to be read by the following MANUFACTURERS’ employees and representatives:<br
    />\r\n– engineering department members including: software engineers, RISK managers,
    quality assurance engineers, technical writers, etc.;<br />\r\n– usability and
    human factors engineers;<br />\r\n– marketing representatives (product marketing,
    product managers, business analysts).<br />\r\nThroughout this document, unless
    specifically called out, these guidelines apply to all categories of messages
    summarily called error or warning messages (e.g. critical error, warning, system
    status, informational, routine interlock messages)."
