  content: "This pack contains IEC 60335-2-108:2024 EXV and IEC 60335-2-108:2024 RLV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-108:2024 deals with the safety of electrolysers that
    produce low viscosity, ionized liquids intended for use as detergent free wash
    water in appliances for household and similar purposes and which conform with
    the standards applicable to such appliances. It applies to electrolysers tested
    separately, under the most severe conditions that can be expected to occur in
    normal use, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current
    (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of
    appliances that can contain electrolysers are:<br />\r\n- dishwashers (IEC 60335-2-5);<br
    />\r\n- washing machines (IEC 60335-2-7);<br />\r\n- appliances producing wash
    water for hygiene purposes.<br />\r\nThis standard does not supersede the requirements
    of standards relevant to the particular appliance in which the electrolyser is
    used. However, if the electrolyser used complies with this standard, the tests
    for the electrolyser specified in the particular appliance standard can be unnecessary
    in the particular appliance or assembly. If the electrolyser control system is
    associated with the particular appliance control system, additional tests can
    be necessary on the final appliance. Guidance for additional requirements to be
    considered for inclusion in the end product standards for appliances that use
    electrolysers is given in informative Annex BB.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to
    the fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on
    board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health
    authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour,
    the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes
    have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 22.012);<br />\r\nc) application
    of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2, B22.3, B22.4);<br />\r\nd)
    addition of external accessible surface temperatures (Clause 11).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/61880\">IEC
    60335-1:2020</a> and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that
    case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established
    on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
