abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the process assessment model (PAM). It contains
    process definitions of the ITES-BPO lifecycle defined in ISO/IEC 30105-1 and a
    model suitable for assessing process capability. The outcomes in the PAM are clearly
    defined, observable results, aligned to the business benefits derived by the customer
    and service provider.<br />\r\nA PAM consists of a set of indicators for process
    performance and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting
    the objective evidence that enables an assessor to determine ratings. The set
    of indicators included in this document is not intended to be an all-inclusive
    set, nor is it intended to be applicable in its entirety. Supersets and subsets
    are selected according to the context and the scope of the assessment.<br />\r\nThe
    PAM in this document is directed at assessment sponsors and competent assessors
    who wish to select a model and an associated documented assessment process for
    the ITES-BPO lifecycle processes, for process capability gap determination."
