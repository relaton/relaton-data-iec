    ISO/IEC 29167-13:2015 defines the Crypto Suite for Grain-128A for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interface standards for radio frequency identification (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for RFID devices that might be referred by ISO committees for air interface standards and application standards

    ISO/IEC 29167-13:2015 specifies a crypto suite for Grain-128A for air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite is defined in alignment with existing air interfaces.

    ISO/IEC 29167-13:2015 defines various authentication methods and methods of use for the cipher. A tag and an interrogator might support one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported.
