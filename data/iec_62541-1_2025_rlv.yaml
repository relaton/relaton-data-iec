abstract:
- content: "IEC 62541-1:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and TR 62541-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62541-1:2025 presents
    the concepts and overview of the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA). Reading this
    document is helpful to understand the remaining parts of the IEC 62541 series.
    Each of the other parts is briefly explained along with a suggested reading order.
    This first edition cancels and replaces IEC TR 62541-1 published in 2020."
