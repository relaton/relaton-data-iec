abstract:
- content: "The VMEbus specification defines an interfacing system used to interconnect
    microprocessors, data storage and peripheral control devices in a closely-coupled
    hardware configuration. Its objectives include allowing communication between
    devices on the VMEbus without disturbing the internal activities of other devices
    on the VMEbus, allowing a broad range of design latitude so that the designer
    can optimize cost and&#x2F;or performance without affecting system compatibility,
    and providing a system where performance is primarily device-limited rather than
    system-interface-limited.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nNote that this
    publication is available not in paper form but as a CD-ROM."
