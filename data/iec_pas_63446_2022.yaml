abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 63446:2022, a Publicly Available Specification, provides the method
    to conservatively evaluate the area averaged electromagnetic (EM) power density
    entering the human body, i.e. the absorbed power density (APD), for communication
    devices intended to be used at a position near the human head or body, or mounted
    on the body, combined with other transmitters within a product, or embedded in
    garments. The device categories covered include but are not limited to mobile
    telephones, radio transmitters in personal computers, and desktop and laptop devices.
    The applicable frequency range is from 6 GHz to 10 GHz.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies:\r\n \r\n\t conversion of the psSAR to the psAPD (Clause 6); \r\n\t
    uncertainty estimation (Clause 7); \r\n\t reporting requirements (Clause 8); \r\n\t
    methods of validation and system check (Annex C)"
