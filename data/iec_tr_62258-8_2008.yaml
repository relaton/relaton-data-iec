abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62258-8:2008(E), which is a technical report, has been developed
    to facilitate the production, supply and use of semiconductor die products, including
    wafers; singulated bare die; die and wafers with attached connection structures;
    minimally or partially encapsulated die and wafers. This Technical Report contains
    an EXPRESS model schema that describes the elements needed for data exchange and
    that will allow the implementation of the requirements of the IEC 62258-1, IEC
    62258-5 and IEC 62258-6 standards, as well as providing an exchange structure
    that is complementary to those defined in IEC 62258-2. It is also complementary
    to and compatible with the questionnaire in IEC 62258-4.
