abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 27099:2022 This document sets out a framework of requirements
    to manage information security for Public key infrastructure (PKI) trust service
    providers through certificate policies, certificate practice statements, and,
    where applicable, their internal underpinning by an information security management
    system (ISMS). The framework of requirements includes the assessment and treatment
    of information security risks, tailored to meet the agreed service requirements
    of its users as specified through the certificate policy. This document is also
    intended to help trust service providers to support multiple certificate policies.<br
    />\r\nThis document addresses the life cycle of public key certificates that are
    used for digital signatures, authentication, or key establishment for data encryption.
    It does not address authentication methods, non-repudiation requirements, or key
    management protocols based on the use of public key certificates. For the purposes
    of this document, the term “certificate” refers to public key certificates. This
    document is not applicable to attribute certificates.<br />\r\nThis document uses
    concepts and requirements of an ISMS as defined in the ISO/IEC 27000 family of
    standards. It uses the code of practice for information security controls as defined
    in ISO/IEC 27002. Specific PKI requirements (e.g. certificate content, identity
    proofing, certificate revocation handling) are not addressed directly by an ISMS
    such as defined by ISO/IEC 27001 [26].<br />\r\nThe use of an ISMS or equivalent
    is adapted to the application of PKI service requirements specified in the certificate
    policy as described in this document.<br />\r\nA PKI trust service provider is
    a special class of trust service for the use of public key certificates.<br />\r\nThis
    document draws a distinction between PKI systems used in closed, open and contractual
    environments. This document is intended to facilitate the implementation of operational,
    baseline controls and practices in a contractual environment. While the focus
    of this document is on the contractual environment, application of this document
    to open or closed environments is not specifically precluded."
