  content: "IEC 61969-3:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61969-3:2020
    specifies a set of basic environmental requirements and tests, as well as safety
    aspects for outdoor enclosures under conditions of non-weather protected locations
    above ground. The purpose of this document is to define a minimum level of environmental
    performance in order to meet requirements of storage, transport and final installation.
    The intention is to establish basic environmental performance criteria for outdoor
    enclosure compliance. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- alignment with the content of ETSI EN 300 019 and IEC 60721
    series latest editions, particularly with the actualization of climate conditions;<br
    />\r\n- new requirements added to reflect market requirements on environmental
    issues;<br />\r\n- improvement on terminology and overall editorial improvement."
