  content: "IEC 61558-2-12:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-12:2024
    deals with the safety of constant voltage transformers for general applications
    and power supply units for constant voltage for general applications. Constant
    voltage transformers incorporating electronic circuits are also covered by this
    document.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) adjustment of structure and references in accordance
    with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\nb) description of constructions moved to IEC 61558-1:2017;<br
    />\r\nc) new symbol for power supply unit with linearly regulated output voltage.<br
    />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide
    104."
