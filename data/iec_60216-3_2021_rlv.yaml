abstract:
- content: "IEC 60216-3:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60216-3:2021
    specifies the calculation procedures used for deriving thermal endurance characteristics
    from experimental data obtained in accordance with the instructions of IEC 60216-1
    and IEC 60216-2, using fixed ageing temperatures and variable ageing times. The
    experimental data can be obtained using non-destructive, destructive or proof
    tests. Data obtained from non-destructive or proof tests can be incomplete, in
    that it is possible that measurement of times taken to reach the end-point will
    have been terminated at some point after the median time but before all specimens
    have reached end-point. The procedures are illustrated by worked examples, and
    suitable computer programs are recommended to facilitate the calculations.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- a new computer program has been included;<br
    />\r\n- Annex E \" has been completely reworked."
