abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014 defines interfaces for device management of radio
    frequency identification (RFID) systems. Interfaces are defined that provide for
    discovery, configuration, initialization and monitoring of RFID systems within
    the Software System Infrastructure (SSI).</p><p>It only deals with devices that
    provide RFID related services. It does not distinguish the form factor of such
    RFID devices.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014 provides two distinct interface sets,
    one based on the EPCglobal Discovery, Configuration, and Initialization (DCI)
    standard and the IETF SNMP RFCs and the other based on the Organization for the
    Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) Device Profile for Web
    Services (DPWS) standard. The definition of the Device Profile for RFID is referred
    to in ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014 as the RFID Device Management Profile, or RDMP.</p><p>Each
    interface option set provides interface definitions that provide ISO/IEC 24791-3
    Client Endpoints and Services Endpoints with the mechanisms for:</p><ul><li>discovery
    of the RFID devices and services on a local or remote subnet;</li><li>a firmware
    upgrade service;</li><li>a management service that implements configuration related
    functions;</li><li>a monitoring service for reporting alerts, diagnostics, and
    performance information.</li></ul><p>The two interface set definitions provided
    by ISO/IEC 24791-3:2014 allow for clients and services endpoints to implement
    and provide the services based on the specific characteristics of the RFID system
    to be implemented.</p>"
