abstract:
- content: "1.1 Fields of application<br />\r\nThis document provides management and
    engineering guidance within the Intermediate profile for the Business Management,
    Project Management, System Definition and Realisation and Acquisition Management
    processes.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs).
    VSEs are enterprises, organisations, departments or projects having up to 25 people.
    The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended
    to preclude or discourage their use by organisations bigger than VSEs.<br />\r\nThis
    document has been developed using the management and engineering guide from the
    systems engineering Basic profile. Elements were added or modified (e.g. process,
    task, work product, role) to support VSEs involved in the development of more
    than one project in parallel with more than one work team.<br />\r\nThis guide
    is oriented towards the management of more than one project in parallel with more
    than one work team.<br />\r\nThis document applies for the development of non-critical
    systems.<br />\r\nUsing this document, a VSE can obtain benefits in the following
    aspects:<br />\r\n— An agreed set of project requirements (technical part of contract)
    and expected work products are agreed by the Acquirer.<br />\r\n— A disciplined
    management process, that provides project visibility and corrective actions of
    project problems and deviations, is performed.<br />\r\n— A systematic System
    Definition and Realisation process, that satisfies Acquirer needs and helps ensure
    quality work products, is followed.<br />\r\nOnce the system, developed by a VSE,
    has been accepted by their customers, the VSE that wants to provide after delivery
    services can refer to ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3.<br />\r\nIn the context of systems
    engineering, that is the System Definition and Realisation (SR) process, the group
    that is part of the VSE responsible for developing software elements that are
    part of the system are encouraged to use the management and engineering guide
    of the software engineering Intermediate profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3).<br
    /><br />\r\n1.2 Target audience<br />\r\nThis document is targeted at VSEs that
    do not develop critical systems and have little or no experience with systems
    engineering (SE) process planning and implementation using ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288.<br
    />\r\nThis document is also targeted to VSEs which are familiar with management
    and engineering guide of the systems engineering Basic profile (ISO/IEC TR 29110
    5-6-2) for their system development projects and are involved in the development
    of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.<br />\r\nThis
    document is intended to be used with any processes, techniques and methods that
    enhance the VSE's Stakeholder satisfaction and productivity."
