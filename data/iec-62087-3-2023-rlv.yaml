  content: "IEC 62087-3:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62087-3:2023
    specifies the determination of the power consumption and related characteristics
    of television sets. Television sets include, but are not limited to, those with
    LCD, OLED, or projection technologies. The operating modes and functions, as they
    specifically apply to television sets, are defined in detail in this part of IEC
    62087. This document is limited to television sets that can be connected to an
    external power source. Television sets that include a non-removable, main battery
    are not covered by this document. Television sets can include any number of auxiliary
    batteries. The measuring conditions in this document represent the normal use
    of the equipment and can differ from specific conditions, for example as specified
    in safety standards. IEC 62087-3:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) it introduces measuring procedures for the determination of power consumption
    in the On mode while viewing static metadata HDR video content;<br />\r\nb) all
    tests for On mode power determination are performed with MDD disabled;<br />\r\nc)
    only progressive video signals are used for testing;<br />\r\nd) a dimmable LED
    reflector lamp is used as a light source for illuminating the ABC sensor to achieve
    specific illuminance levels;<br />\r\ne) a dynamic box and outline video signal
    is used for determining the ratio of peak luminance."
