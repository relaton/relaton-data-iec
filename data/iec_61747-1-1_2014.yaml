abstract:
- content: "IEC 61747-1-1:2014 is a generic specification for liquid crystal display
    devices. It defines general procedures for testing and gives general rules for
    the measuring methods of the electrical and optical characteristics, the rules
    for climatic and mechanical tests, and the rules for endurance tests. This first
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition of IEC 61747-1 published in 1998
    and Amendment 1:2003. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) IEC 61747-1, has been divided into IEC 61747-1-1, Liquid
    crystal display devices - Part 1-1: Generic - Generic specification and IEC 61747-1-2,
    Liquid crystal display devices - Part 1-2: Generic - Terminology and letter symbols;<br
    />\r\nb) the contents of the terminology have been transferred to IEC 61747-1-2;<br
    />\r\nc) Annex C has been changed from normative to informative, because Tables
    C.1 and C.2 mismatch some of the large scale production practices of recent date;<br
    />\r\nd) References cited have been updated."
