abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60146-1-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC TR 60146-1-2:2019 gives
    guidance on variations to the specifications given in IEC 60146-1-1:2009 to enable
    the specification to be extended in a controlled form for special cases. Background
    information is also given on technical points, which facilitates the use of IEC
    60146-1-1:2009. This technical report primarily covers line commutated converters
    and is not in itself a specification, except as regards certain auxiliary components,
    in so far as existing standards may not provide the necessary data. This fifth
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of annexes concerning the applications
    of converter transformers and of fuses for overcurrent protection;<br />\r\nb)
    changes of calculation methods related the inductive voltage regulation and changes
    of description on transformer losses to be consistent with the latest transformer
    standards;<br />\r\nc) addition and updates of references based on the latest
    information.</p>"
