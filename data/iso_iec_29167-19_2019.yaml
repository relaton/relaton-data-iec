abstract:
- content: "This document defines the Rabin-Montgomery (RAMON) crypto suite for the
    ISO/IEC 18000 series of air interfaces standards for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices. Its purpose is to provide a common crypto suite for security for
    RFID devices that can be referred to by ISO/IEC for air interface standards and
    application standards.<br />\r\nThis document specifies a crypto suite for Rabin-Montgomery
    (RAMON) for air interface for RFID systems. The crypto suite is defined in alignment
    with existing air interfaces.<br />\r\nThis document defines various authentication
    methods and methods of use for the cipher. A Tag and an Interrogator can support
    one, a subset, or all of the specified options, clearly stating what is supported."
