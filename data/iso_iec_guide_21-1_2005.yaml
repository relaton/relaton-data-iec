- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 21-1:2005 provides methods for: determination of the degree
    of correspondence between regional or national standards and relevant International
    Standards; adoption of International Standards as regional or national standards;
    indication of technical deviations which would facilitate immediate recognition
    of any deviation; numbering of regional or national standards that are identical
    adoptions of International Standards; indication of the degree of correspondence
    between the regional or national standard and the International Standard.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 21-1:2005 does not contain any rules for the use of an International
    Standard in production, trade, legislation or similar activities. It also does
    not deal with: the adoption of regional or national standards as International
    Standards; adoption of regional or national standards as other regional or national
    standards; adoption of regional standards as national standards; or adoption in
    or of technical regulations."
