    <p>Since CASE (computer aided software engineering) adoption is a subject of the broader technology transition problem, ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 addresses the adoption practices appropriate for a wide range of computing organizations. ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 neither dictates nor advocates particular development standards, software processes, design methods, methodologies, techniques, programming languages, or life-cycle paradigms.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 will:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>identify critical success factors (CSF);</li>
    <li>propose a set of adoption processes;</li>
    <li>guide successful adoption in consideration of organizational and cultural environment.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following groups are targeted as potential audiences:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>CASE users;</li>
    <li>information systems managers;</li>
    <li>chief information officers (CIO);</li>
    <li>CASE suppliers;</li>
    <li>software engineering consultants;</li>
    <li>those involved in the acquisition of CASE tools and technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Therefore ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 addresses aspects of CASE tools adoption. It is best used in conjunction with ISO/IEC 14102 for CASE tool evaluation and selection. It is complementary to related ISO/IEC documents which deal with the general aspects of these topics.</p>
    <p>The purpose of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 is to provide a recommended practice for CASE adoption. It provides guidance in establishing processes and activities that are to be applied for the successful adoption of CASE technology. The use of ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 will help to maximize the return and minimize the risk of investing in CASE technology. However, ISO/IEC TR 14471:2007 does not establish compliance criteria.</p>
