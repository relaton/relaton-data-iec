    <p>ISO/IEC 19761:2003 specifies the set of definitions, conventions and activities of the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement Method. It is applicable to software from the following functional domains:</p>
    <ol><li>application software which is needed to support business administration;</li><li>real-time software, the task of which is to keep up with or control events happening in the real world;</li><li>hybrids of the above.</li></ol>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19761:2003 has not been designed for measuring the functional size of a piece of software, or its parts, which:</p>
    <ol><li>are characterized by complex mathematical algorithms or other specialized and complex rules, such as may be found in expert systems, simulation software, self-learning software and weather forecasting systems, or</li><li>process continuous variables such as audio sounds or video images, such as may be found, for instance, in computer game software, musical instruments and the like.</li></ol>
    <p>However, within the local environment of an organisation using the COSMIC-FFP Functional Size Measurement Method, it may be possible to measure these FUR in a way which is meaningful as a local standard. ISO/IEC 19761:2003 contains provision for the local customisation of the method for this purpose.</p>
