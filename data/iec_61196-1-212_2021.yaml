abstract:
- content: IEC 61196-1-212:2021 describes three methods to determine the UV resistance
    of sheath materials for electric and optical fibre cables. These tests apply for
    outdoor and indoor cable applications according to the product standard. The samples
    of sheath are taken from the finished cables. Although this test method is written
    principally for communication cables, it can be used for energy cables if called
    up by the relevant product standard.
