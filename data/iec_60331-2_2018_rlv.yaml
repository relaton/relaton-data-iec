abstract:
- content: "IEC 60331-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60331-2:2018
    specifies the test method for cables which are required to maintain circuit integrity
    when subject to fire and mechanical shock under specified conditions. This document
    is applicable to cables of rated voltage not exceeding 600 V/1 000 V, including
    those of rated voltage below 80 V, metallic data and telecom cables and optical
    fibre cables. It is intended for use when testing cables of not greater than 20
    mm overall diameter. Cables of larger diameter are intended to be tested using
    the apparatus, procedure and requirements of IEC 60331-1. This document includes
    details for the specific point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test
    sample, test procedure and test report relevant to electric power and control
    cables with rated voltage up to and including 600 V/1000 V. Details for the specific
    point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample, test procedure
    and test report relevant to metallic data and telecom cables and optical fibre
    cables are not given by IEC 60331-2. Although the scope is restricted to cables
    with rated voltage up to and including 0,6/1,0 kV, the procedure can be used,
    with the agreement of the manufacturer and the purchaser, for cables with rated
    voltage up to and including 1,8/3 (3,3) kV, provided that suitable fuses are used.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009.
    It constitutes a technical revision. The significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n– extension of the scope with
    metallic data and telecom cables and optical fibre cables, although details for
    the specific point of failure, continuity checking arrangement, test sample, test
    procedure and test report relevant to metallic data and telecom cables and optical
    fibre cables are not given by IEC 60331-2;<br />\r\n– improved description of
    the test environment;<br />\r\n– mandatory use of mass flow meters/controllers
    as the means of controlling accurately the input flow rates of fuel and air to
    the burner;<br />\r\n– improved figure illustrating method of mounting of the
    sample regarding bending radius;<br />\r\n– improved description of the information
    to be included in the test report."
