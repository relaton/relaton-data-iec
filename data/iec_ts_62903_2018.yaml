abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62903:2018, which is a Technical Specification,<br />\r\na) establishes
    the free-field convergent spherical wave self-reciprocity method for ultrasonic
    transducer calibration,<br />\r\nb) establishes the measurement conditions and
    experimental procedure required to determine the transducer's electroacoustic
    parameters and acoustic output power using the self-reciprocity method,<br />\r\nc)
    establishes the criteria for checking the reciprocity of these transducers and
    the linear range of the focused field, and<br />\r\nd) provides guiding information
    for the assessment of the overall measurement uncertainties for radiation conductance.<br
    />\r\nThis document is applicable to:<br />\r\ni) circular spherically curved
    concave focusing transducers without a centric hole working in the linear amplitude
    range,<br />\r\nii) measurements in the frequency range 0,5 MHz to 15 MHz, and<br
    />\r\niii) acoustic pressure amplitudes in the focused field within the linear
    amplitude range."
