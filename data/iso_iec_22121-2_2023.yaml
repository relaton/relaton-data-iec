abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 22121-2:2023 This document specifies the design and specification
    of on-screen keyboards (keyboards that are displayed on a screen) with direct
    touch interface, including those with some audio feedback.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies keyboard layouts designed for on-screen keyboards with direct touch
    interface and ways for interaction with them.<br />\r\nIt is not applicable to
    virtual keyboards that are not displayed on a screen, and on-screen keyboards
    that do not provide a direct touchscreen interface such as on-screen keyboards
    relying on an accessory unit like a trackpad or a remote control for interactions
    with the user.<br />\r\nIt is not applicable to physical keyboards that use real
    or adaptable keys, which can be customized to user needs, for example, with LCD
    display."
