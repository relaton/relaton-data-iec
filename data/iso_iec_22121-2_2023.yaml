    and on-screen keyboards that do not provide a direct touchscreen interface such
    as on-screen keyboards relying on an accessory unit like a trackpad or a remote
    control for interactions with the user.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align:
    none; text-autospace: none;">It is not applicable to physical keyboards that use
    real or adaptable keys, which can be customized to user needs, for example, with
    LCD display.</p>'
