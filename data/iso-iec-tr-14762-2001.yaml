  content: This technical report gives guidelines for functional safety of electrically-controlled
    devices intended to be integrated in a home control system (HCS). It gives guidance
    to product committees, so that they can specify products using home control systems,
    on the default actions a device should take when it loses network access, and
    on the definition of the safe state of the product. Concerned are the safety of
    persons, surroundings, livestock and domestic animals; personal protection against
    electric shock, effects of excessive temperature, radiation, explosion, implosion,
    mechanical stability and moving parts, as well as protection against fire. Safety
    both in homes and in non-industrial buildings is covered.
