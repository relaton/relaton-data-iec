abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    part of ISO/IEC 11579 specifies a reference configuration (RC) for the extension
    line of a private integrated services network exchange (PINX) including high level
    functions in addition to the physical termination system specified in part 1 of
    ISO/IEC 11579.<br />\r\nSince such high level functions appear application dependent
    and can occur, in principle, in any multiplicity and combination, no firm allocation
    of functional groupings and thus no firm reference points can be indicated. Instead,
    the principles for combining functional groupings associated with the physical
    termination system and allocating reference points are specified in this part
    of ISO/IEC 11579.<br />\r\nExamples for some combinations of functional groupings
    and the allocation of reference points are given in annex A.<br />\r\nThe principle
    is not intended to require any specific implementation of a PINX, but only to
    provide guidance for the specification of PINX capabilities.<br />\r\nThe principle
    is sufficient to support ISDN-like applications. It can be extended to also support
    non-ISDN-like applications."
