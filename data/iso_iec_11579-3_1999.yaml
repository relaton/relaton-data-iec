abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 11579 specifies a reference configuration (RC)
    for the extension line of a private integrated</p><p>services network exchange
    (PINX) including high level functions in addition to the physical termination
    system</p><p>specified in part 1 of ISO/IEC 11579.</p><p>Since such high level
    functions appear application dependent and can occur, in principle, in any multiplicity
    and</p><p>combination, no firm allocation of functional groupings and thus no
    firm reference points can be indicated. Instead,</p><p>the principles for combining
    functional groupings associated with the physical termination system and allocating</p><p>reference
    points are specified in this part of ISO/IEC 11579.</p><p>Examples for some combinations
    of functional groupings and the allocation of reference points are given in</p><p>annex
    A.</p><p>The principle is not intended to require any specific implementation
    of a PINX, but only to provide guidance for the</p><p>specification of PINX capabilities.</p><p>The
    principle is sufficient to support ISDN-like applications. It can be extended
    to also support non-ISDN-like</p><p>applications.</p>"
