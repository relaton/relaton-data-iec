abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61400-26-3:2016(E) provides a framework from which time-based and
    production-based availability indicators of a wind power station can be derived.
    It unambiguously describes how data is categorised and provides examples of how
    the data can be used to derive availability indicators. The approach is to apply
    the terms and definitions for the applied information models introduced in IEC
    TS 61400-26-1 and IEC TS 61400-26-2 to a wind power station.
