  content: "<p>IEC 60112:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60112:2025 edition 6.0 and the previous IEC 60112:2020
    edition 5.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 112 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60112:2025 specifies the method of test for the determination
    of the proof and comparative tracking indices of solid insulating materials on
    pieces taken from parts of equipment and on plaques of material using alternating
    voltage. This document provides a procedure for the determination of erosion when
    required. The proof tracking index is used as an acceptance criterion as well
    as a means for the quality control of materials and fabricated parts. The comparative
    tracking index is mainly used for the basic characterization and comparison of
    the properties of materials. This test method evaluates the composition of the
    material as well as the surface of the material being evaluated. Both the composition
    and surface condition directly influence the results of the evaluation and are
    considered when using the results in material selection process. The described
    test method is designed for a test voltage up to 600 V AC, because higher test
    voltages and DC voltage will lead to a reduced test severity. Test results are
    not directly suitable for the evaluation of safe creepage distances when designing
    electrical apparatus. The results of this method have been used for insulation
    coordination of equipment. It is important that use of these results also considers
    the overvoltage levels, creepage distances, and establishes the pollution degree
    to which the product insulation system will be expected to be subjected. This
    is in compliance with IEC 60664-1. This basic safety publication focusing on a
    safety test method is primarily intended for use by technical committees in the
    preparation of safety publications in accordance with the principles laid down
    in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51. One of the responsibilities of a technical
    committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety publications in
    the preparation of its publications. This sixth edition cancels and replaces the
    fifth edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- In 7.3, the term \"resistivity\" has been
    replaced by \"conductivity\".<br />\r\nIt has the status of a basic safety publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 104.</p>"
