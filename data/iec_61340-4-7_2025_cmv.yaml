abstract:
- content: "IEC 61340-4-7:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61340-4-7:2025 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61340-4-7:2017
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 101 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61340-4-7:2025 provides test methods and procedures for evaluating
    and selecting air ionization equipment and systems (ionizers). This document establishes
    measurement techniques, under specified conditions, to determine offset voltage
    (ion balance) and decay (charge neutralization) time for ionizers. This document
    does not include measurements of electromagnetic interference (EMI), or the use
    of ionizers in connection with ordnance, flammables, explosive items or electrically
    initiated explosive devices. As contained in this document, the test methods and
    test conditions can be used by manufacturers of ionizers to provide performance
    data describing their products. Users of ionizers are urged to modify the test
    methods and test conditions for their specific application in order to qualify
    ionizers for use, or to make periodic verifications of ionizer performance. The
    user will decide the extent of the data required for each application.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) in Figure 5, a NOTE 3 was added to clarify that
    for AC bars and grids, a single emitter alternating between +/âˆ’ polarity is used;<br
    />\r\nb) in Annex B, the relative error for measurement equipment was updated
    to include the consideration for the resolution of the voltmeter."
