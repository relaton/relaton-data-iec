abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    11582:2002 defines the signalling protocol for the control of Supplementary Services
    and Additional Network Features (ANFs) at the Q reference point. The protocol
    is part of Private Signalling System no. 1 (PSS1), known informally as QSIG. The
    Q reference point exists between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges
    (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN)
    and is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. Detailed procedures applicable to individual
    supplementary services and ANFs are beyond the scope of ISO/IEC 11582:2002 and
    will be specified by other standards for those services which are standardised
    and by individual manufacturers for proprietary services using the capabilities
    defined in ISO/IEC 11582:2002.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 11572 defines the Layer 3 protocol
    for circuit-switched call control at the Q reference point. ISO/IEC 11582:2002
    defines additional protocol procedures, to be used in conjunction with those defined
    in ISO/IEC 11572 for the control of supplementary services and ANFs.<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 Typical examples of the application of these generic functional procedures to
    some supplementary services are provided in annex C, for explanatory and illustrative
    purposes only.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Specific supplementary services and Additional
    Network Features may require additional information transfer mechanisms which
    are service or feature specific and are beyond the scope of ISO/IEC 11582:2002."
