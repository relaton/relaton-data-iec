    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-12:2017 is compliant with [1]. It defines a service type referred to herein as Messaging service. </p>
    <p>The Messaging service is a UPnP service that allows control points to use the messaging features provided by a Telephony Server (TS) or a Telephony Client (TC). </p>
    <p>It provides in the UPnP network the overall set of messaging capabilities of a phone (e.g., smartphone, IP phone, VoIP gateway, etc.), as the role of a TS. Additionally, or as an alternative, a device with the role of a TC can provide the Messaging service via UPnP Telephony. </p>
    <p>This service provides the control points with the following functionalities:</p>
    <p>-           Page Mode Messaging (e.g., e-Mail, SMS, MMS, etc.): notification of incoming messages, reading messages, sending a message, deleting a message.</p>
    <p>-           Session Mode Messaging (e.g., Instant Messaging, SMS, etc.): notification of incoming messages, retrieving and sending the messages within a session, creating, modifying or closing a messaging session.</p>
    <p>-           File transfer session, to transfer the files in near real time.</p>
    <p>This service does not provide the following functionalities:</p>
    <p>-           Connection to a remote server for sending or receiving the messages (e.g., WAN side);</p>
    <p>-           Rendering of message notifications and messages to the end user;</p>
    <p>-           Configuring the Messaging service with account for connecting to remote servers;</p>
