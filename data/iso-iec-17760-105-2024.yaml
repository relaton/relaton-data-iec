    <p>The set of AT Attachment standards consists of this standard and the ATA implementation standards described in AT Attachment - 8 ATA/ATAPI Architecture Model (ATA8-AAM). This standard specifies the command set that host systems use to access storage devices. This standard provides a common command set for systems manufacturers, system integrators, software suppliers, and suppliers of intelligent storage devices. Figure 1 shows the relationship of this standard to other ATA standards as well as related device and host standards and specifications (e.g., SCSI standards and SATA-IO specifications).</p>
    <p>This standard maintains compatibility with the ACS-4 standard, INCITS 529-2018, while providing additional functions.</p>
