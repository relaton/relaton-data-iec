abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15459-6:2007 specifies a unique, non-significant string of characters
    for the unique identifier of product groupings. The character string is intended
    to be represented in linear bar code and two-dimensional symbols, radio frequency
    identification (RFID) transponder or other automatic identification and data capture
    (AIDC) media attached to the product and/or material to meet the management needs
    in a batch or lot unit. To address management needs, different classes of item
    are recognised in the various parts of ISO/IEC 15459. This allows different requirements
    to be met by the unique identifiers of each class.The unique identifier for product
    grouping enables a product grouping defined by a batch or lot number to be uniquely
    identified from all other lots and batches compliant with ISO/IEC 15459-6:2007.
    Encoding this unique identifier in a data carrier enables information about the
    quality of product and end-of-life processing to be clearly identified.The rules
    for the unique identifier for product grouping, to identify the unique occurrence
    of that quality, are defined and supported by an example.
