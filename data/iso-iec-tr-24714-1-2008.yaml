    <p>ISO/IEC TR 24714-1:2008 gives guidelines for the stages in the life cycle of a system's biometric and associated elements. This covers the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the capture and design of initial requirements, including legal frameworks;</li>
    <li>development and deployment;</li>
    <li>operations, including enrolment and subsequent usage;</li>
    <li>interrelationships with other systems;</li>
    <li>related data storage and security of data;</li>
    <li>data updates and maintenance;</li>
    <li>training and awareness;</li>
    <li>system evaluation and audit;</li>
    <li>controlled system expiration.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The areas addressed are limited to the design and implementation of biometric technologies with respect to the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>legal and societal constraints on the use of biometric data;</li>
    <li>accessibility for the widest population;</li>
    <li>health and safety, addressing the concerns of users regarding direct potential hazards as well as the possibility of the misuse of inferred data from biometric information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The intended audiences for ISO/IEC TR 24714-1:2008 are planners, implementers and system operators of biometric systems.</p>
