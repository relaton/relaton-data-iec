- content: |-
    applies to passive filter units for electromagnetic interference suppression which fall within the scope of the Generic Specification IEC 60939-1.
    The scope of this Sectional specification is restricted to passive filter units for which safety tests are appropriate. This implies that filters specified according to this Sectional specification will either be connected to mains supplies, when compliance with the mandatory tests of Table 3 is necessary, or used in other circuit positions where the equipment specification prescribes that some or all of these safety tests are required.

    The contents of the corrigendum of November 2005 have been included in this copy.
