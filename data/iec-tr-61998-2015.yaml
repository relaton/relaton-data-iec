  content: "IEC TR 61998:2015(E) provides models and frameworks for the standardization
    of multimedia technology, being undertaken or to be undertaken by IEC as the result
    of the IEC PACT report. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 1999 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- the annexes describing various technologies have been deleted because
    their roles have ceased over the past two decades;<br />\r\n- TC 100 frameworks
    are described in more general form and from the viewpoint of the model of data
    usage and communication including the possible future technologies of TC 100."
