abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    document defines the LTFS Format requirements for interchanged media that claims
    LTFS compliance. Those requirements are specified as the size and sequence of
    data blocks and file marks on the media, the content and form of special data
    constructs (the LTFS Label and LTFS Index), and the content of the partition labels
    and use of MAM parameters.<br />\r\nThe data content (not the physical media)
    of the LTFS format shall be interchangeable among all data storage systems claiming
    conformance to this format. Physical media interchange is dependent on compatibility
    of physical media and the media access devices in use.<br />\r\nNOTE: This document
    does not contain instructions or tape command sequences to build the LTFS structure."
