abstract:
- content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document defines the LTFS
    Format requirements for interchanged media that claims LTFS compliance. Those
    requirements are specified as the size and sequence of data blocks and file marks
    on the media, the content and form of special data constructs (the LTFS Label
    and LTFS Index), and the content of the partition labels and use of MAM parameters.</p><p>The
    data content (not the physical media) of the LTFS format shall be interchangeable
    among all data storage systems claiming conformance to this format. Physical media
    interchange is dependent on compatibility of physical media and the media access
    devices in use.</p><p>NOTE: This document does not contain instructions or tape
    command sequences to build the LTFS structure.</p>'
