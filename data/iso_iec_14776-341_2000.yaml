abstract:
- content: The SCSI command set is designed to provide efficient peer-to-peer operation
    of input&#x2F;output devices (disks, tapes, printers, etc.) by an operating system.
    The SCSI command set assumes a command-response protocol. Action on SCSI commands
    shall not be deemed completed until a response is received. The response shall
    include a status that indicates the final disposition of the command. The SCSI
    command set provides multiple operating systems concurrent control over one or
    more input&#x2F;output devices. However, the multiple operating systems must properly
    coordinate their actions or data corruption will result. This standard defines
    commands that assist with coordination between multiple operating systems. This
    standard defines a device model for SCSI-3 storage arrays, the commands that may
    apply to SCSI-3 storage arrays, and the SCSI commands that are uniquely for SCSI-3
    storage arrays.
