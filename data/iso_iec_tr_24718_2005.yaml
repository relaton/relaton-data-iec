abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 24718:2005 gives a complete description of the motivations behind the Ada Ravenscar
    Profile, to show how conformant programs can be analysed and to give examples
    of usage. The profile is a subset of the Ada tasking model, restricted to meet
    the real-time community requirements for determinism, schedulability analysis
    and memory-boundedness, as well as being suitable for mapping to a small and efficient
    run-time system that supports task synchronization and communication, and which
    could be certifiable to the highest integrity levels. The profile has been designed
    such that the restricted form of tasking that it defines can be used even for
    software that needs to be verified to the very highest integrity levels."
