abstract:
- content: "The purpose of this technical specification is to establish standard methods
    for a qualitative check of the performance of ultrasound physiotherapy devices
    during their lifetime, and to provide guidance on calibration requirements and
    techniques.\n\nTo ensure that the ultrasound physiotherapy equipment is in an
    appropriate condition for use, a regular quality check is necessary. This technical
    specification defines acceptance, weekly and annual checks. The acceptance test
    checks the delivery of the device and its performance at the start of its lifetime.
    The weekly check is a simple qualitative check of device operation. In the annual
    check, in addition to a qualitative check, a quantitative check is defined. Examples
    are provided of weekly and annual test reports. \n\nThis report also gives guidance
    to the testers concerning the measurement of acoustic output. \n\nAnnual testing
    is to be performed by a skilled tester, e.g. biomedical engineer, medical physicist,
    medical device service agent, commercial tester, test house, national measurement
    institute or manufacturer."
