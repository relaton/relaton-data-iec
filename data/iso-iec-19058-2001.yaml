    <p>This International Standard specifies the functional protocol for the support of supplementary services and additional basic call</p>
    <p>capabilities at the Q-reference point. The Q-reference point exists between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges</p>
    <p>(PINX) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN) and is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. The</p>
    <p>generic functional protocol is part of the B-QSIG signalling system.</p>
    <p>The procedures specified in this International Standard can be used in association with a bearer connection (bearer-related) or</p>
    <p>outside the context of any bearer connection (bearer-independent).The application of this International Standard to individual</p>
    <p>additional basic call capabilities and supplementary services is outside the scope of this International Standard and should be</p>
    <p>defined in those standards or proprietary specifications that specify the individual capabilities.</p>
    <p>All conformance to this International Standard is based on the external behaviour at the interface at the Q-reference point, i.e.</p>
    <p>on the generation of the correct message structure and in the proper sequence as specified in this International Standard.</p>
    <p>The generic functional protocol is based on ATM Forum specification AF-CS-0102.000, which itself is based on the DSS2</p>
    <p>generic functional protocol specified in ITU-T Rec. Q.2932.1 but extended to allow non-local information exchange as well as</p>
    <p>local information exchange.</p>
    <p>This International Standard is applicable to PINXs supporting additional basic call capabilities and/or supplementary services</p>
    <p>requiring the functional protocol for signalling at the Q-reference point.</p>
