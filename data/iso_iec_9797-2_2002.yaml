abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 9797-2:2002 specifies three MAC algorithms that use a secret key
    and a hash-function (or its round-function) with an n-bit result to calculate
    an m-bit MAC. These mechanisms can be used as data integrity mechanisms to verify
    that data has not been altered in an unauthorised manner. They can also be used
    as message authentication mechanisms to provide assurance that a message has been
    originated by an entity in possession of the secret key. The strength of the data
    integrity mechanism and message authentication mechanism is dependent on the length
    (in bits) k and secrecy of the key, on the length (in bits) n of a hash-code produced
    by the hash-function, on the strength of the hash-function, on the length (in
    bits) m of the MAC, and on the specific mechanism.The three mechanisms specified
    in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2002 are based on the dedicated hash-functions specified in
    ISO/IEC 10118-3. The first mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2002 is commonly
    known as MDx-MAC. It calls the complete hash-function once, but it makes a small
    modification to the round-function by adding a key to the additive constants in
    the round-function. The second mechanism specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2002 is commonly
    known as HMAC. It calls the complete hash-function twice. The third mechanism
    specified in ISO/IEC 9797-2:2002 is a variant of MDx-MAC that takes as input only
    short strings (at most 256 bits). It offers a higher performance for applications
    that work with short input strings only.ISO/IEC 9797-2:2002 can be applied to
    the security services of any security architecture, process, or application.
