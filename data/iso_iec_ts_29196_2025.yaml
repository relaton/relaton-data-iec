abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoBodyText">This document gives guidance relating to successful,
    secure and usable implementation of biometric enrolment processes, while indicating
    risk factors that organizations which use biometric technologies can address during
    procurement, design, deployment and operation. Much of this document is generic
    to many types of applications, e.g. from national scale commercial and government
    applications, to closed systems for in-house operations, and to consumer applications.
    However, the intended application and its purpose often have influence on the
    necessary enrolment data quality and are taken into account when specifying an
    enrolment system and process.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies
    the differences in operation relating to specific types of application, e.g. where
    self-enrolment is more appropriate than attended enrolment. This document focuses
    on mandatory, attended enrolment at fixed locations. It ultimately consolidates
    information relating to better practices for the implementation of biometric enrolment
    capability in various business contexts including considerations of process, function
    (system), and technology, as well as legal/privacy and policy aspects.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document provides guidance on collection and storage of biometric enrolment data
    and the impact on dependent processes of verification and identification. This
    document does not include material specific to forensic and law enforcement applications.</p>
