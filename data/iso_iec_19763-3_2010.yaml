abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19763 specifies a metamodel framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC
    19763-3:2010 specifies a metamodel that provides a facility to register administrative
    and evolution information related to ontologies, independent of the languages
    in which they are expressed. The metamodel also administers the authoritative
    extent of ontologies, which indicates how commonly they can be used.A registry
    that conforms to ISO/IEC 19763-3:2010, together with repositories that contain
    actual ontologies, makes it possible for users to gain the benefits of interoperation
    among application systems based on ontologies.
