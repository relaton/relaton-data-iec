abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24741:2018 describes the history of biometrics and what
    biometrics does, the various biometric technologies in general use today (for
    example, fingerprint recognition and face recognition) and the architecture of
    the systems and the system processes that allow automated recognition using those
    technologies. It also provides information about the application of biometrics
    in various business domains such as border management, law enforcement and driver
    licensing, the societal and jurisdiction considerations that are typically taken
    into account in biometric systems, and the international standards that underpin
    their use.</p>"
