abstract:
- content: "IEC 61010-2-011:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61010-2-011:2019 specifies
    particular safety requirements for the following types a) to c) of electrical
    equipment and their accessories, wherever they are intended to be used, whenever
    that equipment incorporates refrigerating systems as an integral part of, or separate
    from, the equipment and the equipment is in direct control of the refrigerating
    system. This document details all the requirements when up to 150 g of flammable
    refrigerant are used per stage of a refrigerating system. Additional requirements
    beyond the current scope of this document apply if a refrigerant charge of flammable
    refrigerant exceeds this amount.<br />\r\na) Electrical test and measurement equipment<br
    />\r\nThis is equipment which by electromagnetic means tests, measures, indicates
    or records one or more electrical or physical quantities, also non-measuring equipment
    such as signal generators, measurement standards, power supplies for laboratory
    use, transducers, transmitters, etc.<br />\r\nb) Electrical industrial process-control
    equipment<br />\r\nThis is equipment which controls one or more output quantities
    to specific values, with each value determined by manual setting, by local or
    remote programming, or by one or more input variables.<br />\r\nc) Electrical
    laboratory equipment<br />\r\nThis is equipment which measures, indicates, monitors,
    inspects or analyses materials, or is used to prepare materials, and includes
    in vitro diagnostic (IVD) equipment. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with changes introduced by Amendment
    1 of IEC 61010-1:2010;<br />\r\nb) introduction of new defined terms or modified
    terms to align with Part 2-012 and other source documents. Editorial changes to
    use small capitals only for defined terms. Note the difference of defined term
    in 4.3.2.101 and abnormal operation in 11.7.104.3 and 11.7.104.5;<br />\r\nc)
    clarifications for cooling tests in 4.4.2.10;<br />\r\nd) changes pertaining to
    the accurate employment of the following terms: temperature, operating temperature,
    application temperature, controlled temperature, room ambient and ambient temperature;<br
    />\r\ne) use of defined term to replace cooling system;<br />\r\nf) move text
    of 4.4.2.101 to 4.3.2.101, since the purpose of as defined, is to simulate failure
    of the ambient conditions of 1.4.1 but not of the of the equipment;<br />\r\ng)
    use of the term equipment to replace unit, apparatus, appliance, where applicable;<br
    />\r\nh) in 5.1.2 dd) for high and low sides for each stage are required only
    under;<br />\r\ni) use of defined term to replace normal operation;<br />\r\nj)
    use of defined term to replace user.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety
    publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104.</p>"
