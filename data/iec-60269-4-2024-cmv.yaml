    CSV edition 5.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 32B experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60269-4:2024 applies with the following supplementary
    requirements. Fuse-links for the protection of semiconductor devices shall comply
    with aIl requirements of IEC 60269-1, if not otherwise indicated hereinafter,
    and shall also comply with the supplementary requirements laid down below. These
    supplementary requirements apply to fuse-links for application in equipment containing
    semiconductor devices for circuits of nominal voltages up to 1 000 V AC or 1 500
    V DC. For some fuse‑links higher rated voltages can be used."
