abstract:
- content: "IEC 62705:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62705:2022
    gives requirements for the lifecycle management of radiation monitoring systems
    (RMS) and gives guidance on the application of existing IEC standards covering
    the design and qualification of systems and equipment. The purpose of this document
    is to lay down requirements for the lifecycle management of RMSs and give application
    guidance. This document is intended to be consistent with the latest versions
    of International Standards dealing with radiation monitors, sampling of radioactive
    materials, instruments calibration, hardware and software design, classification,
    and qualification. This document is applicable to RMSs installed in nuclear facilities
    intended for use during normal operation, anticipated operational occurrences
    (AOO), design basis accidents (DBA) and design extension conditions (DEC), including
    severe accidents (SA). This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2014. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- modification of the title.<br
    />\r\n- to be consistent with the categorization of the accident condition.<br
    />\r\n- to update the references to new standards published since the first edition.<br
    />\r\n- to update the terms and definitions."
