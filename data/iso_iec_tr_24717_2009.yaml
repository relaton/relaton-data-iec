abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 24717:2009 specifies the interfaces and behaviour of a common
    class library for managing sets of object references in COBOL. The purpose of
    ISO/IEC TR 24717:2009 is to promote a high degree of portability in implementations
    of the class library, even though some elements are subject to trial before completion
    of a final design suitable for standardization.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 24717:2009
    builds on the syntax and semantics defined in ISO/IEC 1989:2002."
