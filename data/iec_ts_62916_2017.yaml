abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62916:2017(E) describes a discrete component bypass diode electrostatic
    discharge (ESD) immunity test and data analysis method. The test method described
    subjects a bypass diode to a progressive ESD stress test and the analysis method
    provides a means for analyzing and extrapolating the resulting failures using
    the two-parameter Weibull distribution function. It is the object of this document
    to establish a common and reproducible test method for determining diode surge
    voltage tolerance consistent with an ESD event during the manufacturing, packaging,
    transportation or installation processes of PV modules.
