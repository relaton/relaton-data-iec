abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-12:2025 specifies cables intended to be used for single balanced
    pair cabling for office, home and industrial application described in ISO/IEC
    11801-1:2017 and ISO/IEC 11801:2017/AMD1. An example of existing application is
    1000BASE-T1, see ISO/IEC TR 11801 9906. The transmission characteristics of these
    cables are specified up to a frequency of 1,25 GHz and at a temperature of 20
    Â°C. The T1-B type cable is specified from 0,1 MHz to 600 MHz, the T1 C type cable
    from 0,1 MHz to 1,25 GHz. Depending on the MICE environment and the installation
    conditions, either unscreened or screened cables can be used. A blank detail specification
    can be found in Annex A. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) additional cable type in support of T1-C generic
    single pair cabling up to 1,25 GHz;<br />\r\nb) introduction of low frequency
    coupling attenuation as an integral parameter describing screening efficiency
    at frequencies below 30 MHz."
