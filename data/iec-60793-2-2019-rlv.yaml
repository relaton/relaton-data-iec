  content: "IEC 60793-2:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60793-2:2019
    contains the general specifications for both multimode and single-mode optical
    fibres. Sectional specifications for each of the four categories of multimode
    fibres: A1, A2, A3, and A4 (part of the multimode fibre class A) contain requirements
    specific to each category. Sectional specifications for each of the three single-mode
    fibre classes, B, C and D contain requirements common to each class. Each sectional
    specification includes family specifications (in normative annexes) that contain
    requirements for the applicable category or sub-categories. These sub-categories
    are distinguished on the basis of different fibre types or applications. The requirements
    of this document apply to all classes. Each sectional specification contains the
    requirements that are common to all the family specifications that are within
    it. These common requirements are copied to the family specification for ease
    of reference. Tests or measurement methods are defined for each specified attribute.
    Where possible, these definitions are by reference to an IEC International Standard
    (see IEC 60793-1 series) – otherwise the test or measurement method is outlined
    in the relevant sectional specification. This ninth edition cancels and replaces
    the eighth edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- introduction of the revised fibre designations
    for most A1 sub-category fibres and all class B single-mode fibres;<br />\r\n-
    addition of the new fibre model (A1-OM5) defined for A1 category;<br />\r\n- addition
    of class D polarization maintaining fibres.<br />\r\nKeywords: specifications
    for both multimode and single-mode optical fibres"
