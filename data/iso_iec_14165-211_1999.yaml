abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165 defines the frame format and protocol definitions
    required to transfer information for upper-layer protocols that use the High-Performance
    Parallel Interface Framing Protocol (HIPPI-FP) when using a lower-layer serial
    link interface operating according to the Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling
    Interface (FC-PH) and Fibre Channel Enhanced Physical (FC-EP) requirements. For
    example, the HIPPI upper-layer protocols would use FC-FP when the underlying physical
    layer is Fibre Channel, and would use HIPPI-FP when the underlying physical layer
    is HIPPI.
