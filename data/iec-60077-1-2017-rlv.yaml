    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60077-1:2017
    specifies the general service conditions and requirements for all electric equipment
    installed in power circuits, auxiliary circuits, control and indicating circuits
    etc., on railway rolling stock. The purpose of this document is to harmonize as
    far as practicable all rules and requirements of a general nature applicable to
    electric equipment for rolling stock. This new edition includes the following
    main technical changes with regard to the previous edition: descriptions regarding
    insulation coordination, environmental conditions and those of current return
    and protective bonding are deleted and replaced by references to IEC 62497‑1,
    IEC 62498-1 and IEC 61991; classification of equipment type is introduced; temperature
    limits and temperature rise tests are reviewed."
