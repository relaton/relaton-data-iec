    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60068-2-5:2018 specifies
    the methods for testing equipment or components under simulated solar radiation
    conditions. This document is applicable to the equipment and components at the
    surface of the earth. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    of published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- the title of this document has been modified;<br />\r\n- the
    current thermal effect test method, specified as \"Test method Sa\" has been retained
    and the weathering test method specified as \"Test method Sb\" has been added.</p>"
