    <p>ISO/IEC 26559:2017, within the context of the tools and methods of variability traceability for software and system product lines<b>:</b></p>
    <p>-      provides the terms and definitions specific to variability traceability for software and systems product lines;</p>
    <p>-      defines process groups and their processes for establishing and managing variability traceability at product line lifecycle processes. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes;</p>
    <p>-      defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;</p>
    <p>-      defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 26559:2017 does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products.</p>
