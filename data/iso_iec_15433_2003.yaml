abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15433:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Wireless Terminal Authentication supplementary services (SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN)
    at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges
    (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>Authentication
    of a WTM user (SS-WTAT) is a supplementary service that enables a PISN, as a security
    measure, to validate the identity provided by the WTM user.</p><p>Authentication
    of the PISN (SS-WTAN) is a supplementary service that enables a served WTM user,
    as a security measure, to validate the identity of the PISN.</p><p>The mechanisms
    used in these services are based on the challenge and response method of authentication.</p><p>Authentication
    algorithms to be used by these supplementary services are outside the scope of
    this International Standard.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three stages and according
    to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This International Standard contains
    the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements
    identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15432.</p><p>The
    signalling protocol for SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN uses certain aspects of the generic
    procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    15433:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the
    support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-WTAT / SS-WTAN and
    other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15433:2003 is applicable
    to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
