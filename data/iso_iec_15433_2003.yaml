abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15433:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Wireless Terminal
    Authentication supplementary services (SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected
    together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nAuthentication
    of a WTM user (SS-WTAT) is a supplementary service that enables a PISN, as a security
    measure, to validate the identity provided by the WTM user.<br />\r\nAuthentication
    of the PISN (SS-WTAN) is a supplementary service that enables a served WTM user,
    as a security measure, to validate the identity of the PISN.<br />\r\nThe mechanisms
    used in these services are based on the challenge and response method of authentication.<br
    />\r\nAuthentication algorithms to be used by these supplementary services are
    outside the scope of this International Standard.<br />\r\nThe Q reference point
    is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications are produced in
    three stages and according to the method specified in ITU-T Rec. I.130. This International
    Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies
    the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC
    15432.<br />\r\nThe signalling protocol for SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN uses certain aspects
    of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15433:2003 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between SS-WTAT / SS-WTAN and other supplementary services and ANFs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15433:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN."
