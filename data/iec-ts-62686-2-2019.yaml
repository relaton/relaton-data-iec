  content: "IEC TS 62686-2:2019 defines the minimum requirements for general purpose
    \"off-the-shelf\" COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) passive components for aerospace,
    defence and high performance (ADHP) applications. This document applies to all
    passive components that can be operated in ADHP applications within the manufacturers’
    publicly available data sheet limits in conjunction with IEC TS 62239-1. This
    document can be used by other high performance and high reliability industries,
    at their discretion.<br />\r\nADHP application requirements are not necessarily
    fulfilled by this document alone. ADHP original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)
    could consider redesigning their products or conducting further testing to verify
    suitability in ADHP applications using their procedures for satisfying their electronic
    component management plan (ECMP) (see IEC TS 62239-1).<br />\r\nThis first edition
    cancels and replaces IEC PAS 62686-2 published in 2016."
