abstract:
- content: "IEC 63241-3-3:2025 applies to transportable planers and thicknessers intended
    to plane wood.<br />\r\nThis document is to be used in conjunction with the first
    edition of IEC 63241-1:2023.<br />\r\nThis document supplements or modifies the
    corresponding clauses in IEC 63241-1, so as to convert it into the IEC Standard:
    Particular requirements for transportable planers and thicknessers.<br />\r\nWhere
    a particular subclause of IEC 63241-1 is not mentioned in this document, that
    subclause applies as far as reasonable. Where this document states \"addition\",
    \"modification\" or \"replacement\", the relevant text in IEC 63241-1 is to be
    adapted accordingly.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒThe attention of National Committees is drawn
    to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations can need a
    transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication
    in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip
    themselves for conducting new or revised tests.<br />\r\nIt is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication."
