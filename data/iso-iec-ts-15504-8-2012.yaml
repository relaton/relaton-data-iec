    <p>ISO/IEC TS 15504-8:2012 provides an example of an IT Service Management Process Assessment Model (PAM) for use in performing a conformance assessment in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2. It enables implemented processes of ISO/IEC 20000-1 to be assessed according to the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2.</p>
    <p>An integral part of conducting an assessment is to use a PAM that is constructed for that purpose. A PAM is related to a Process Reference Model (PRM) and is conformant with ISO/IEC 15504-2.</p>
