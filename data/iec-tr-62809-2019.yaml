  content: IEC TR 62809:2019 provides an overview of the requirements and tests of
    IEC 60601-2-66 in combination with the applicable sections of IEC 60601-1, and
    the collateral standards of the IEC 60601 series. It is intended to assist various
    groups involved in the product lifecycles process - like designers and suppliers
    - to get an overview of the basic requirements without studying all involved standard
    documents in detail. The table includes not all but just the more common requirements
    and tests. It is crucial to understand that the summary in this document cannot
    serve as an input for a product requirement specification or as a test plan without
    consulting IEC 60601-2-66 itself. This document alone cannot be used to establish
    or assess compliance to IEC 60601-2-66.
