  content: IEC TR 62351-12:2016(E) discusses cyber security recommendations and engineering/operational
    strategies for improving the resilience of power systems with interconnected Distributed
    Energy Resources (DER) systems. It covers the resilience requirements for the
    many different stakeholders of these dispersed cyber-physical generation and storage
    devices, with the goal of enhancing the safety, reliability, power quality, and
    other operational aspects of power systems, particularly those with high penetrations
    of DER systems. It addresses the resilience issues for cyber-physical DER systems
    interconnected with the power grid, building on the concepts and the hierarchical
    architecture described in the Smart Grid Interoperability Panel (SGIP) draft DRGS
    Subgroup B White Paper - Categorizing Use Cases in Hierarchical DER Systems.
