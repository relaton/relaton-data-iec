abstract:
- content: "IEC 63378-2-1:2024 specifies three-dimensional (3D) thermal models of
    discrete semiconductor packages (TO-243, TO-252 and TO-263), utilized in the steady-state
    thermal analysis of electronic devices to estimate junction temperatures accurately.<br
    />\r\nThis model is assumed to be made by semiconductor suppliers and to be used
    by assembly makers of electronic devices."
