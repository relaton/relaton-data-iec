    61000-2-5:2017(E) is a Technical Report intended for guidance for those who are
    in charge of considering and developing immunity requirements. It also gives basic
    guidance for the selection of immunity levels. The data are applicable to any

    in one of the locations as considered in this document.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; This
    Technical Report provides the following:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; – introduces the concept
    of disturbance degrees and defines these for each electromagnetic phenomena;&lt;br
    &#x2F;&gt; – classifies into various location classes and describes them by means
    of attributes;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; – provides background information on the different
    electromagnetic phenomena that may exist within the environment and;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;
    – compiles tables of compatibility levels for electromagnetic phenomena that are
    considered to be relevant for those location classes.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second published in 2011. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; a) the description
    of the radiated electromagnetic environment has been updated taking into account
    recent communication technologies;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt; b) some conducted phenomena
