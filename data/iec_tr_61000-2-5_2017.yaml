abstract:
- content: "IEC/TR 61000-2-5:2017(E) is a Technical Report intended for guidance for
    those who are in charge of considering and developing immunity requirements. It
    also gives basic guidance for the selection of immunity levels. The data are applicable
    to any item of electrical or electronic equipment, sub-system or system that operates
    in one of the locations as considered in this document.<br />\r\nThis Technical
    Report provides the following:<br />\r\n– introduces the concept of disturbance
    degrees and defines these for each electromagnetic phenomena;<br />\r\n– classifies
    into various location classes and describes them by means of attributes;<br />\r\n–
    provides background information on the different electromagnetic phenomena that
    may exist within the environment and;<br />\r\n– compiles tables of compatibility
    levels for electromagnetic phenomena that are considered to be relevant for those
    location classes.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second
    published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) the description of the radiated electromagnetic environment
    has been updated taking into account recent communication technologies;<br />\r\nb)
    some conducted phenomena and respective interference sources have been described
    in more detail."
