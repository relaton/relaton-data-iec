abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25040:2011 contains requirements and recommendations for the
    evaluation of software product quality and clarifies the general concepts. It
    provides a process description for evaluating software product quality and states
    the requirements for the application of this process. The evaluation process can
    be used for different purposes and approaches. The process can be used for the
    evaluation of the quality of pre-developed software, commercial-off-the-shelf
    software or custom software and can be used during or after the development process.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    25040:2011 establishes the relationship of the evaluation reference model to the
    SQuaRE documents as well as shows how each SQuaRE document should be used during
    the activities of the evaluation process.</p><p>It is intended for those responsible
    for software product evaluation and is appropriate for developers, acquirers and
    independent evaluators of software products. These three different approaches
    are detailed in ISO/IEC 14598-3, ISO/IEC 14598-4, and ISO/IEC 14598-5.</p><p>It
    is not intended for evaluation of other aspects of software products (such as
    functional requirements, process requirements, business requirements, etc.).</p>"
