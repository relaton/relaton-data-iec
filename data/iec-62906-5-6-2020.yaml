  content: IEC 62906-5-6:2020 (E) specifies the standard measurement conditions and
    measuring methods for determining the optical performance of a projection screen
    in terms of its photometric characteristics, including screen gain and speckle
    contrast, from different viewing directions. These methods are only applied for
    the case in which the projection screen and a laser projector are integrated and
    used with a fixed configuration as a set to create a real image. Both front and
    rear projection screens, with a flat surface, are included. This document excludes
    projection screens which are classified as optically see-through screens, including
    head-up displays.
