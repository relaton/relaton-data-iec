  content: "IEC TR 61282-15:2017 provides guidance for the testing of multi-fibre
    cable, multimode or single-mode, terminated with plugs described in IEC 61754­7
    (all parts) (multiple-fibre push on – MPO). Guidance is provided on the measurement
    of attenuation, polarity, length and optical return loss. The cabling can be installed
    in a variety of environments, including residential, commercial, industrial, and
    data centre premises, and possibly in outside plant environments.<br />\r\nKeywords:
    attenuation, polarity, length and optical return loss, MPO connectors, multi-fibre
    cable"
