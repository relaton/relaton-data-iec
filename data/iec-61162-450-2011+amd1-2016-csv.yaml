  content: IEC 61162-450:2011+A1:2016(E) specifies interface requirements and methods
    of test for high speed communication between shipboard navigation and radiocommunication
    equipment as well as between such systems and other ship systems that need to
    communicate with navigation and radio-communication equipment. Is based on the
    application of an appropriate suite of existing international standards to provide
    a framework for implementing data transfer between devices on a shipboard Ethernet
    network. Provides a higher speed and higher capacity alternative to the IEC 61162-1
    and IEC 61162-2 standards while retaining these standards' basic data format.
    Provides a higher data capacity than IEC 61162-3. Specifies an Ethernet based
    bus type network where any listener may receive messages from any sender. <strong>This
    consolidated version consists of the first edition (2011) and its amendment 1
    (2016). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.</strong>
