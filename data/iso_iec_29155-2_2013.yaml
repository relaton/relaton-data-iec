abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 provides general requirements for processes of
    "the information technology (IT) project performance benchmarking framework" by
    prescribing:</p><ul><li>the requirements for the processes for individual activities
    within the benchmarking framework (e.g. conduct benchmarking, maintain repository,
    submit data),</li><li>the tasks necessary to successfully execute activities and
    equip them with components, both of which are defined in ISO/IEC 29155-1.</li><li>ISO/IEC
    29155-2:2013 is intended for use by any stakeholder(s) of IT project performance
    benchmarking (e.g. benchmarking user, benchmark provider, benchmarking service
    provider, and IT project team).</li></ul><p>The following are examples of how
    ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 can be used:</p><ul><li>by a systems and software supplier
    to implement a benchmarking process to estimate and/or evaluate performance of
    an IT project,</li><li>by a systems and software acquirer (or a third-party agent)
    for evaluating the performance of the supplier's IT project,</li><li>by a benchmark
    provider to implement processes to collect and analyse IT project data and provide
    benchmarks,</li><li>by a benchmarking service provider to implement various services
    (e.g. providing instruments for benchmarking, or conducting an instance of benchmarking
    for a benchmarking user).</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 does not prescribe
    how to utilize benchmarking results, nor does it prescribe the name, format, or
    explicit content of the documentation that results from the benchmarking processes.</p>
