abstract:
- content: IEC 62595-2-4:2020(E) specifies the electro-optical measuring methods of
    laser modules with multiple laser devices and an optical output for various displays
    and display lighting applications which require photometric and colorimetric measurements,
    covering the wavelength range of 380 nm to 780 nm. The module has multiple laser
    devices such as edge-emitting laser diodes (LDs), vertical cavity surface-emitting
    laser diodes (VCSELs), or photon up-conversion laser devices including second-harmonic
    generation (SHG). The module has an optical output such as an optical fibre, waveguide,
    light guide, lens unit, or other optics, emitting a laser beam combining the output
    of the multiple laser devices.
