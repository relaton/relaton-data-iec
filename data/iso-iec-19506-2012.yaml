  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19506:2012 defines a meta-model for representing existing software
    assets, their associations, and operational environments, referred to as the Knowledge
    Discovery Meta-model (KDM). This is the first in the series of specifications
    related to Software Assurance (SwA) and Architecture-Driven Modernization (ADM)
    activities. KDM facilitates projects that involve existing software systems by
    insuring interoperability and exchange of data between tools provided by different
    vendors.</p>"
