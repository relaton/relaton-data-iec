  content: IEC/TR 61292-4:2010(E) applies to all commercially available optical amplifiers
    (OAs), including optical fibre amplifiers (OFAs) using active fibres, as well
    as Raman amplifiers. Semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) using semiconductor
    gain media are also included. This technical report provides a simple informative
    guideline on the threshold of high optical power that causes high-temperature
    damage of fibre. Also discussed is optical safety for manufacturers and users
    of optical amplifiers by reiterating substantial parts of existing standards and
    agreements on eye and skin safety. This edition constitutes a technical revision
    with updates reflecting new research in the subject area.
