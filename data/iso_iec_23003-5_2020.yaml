    family of standards based on the ISO base media file format. This includes mono,
    stereo and multi-channel audio in Linear Pulse Code Modulation (LPCM) format with
    various word lengths and sampling rates, and also floating point format. Such
    representations also occur in other container formats, such as RIFF WAV or AIFF.
