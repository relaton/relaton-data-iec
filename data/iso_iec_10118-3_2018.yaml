abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies dedicated hash-functions, i.e. specially designed
    hash-functions. The hash-functions in this document are based on the iterative
    use of a round-function. Distinct round-functions are specified, giving rise to
    distinct dedicated hash-functions.</p><p>The use of Dedicated Hash-Functions 1,
    2 and 3 in new digital signature implementations is deprecated.</p><p>NOTE As
    a result of their short hash-code length and/or cryptanalytic results, Dedicated
    Hash-Functions 1, 2 and 3 do not provide a sufficient level of collision resistance
    for future digital signature applications and they are therefore, only usable
    for legacy applications. However, for applications where collision resistance
    is not required, such as in hash-functions as specified in ISO/IEC 9797‑2, or
    in key derivation functions specified in ISO/IEC 11770‑6, their use is not deprecated.</p><p>Numerical
    examples for dedicated hash-functions specified in this document are given in
    Annex B as additional information. For information purposes, SHA-3 extendable-output
    functions are specified in Annex C.</p>"
