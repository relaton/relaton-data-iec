abstract:
- content: "This document:<br />\r\n- defines a process assessment model that relies
    on the process reference model published as ISO/IEC TS 33054 that meets the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 33004 and that supports the performance of an assessment by providing
    indicators for guidance on the interpretation of the process purposes and outcomes
    and the process attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 33020;<br />\r\n- provides guidance,
    by example, on the definition, selection and use of assessment indicators.<br
    />\r\nA process assessment model comprises a set of indicators of process performance
    and process capability. The indicators are used as a basis for collecting the
    objective evidence that enables an assessor to assign ratings. The set of indicators
    included in this document is not intended to be an all-inclusive set.<br />\r\nThe
    process assessment model in this document is directed at assessment sponsors and
    competent assessors who wish to select a model, and associated documented process
    method, for assessment (for either capability determination or process improvement).
    Additionally, it can be of use to developers of assessment models in the construction
    of their own model, by providing examples of good service management practices.
    It can be used by:<br />\r\na) service providers to assess and improve a service
    management system (SMS);<br />\r\nb) service providers to demonstrate their capability
    for the planning, design, development, transition and delivery of services that
    meet agreed service management requirements.<br />\r\nAny process assessment model
    meeting the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 33004 concerning models for process
    assessment can be used for assessment. Different models and methods can be needed
    to address differing business needs. The assessment model in ISO/IEC TS 33074
    is provided as an assessment model meeting all the requirements expressed in ISO/IEC
    33004."
