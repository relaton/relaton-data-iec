abstract:
- content: "IEC 60749-5:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60749-5:2023
    provides a steady-state temperature and humidity bias life test to evaluate the
    reliability of non-hermetic packaged semiconductor devices in humid environments.
    This test method is considered destructive. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    The specification of the test equipment is changed to require the need to minimize
    relative humidity gradients and maximize air flow between semiconductor devices
    under test;<br />\r\nb) The specification of the test equipment fixtures is changed
    to require the avoidance of condensation on devices under test and on electrical
    fixtures connecting the devices to the test equipment;<br />\r\nc) replacement
    of references to “virtual junction” with “die”."
