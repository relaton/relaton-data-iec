abstract:
- content: Describes test cases for conformance testing of telecontrol equipment,
    substation automation systems and telecontrol systems, including front-end functions
    of SCADA. Will facilitate interoperability by providing a standard method of testing
    protocol implementations. Using this specification during testing is expected
    to minimize the risk of non-interoperability.
