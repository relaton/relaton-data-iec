abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24727 defines a set of programming interfaces for interactions
    between integrated circuit cards and external applications to include generic
    services for multi-sector use. ISO/IEC 24727-4:2008 standardizes the connectivity
    and security mechanisms between the client-application and the card-application.It
    specifies API-Administration of service-independent and implementation-independent
    ISO/IEC 24727 compliant modules, including security, that enables action requests
    to a specific card-application of an integrated circuit card such that, when coupled
    to data model and content discovery operations, the card-application can be used
    by a variety of client-applications.
