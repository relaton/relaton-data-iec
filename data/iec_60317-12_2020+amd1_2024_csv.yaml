abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-12:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    round copper winding wires of class 120 with a sole coating based on polyvinyl
    acetal or polyvinyl formal resin, which can be modified provided it retains the
    chemical identity of the original resin and meets all specified wire requirements.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 A modified resin is a resin that has undergone a chemical change,
    or contains one or more additives to enhance certain performance or application
    characteristics.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Polyvinyl acetal is a general name for a family
    of thermoplastic vinyl resins produced by the condensation of polyvinyl alcohol
    with an aldehyde. Examples are polyvinyl acetal, polyvinyl formal and polyvinyl
    butyral. The range of nominal conductor diameters covered by this document is:<br
    />\r\n- Grade 1: 0,040 mm up to and including 2,500 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2: 0,040
    mm up to and including 5,000 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 3: 0,080 mm up to and including
    5,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe nominal conductor diameters are specified in Clause 4 of
    IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This fourth edition of IEC 60317-12 cancels and replaces the
    third edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- modification of the Scope;<br />\r\n- addition
    of reference to transformer oil resistance test method in Clause 20."
