    <p>The aim of ISO/IEC TR 18015 is to:</p>
    <ul><li>give the reader a model of time and space overheads implied by use of various C++ language and library features;</li><li>debunk widespread myths about performance problems in C++;</li><li>present techniques for use of C++ in applications where performance matters; and</li><li>present techniques for implementing C++ standard language and library facilities to yield efficient code.</li></ul>
    <p>The special needs of embedded systems programming are presented, including ROMability and predictability. A separate chapter presents general C and C++ interfaces to the basic hardware facilities of embedded systems.</p>
