abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 provides guidance and criteria for the security
    evaluation of operational systems. It provides an extension to the scope of ISO/IEC
    15408 by taking into account a number of critical aspects of operational systems
    not addressed in ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation. The principal extensions that are required
    address evaluation of the operational environment surrounding the target of evaluation,
    and the decomposition of complex operational systems into security domains that
    can be separately evaluated.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 provides:</p><ol><li>
    a definition and model for operational systems;</li><li> a description of the
    extensions to ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation concepts needed to evaluate such operational
    systems;</li><li> a methodology and process for performing the security evaluation
    of operational systems;</li><li> additional security evaluation criteria to address
    those aspects of operational systems not covered by the ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation
    criteria.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 permits the incorporation of security
    products evaluated against ISO/IEC 15408 into operational systems evaluated as
    a whole using ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 is limited to
    the security evaluation of operational systems and does not consider other forms
    of system assessment. It does not define techniques for the identification, assessment
    and acceptance of operational risk.</p>"
