abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 provides guidance and criteria for the security
    evaluation of operational systems. It provides an extension to the scope of ISO/IEC
    15408 by taking into account a number of critical aspects of operational systems
    not addressed in ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation. The principal extensions that are required
    address evaluation of the operational environment surrounding the target of evaluation,
    and the decomposition of complex operational systems into security domains that
    can be separately evaluated.  ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010 provides:          a definition
    and model for operational systems;         a description of the extensions to
    ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation concepts needed to evaluate such operational systems;         a
    methodology and process for performing the security evaluation of operational
    systems;         additional security evaluation criteria to address those aspects
    of operational systems not covered by the ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation criteria.     ISO/IEC
    TR 19791:2010 permits the incorporation of security products evaluated against
    ISO/IEC 15408 into operational systems evaluated as a whole using ISO/IEC TR 19791:2010.  ISO/IEC
    TR 19791:2010 is limited to the security evaluation of operational systems and
    does not consider other forms of system assessment. It does not define techniques
    for the identification, assessment and acceptance of operational risk.'
