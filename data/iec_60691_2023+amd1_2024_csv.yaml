abstract:
- content: "IEC 60691:2023+AMD1:2024 CSV is applicable to thermal-links intended for
    incorporation in electrical appliances, electronic equipment and component parts
    thereof, normally intended for use indoors, in order to protect them against excessive
    temperatures under abnormal conditions.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The equipment is not designed
    to generate heat.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The effectiveness of the protection against
    excessive temperatures logically depends upon the position and method of mounting
    of the thermal-link, as well as upon the current which it is carrying.<br />\r\nThis
    document may be applicable to thermal-links for use under conditions other than
    indoors, provided that the climatic and other circumstances in the immediate surroundings
    of such thermal-links are comparable with those in this standard. This document
    may be applicable to thermal-links in their simplest forms (e.g. melting strips
    or wires), provided that molten materials expelled during function cannot adversely
    interfere with the safe use of the equipment, especially in the case of hand-held
    or portable equipment, irrespective of its position."
