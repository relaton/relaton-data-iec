abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 60076-57-129:2017(E) specifies requirements of liquid-immersed
    three-phase and single-phase converter transformers for use in high voltage direct
    current (HVDC) power transmission systems including back-to-back applications.
    It applies to transformers having two, three or multiple windings.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to:<br />\r\n- converter transformers for industrial applications
    (see IEC 61378-1 or IEEE C57.18.10);<br />\r\n- converter transformers for traction
    applications (see IEC 60310).<br />\r\nThis publication cancels and replaces the
    first edition of IEC 61378-2 published in 2001 and IEEE Std C57.129â„¢ published
    in 2007."
