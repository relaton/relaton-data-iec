  content: "IEC TR 63191:2018(E) specifies recommendations about power quality measurement
    and assessment within installations.<br />\r\nIEC TR 63191:2018 outlines the various
    phases needed for the establishment of a demand side power quality measurement
    plan for buildings and industry installations.<br />\r\nSuch a power quality measurement
    plan will enable the optimization of the energy availability and efficiency, improve
    the assets lifetime and facilitate the resolutions of power quality problems.
    A power quality measurement plan encompasses the following stages:<br />\r\n•
    \   definition of the context, objectives and constraints;<br />\r\n•    assessment
    of the initial power quality situation;<br />\r\n•    definition of an action
    plan for the improvement of the power quality situation;<br />\r\n•    implementation
    of the power quality measuring system;<br />\r\n•    exploitation of the measurement
    system for the improvement of the power quality situation;<br />\r\n•    maintenance
    of the measurement system.<br />\r\nIEC TR 63191:2018 will also help facility
    managers to tailor their measurement plan to the specific needs of the electrical
    system under their control. It addresses all the disturbances present in such
    networks, but does not cover the disturbances present in public electrical distribution
    networks (supply side) as they are governed by specific documents such as EN 50160
    and IEC TS 62749."
