abstract:
- content: "IEC 62282-7-2:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62282-7-2:2025
    applies to SOFC cell/stack assembly units, testing systems, instruments and measuring
    methods, and specifies test methods to test the performance of SOFC cells and
    stacks. This document is not applicable to small button cells that are designed
    for SOFC material testing and provide no practical means of fuel utilization measurement.
    This document is used based on the recommendation of the entity that provides
    the cell performance specification or for acquiring data on a cell or stack in
    order to estimate the performance of a system based on it. Users of this document
    can selectively execute test items suitable for their purposes from those described
    in this document."
