abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies a protocol which is used by Network
    Layer entities operating the protocol specified in</p><p>ISO 8473 in Intermediate
    Systems to maintain routeing information for the purpose of routeing within a
    single routeing</p><p>domain. The protocol specified in this International Standard
    relies upon the provision of a connectionless-mode underlying</p><p>service.1)</p><p>This
    International Standard specifies:</p><p>a) procedures for the transmission of
    configuration and routeing information between network entities residing in</p><p>Intermediate
    Systems within a single routeing domain;</p><p>b) the encoding of the protocol
    data units used for the transmission of the configuration and routeing information;</p><p>c)
    procedures for the correct interpretation of protocol control information; and</p><p>d)
    the functional requirements for implementations claiming conformance to this International
    Standard.</p><p>The procedures are defined in terms of</p><p>a) the interactions
    between Intermediate system Network entities through the exchange of protocol
    data units;</p><p>b) the interactions between a Network entity and an underlying
    service provider through the exchange of subnetwork service</p><p>primitives;
    and</p><p>c) the constraints on route determination which must be observed by
    each Intermediate system when each has a routeing</p><p>information base which
    is consistent with the others.</p>"
