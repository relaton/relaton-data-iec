abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be  downloaded
    \ from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 10489:2002 This International Standard specifies a protocol which
    is used by Network Layer entities operating the protocol specified in ISO 8473
    in Intermediate Systems to maintain routeing information for the purpose of routeing
    within a single routeing domain. The protocol specified in this International
    Standard relies upon the provision of a connectionless-mode underlying service.<br
    />\r\nThis International Standard specifies:<br />\r\na) procedures for the transmission
    of configuration and routeing information between network entities residing in
    Intermediate Systems within a single routeing domain;<br />\r\nb) the encoding
    of the protocol data units used for the transmission of the configuration and
    routeing information;<br />\r\nc) procedures for the correct interpretation of
    protocol control information; and<br />\r\nd) the functional requirements for
    implementations claiming conformance to this International Standard.<br />\r\nThe
    procedures are defined in terms of<br />\r\na) the interactions between Intermediate
    system Network entities through the exchange of protocol data units;<br />\r\nb)
    the interactions between a Network entity and an underlying service provider through
    the exchange of subnetwork service primitives; and<br />\r\nc) the constraints
    on route determination which must be observed by each Intermediate system when
    each has a routeing information base which is consistent with the others."
