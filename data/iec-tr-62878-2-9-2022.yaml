  content: IEC TR 62878-2-9:2022(E) comprises the long-term discussion among Jisso
    International Council (JIC) members during 1999 and 2005, when the interim agreement
    among all JIC members about the “concept of Jisso” as well as the “Jisso product
    level” for the common understanding on IEC TC 91 (electronic assembly technology)
    activities was reached. Further discussion on “Jisso Product Level” could be needed
    among the current JIC members to finalize it in the near future based on this
    technical report.
