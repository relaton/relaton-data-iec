abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 establishes a common framework of process descriptions
    for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans. It defines a set of
    processes and associated terminology from an engineering viewpoint. These processes
    can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a system''s structure. Selected
    sets of these processes can be applied throughout the life cycle for managing
    and performing the stages of a system''s life cycle. This is accomplished through
    the involvement of all stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer
    satisfaction. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 also provides processes that support the
    definition, control and improvement of the system life cycle processes used within
    an organization or a project. Organizations and projects can use these processes
    when acquiring and supplying systems. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015 concerns those systems
    that are man-made and may be configured with one or more of the following system
    elements: hardware, software, data, humans, processes (e.g., processes for providing
    service to users), procedures (e.g., operator instructions), facilities, materials
    and naturally occurring entities.'
