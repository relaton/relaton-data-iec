  content: "IEC 62858:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 62858:2019 introduces
    and discusses all necessary measures to make reliable and homogeneous the values
    of ground flash density, NG and ground strike point density, NSG, obtained from
    lightning location systems (LLSs) in various countries. Only parameters that are
    relevant to risk assessment are considered. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Two informative annexes are introduced dealing
    with the determination of lightning density for risk calculation (Annex A) and
    ground strike point calculation methods (Annex B).</p>"
