abstract:
- content: "This technical report gives guidance on the treatment of uncertainties
    to those who are involved in the development or modification of CISPR electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) standards. In addition, this part provides useful background
    information for those who apply the standards and the uncertainty aspects in practice.
    \n\nThe objectives of this technical report are:\n\na) to identify the parameters
    or sources governing the uncertainty associated with the statement that a given
    product complies with the requirement specified in a CISPR recommendation. This
    uncertainty will be called 'standards compliance uncertainty'.\n\nb) to give guidance
    on the estimation of the magnitude of the standards compliance uncertainty;\n\nc)
    to give guidance for the implementation of the standards compliance uncertainty
    into the compliance criterion of a CISPR standardised compliance test.\n\nAs such,
    this part can be considered as a handbook that can be used by standards writers
    to incorporate and harmonise uncertainty considerations in existing and future
    CISPR standards. This part also gives guidance to regulatory authorities, accreditation
    bodies and test engineers to judge the performance quality of an EMC test-laboratory
    carrying out CISPR standardised compliance tests. The uncertainty considerations
    given in this part can also be used as guidance when comparing test results (and
    its uncertainties) obtained by using different alternative test methods.\n\nCISPR
    16-3 has been reorganised into 4 parts, to accommodate growth and easier maintenance.
    This first edition of CISPR 16-4-1, together with CISPR 16-4-3, CISPR 16-4-4 and
    the second edition of CISPR 16-3, cancels and replaces the first edition of CISPR
    16-3, published in 2000, and its amendment 1 (2002). It contains the relevant
    clauses of CISPR 16-3 without technical changes."
