    of the requirements</p><p>placed upon providers of POSIX test methods for POSIX.1
    (ISO/IEC 9945-1:1990; IEEE Std</p><p>1003.1-1990). These requirements consist
    of a POSIX.1-ordered list of assertions defining those</p><p>aspects of POSIX.1
    that are to be tested and the associated test methods that are to be used in</p><p>performing
    those tests. This standard is aimed primarily at POSIX.1 test suite providers
    and</p><p>POSIX.1 implementors. This standard specifies those aspects of POSIX.1
    that shall be verified by</p><p>conformance test methods.</p>"
