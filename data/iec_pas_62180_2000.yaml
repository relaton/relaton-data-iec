abstract:
- content: Establishes a standard procedure for testing and classifying microcircuits
    according to their susceptibility to damage or degradation by exposure to a defined
    machine Model (MM) electrostatic discharge (ESD). The objective is to provide
    reliable, repeatable MM ESD test results so that accurate classifications can
    be performed.
