  content: "IEC TS 62896:2015(E) applies to hybrid insulators for a.c. and d.c. applications
    consisting of a load-bearing insulating solid or hollow core consisting of ceramic
    or glass, a housing (defined geometry, outside the insulating core) made of polymeric
    material and end fittings permanently attached to the insulating core. Hybrid
    insulators covered by this technical specification are intended for use as suspension/tension
    line insulators, line post insulators, station post insulators and hollow core
    insulators for apparatus. The object of this technical specification is to:<br
    />\r\n- define the terms used;<br />\r\n- prescribe test methods;<br />\r\n- prescribe
    acceptance criteria.<br />\r\nSilicone or other functional coatings (CIGRE Technical
    Brochure No. 478, Appendix B), booster sheds, shed extenders and rain deflectors
    are not within the scope of this technical specification. This technical specification
    does not include requirements dealing with the choice of insulators for specific
    operating conditions."
