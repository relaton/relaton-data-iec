abstract:
- content: "<p>standard addresses the construction and use</p><p>of test suites for
    verifying conformance of SGML</p><p>systems. Its provisions assist those who build
    test</p><p>suites, those who build SGML systems to be evaluated</p><p>by such
    suites, and those who examine an</p><p>SGML system's performance on a test suite
    as part</p><p>of the process of selecting an SGML tool.</p><p>In particular, this
    standard includes:</p><p>? criteria for the organization of test suites,</p><p>including
    naming conventions, documentation</p><p>conventions, and specification of applicable
    concrete</p><p>syntaxes and features. Among other</p><p>advantages, these conventions
    facilitate any</p><p>non-SGML automatic processing that may be</p><p>convenient
    for the developers or the users of the</p><p>tests;</p><p>NOTE? An example of
    such non-SGML processing is</p><p>sorting tests by name.</p><p>? a standard form
    for describing test results</p><p>that makes clear what has been proven or disproven</p><p>by
    the tests;</p><p>? the specification of a Reference Application</p><p>for SGML
    Testing (RAST) that interprets all</p><p>markup to allow machine comparison of
    test</p><p>results for documents conforming to ISO 8879.</p><p>RAST indicates
    in a standard way when tags,</p><p>processing instructions, and data are recognized</p><p>by
    the parser, replacing references and processing</p><p>markup declarations and
    marked sections</p><p>appropriately. RAST tests information likely to be</p><p>passed
    by a general-purpose SGML parser to an</p><p>application but does not test additional
    information</p><p>that some parsers provide;</p><p>? the specification of a Reference
    Application</p><p>for Capacity Testing (RACT) that reports a validating</p><p>parser's
    capacity calculations. An SGML</p><p>systemthat supports this application indicates
    its</p><p>ability to report capacity errors regardless of</p><p>whether it supports
    variant capacity sets;</p><p>? the specification of test procedures related to</p><p>SDIF
    data streams.</p><p>This standard applies to the testing only of aspects</p><p>of
    SGML implementation and usage for which</p><p>objective conformance criteria are
    defined in</p><p>ISO 8879.</p><p>NOTE? Among the aspects of an SGML system not</p><p>addressed
    by this standard are error recovery, phrasing</p><p>of error messages, application
    results, and</p><p>documentation (including the system declaration).</p>"
