abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14143-1:2007 defines the concepts of FSM (Functional Size Measurement).
    The concepts of Functional Size Measurement (FSM) are designed to overcome the
    limitations of earlier methods of sizing software by shifting the focus away from
    measuring how the software is implemented to measuring size in terms of the functions
    required by the user.
