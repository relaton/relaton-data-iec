abstract:
- content: "IEC 62396-8:2020 is intended to provide awareness and guidance with regard
    to the effects of small particles (that is, protons, electrons, pions and muon
    fluxes) and single event effects on avionics electronics used in aircraft operating
    at altitudes up to 60 000 feet (18 300 m). This is an emerging topic and lacks
    substantive supporting data. This document is intended to help aerospace or ground
    level electronic equipment manufacturers and designers by providing awareness
    guidance for this new emerging topic.<br />\r\nDetails of the radiation environment
    are provided together with identification of potential problems caused as a result
    of the atmospheric radiation received. Appropriate methods are given for quantifying
    single event effect (SEE) rates in electronic components."
