abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62368-2:2025 identifies the purpose and applicability of IEC 62368-1:2023
    and the exclusions from the scope. The scope excludes requirements for functional
    safety. Functional safety is addressed in IEC 61508-1. Because the scope includes
    computers that can control safety systems, functional safety requirements would
    necessarily include requirements for computer processes and software. The requirements
    provided in IEC 60950-23 can be modified and added to IEC 62368 as another -X
    document. However, because of the hazard-based nature of IEC 62368-1, the requirements
    from IEC 60950-23 have been incorporated into the body of IEC 62368-1 and made
    more generic. The intent of the addition of the IEC 60950-23 requirements is to
    maintain the overall intent of the technical requirements from IEC 60950-23, incorporate
    them into IEC 62368-1 following the overall format of IEC 62368-1 and simplify
    and facilitate the application of these requirements. Robots traditionally are
    covered under the scopes of ISO documents, typically maintained by ISO TC 299.
    ISO TC 299 has working groups for personal care robots and service robots, and
    produces for example, ISO 13482, Robots and robotic devices - Safety requirements
    for personal care robots. In this document, only those subclauses from IEC 62368-1
    considered to need further background reference information or explanation to
    benefit the user in applying the relevant requirements are included. Therefore,
    not all numbered subclauses are cited. Unless otherwise noted, all references
    are to clauses, subclauses, annexes, figures or tables located in IEC 62368â€‘1:2023.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2018.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) It takes into account changes made in the fourth edition of IEC 62368-1
    (IEC 62368-1:2023) as identified in the Foreword of IEC 62368 1:2023"
