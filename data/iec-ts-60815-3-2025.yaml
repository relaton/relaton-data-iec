  content: "IEC TS 60815-3:2025, which is a technical specification, is applicable
    for the selection of polymeric insulators for AC systems, and the determination
    of their relevant dimensions, to be used in high voltage systems with respect
    to pollution. The specification applies to insulators for outdoor installation
    only.<br />\r\nThis document gives specific guidelines and principles to arrive
    at an informed judgement on the probable behaviour of a given insulator in certain
    pollution environment.<br />\r\nThe contents of this document are based on CIGRE
    TB 158 and CIGRE TB 361, which form a useful complement to this document for those
    wishing to study in greater depth the performance of insulators under pollution.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not deal with the effects of snow or ice on polluted
    insulators. Although this subject is dealt with by CIGRE TB 158, current knowledge
    is very limited and practice is too diverse.<br />\r\nThe objective of this document
    is to give the user means to<br />\r\n- determine the reference unified specific
    creepage distance (RUSCD) from site pollution severity (SPS) value or class,<br
    />\r\n- choose appropriate profiles,<br />\r\n- apply correction factors for altitude,
    insulator shape, size and position, etc. to the RUSCD.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    of IEC TS 60815-3, together with IEC TS 60815-1, cancels and replaces the first
    edition of IEC TS 60815-3:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Terms and definitions are modified or introduced
    in this document;<br />\r\nb) From RUSCD of reference insulator to USCD of candidate
    insulator, the correction factors are introduced and revised, such as altitude
    correction, diameter correction, shed profile correction and - parallel insulator
    number correction;<br />\r\nd) The general guidance on materials is revised. The
    concept of hydrophobicity transfer and hydrophobicity transfer material (HTM)
    are introduced, recognising that a reduced creepage distance may be used for HTM
    insulators."
