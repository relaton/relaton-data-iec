- content: "<p>Procurements of biometric systems often stipulate requirements for
    the systems to be inclusive and make provision for exception handling.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 29194:2015 provides guidance for biometric system design and procurement to
    handle the range of accessibility and usability issues. This report will build
    upon the generic guidance in ISO/IEC/TR 24714‑1, Information technology? Biometrics?
    Jurisdictional and societal considerations for commercial applications? Part 1:
    General guidance.</p>"
