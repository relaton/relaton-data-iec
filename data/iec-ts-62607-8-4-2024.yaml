  content: "IEC 62607-8-4:2024 specifies a measurement protocol to determine the key
    control characteristic<br />\r\n- activation energy of electronic trap states<br
    />\r\nfor metal-oxide interfacial devices by<br />\r\n- low-frequency-noise spectroscopy<br
    />\r\nThe noise spectra peak temperatures are obtained within a designated temperature
    range. Activation energies are then calculated based on the frequency dependence
    of the peak temperatures to analyse the energy levels associated with the electronic
    trap states. The activation energy is determined by the temperature dependence
    of the capture time at electron traps under the assumption that it is described
    by an Arrhenius function.<br />\r\n- In metal-oxide interfacial devices, electrical
    conductance is observed through an oxide nanolayer sandwiched between metal electrodes.<br
    />\r\n- The size of the conductive path in metal-oxide interfacial devices is
    dependent on the current value and is usually nanoscale in diameter, taking the
    form of a filamentary wire. This evaluation method is useful for analysing the
    electronic trap states in nanowires and other miniaturized devices that have nanolayers."
