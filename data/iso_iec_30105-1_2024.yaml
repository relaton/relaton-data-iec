    to plan, establish, implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve
    its services.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies the process reference
    model (PRM). It contains process definitions across the lifecycle described in
    terms of process context, purpose and outcomes, together with a framework defining
    relationships between the processes.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">The process purpose
    details the high-level objective of performing the process such that implementation
    of the process leads to tangible benefits for stakeholders. The process outcomes
    are clearly defined by observable results and aligned to the business benefits
    derived by the customer and service provider.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document:</p><p
