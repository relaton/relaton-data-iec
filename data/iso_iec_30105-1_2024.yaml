    the outsourced business processes. It defines the processes to plan, establish,
    implement, operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve its services.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies the process reference model (PRM). It contains process definitions
    across the lifecycle described in terms of process context, purpose and outcomes,
    together with a framework defining relationships between the processes.<br />\r\nThe
    process purpose details the high-level objective of performing the process such
    that implementation of the process leads to tangible benefits for stakeholders.
    The process outcomes are clearly defined by observable results and aligned to
    the business benefits derived by the customer and service provider.<br />\r\nThis
    document:<br />\r\n- covers IT enabled business processes that are outsourced;<br
    />\r\n- is not intended to address IT processes, but includes references to them
    at key touchpoints for completeness;<br />\r\n- is applicable to the service provider,
    not to the customer;<br />\r\n- is applicable to all lifecycle processes of ITES-BPO;<br
    />\r\n- serves as a PRM for organizations providing ITES-BPO services."
