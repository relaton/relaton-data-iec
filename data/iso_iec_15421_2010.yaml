abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15421:2010 specifies the requirements and test methods for physical
    and related attributes of a bar code master. It covers all forms of bar code master,
    irrespective of the mode of origination of the initial image, intended for reproduction
    by conventional printing processes. ISO/IEC 15421:2010 does not cover processes
    in which there is no master, such as computer to plate (CTP).
