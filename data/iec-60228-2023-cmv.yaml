  content: "IEC 60228:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60228:2023 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60228:2004
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 20 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60228:2023 specifies the nominal cross-sectional areas, in
    the range 0,5 mm2 to 3 500 mm2, for conductors in electric power cables and cords
    of a wide range of types. Requirements for numbers and sizes of wires and resistance
    values are also included. These conductors include solid, stranded and Milliken,
    copper, aluminium and aluminium alloy conductors in cables for fixed installations
    and flexible copper conductors. This document does not apply to conductors for
    telecommunication purposes. The applicability of this document to a particular
    type of cable is as specified in the standard for the type of cable. Unless specified
    otherwise in a particular clause, IEC 60028 ED4 relates to the conductors in the
    finished cable and not to the conductor as made or supplied for inclusion into
    a cable. Conductors described in this document are specified in metric sizes.
    Informative annexes provide supplementary information covering temperature correction
    factors for resistance measurement (Annex B) and guidance on dimensional limits
    of circular conductors (Annex C). This document has the status of a horizontal
    publication in accordance with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/65418\">IEC
    Guide 108</a>."
