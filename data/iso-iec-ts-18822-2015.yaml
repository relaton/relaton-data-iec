  content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 18822:2015 specifies requirements for implementations of
    an interface that computer programs written in the C++ programming language may
    use to perform operations on file systems and their components, such as paths,
    regular files, and directories. This Technical Specification is applicable to
    information technology systems that can access hierarchical file systems, such
    as those with operating systems that conform to the POSIX (3) interface. This
    Technical Specification is applicable only to vendors who wish to provide the
    interface it describes.</p>"
