    <p>ISO/IEC 15940:2006 defines the software engineering environment (SEE) services conceptually in a reference model that can be adapted to any SEEs to automate one or more software engineering activities.</p>
    <p>It describes services that support the process definitions as in ISO/IEC 12207 so that the set of SEE Services are compatible with ISO/IEC 12207.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15940:2006 can be used either as a general reference, or to define an automated software process.</p>
