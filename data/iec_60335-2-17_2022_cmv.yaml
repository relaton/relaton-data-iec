abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-17:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-17:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-17:2012+AMD1:2015+AMD2:2019
    CSV edition 3.2. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-17:2022 deals
    with the safety of electric blankets, pads, clothing and other flexible appliances
    that heat the bed or human body, for household and similar purposes, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to control
    units supplied with the appliance.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal
    household use but which nevertheless possibly pose be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used in beauty parlours or by persons
    in cold ambient temperatures, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nRequirements
    and tests for clothing are given in normative Annex CC.<br />\r\nAs far as is
    practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n–
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nChildren are considered to be old
    enough to use an appliance without supervision when they have been adequately
    instructed by a parent or guardian and are deemed competent to use the appliance
    safely.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for appliances
    intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– rigid bed warmers, such as those of metal or
    ceramic material;<br />\r\n– water bed heaters (IEC 60335-2-66);<br />\r\n– heating
    appliances for breeding and rearing animals (IEC 60335-2-71);<br />\r\n– foot
    warmers and heating mats (IEC 60335-2-81);<br />\r\n– appliances specifically
    intended for use under medical supervision (IEC 60601-2-35);<br />\r\n– heated
    carpets (IEC 60335-2-106).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the
    third edition published in 2012, Amendment 1:2015 and Amendment 2:2019. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 19.106, 21.103, 21.104, 21.110, 30.1, 30.102, Annex BB, CC.19.3);<br
    />\r\nc) clarification of the definition of control unit (3.6.105);<br />\r\nd)
    revision for adjusting the supply voltage of appliances, other than controlled
    appliances, when operation at rated power input times a factor is specified (5.12);<br
    />\r\ne) clarification of testing of blankets that cannot be folded with five
    thicknesses (19.101);<br />\r\nf) updated compliance criteria to include breakage
    of electrodes (21.1);<br />\r\ng) clarification of the test method for mattresses
    based on the rigidity index of the flexible part (21.111.1, Annex DD);<br />\r\nh)
    clarification for testing heating elements with a non-circular construction (21.111.3);<br
    />\r\ni) addition of requirements to protect the user from overheating in the
    event of an interruption in the mains supply (22.110)<br />\r\nj) inclusion of
    pressure test method from IEC 60320-1:2001 (30.1);<br />\r\nk) update of test
    methods for resistance to fire tests (30.101.1, 30.102).<br />\r\nThis part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
