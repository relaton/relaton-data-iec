    <p>This document describes numbering systems that are available for the identification of RF tags and assigns various allocation classes to various agencies that issue manufacturer codes.</p>
    <p>The unique ID can be used:</p>
    <p>—          for the traceability of the integrated circuit itself for quality control in its manufacturing process;</p>
    <p>—          for the traceability of the RF tag during its manufacturing process and along its lifetime;</p>
    <p>—          for the completion of the reading in a multi-antenna configuration;</p>
    <p>—          by the anti-collision mechanism to inventory multiple tags in the reader's field of view; and</p>
    <p>—          for the traceability of the item to which the RF tag is attached.</p>
