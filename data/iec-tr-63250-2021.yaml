  content: "IEC TR 63250:2021 deals with the determination of repeatability and reproducibility
    of test methods used for assessing the performance characteristics of household
    and similar electrical appliances. It also provides guidance for carrying out
    round robin tests (RRT).<br />\r\nIt also specifies the uncertainty reporting
    of measurements of household and similar electrical appliances.<br />\r\nIt describes
    methods to estimate the uncertainty of a measured result and to predict the range
    of measured values when the same appliance is measured in another laboratory applying
    the same measurement method.<br />\r\nIt does not cover the development of measurement
    methods. It also does not deal with:<br />\r\n– the production variability of
    the appliance;<br />\r\n– how closely the measurement method reflects the normal
    use of appliances in households."
