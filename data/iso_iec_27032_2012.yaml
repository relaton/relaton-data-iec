abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 27032:2012 provides guidance for improving the state of Cybersecurity,
    drawing out the unique aspects of that activity and its dependencies on other
    security domains, in particular:    information security,   network security,   internet
    security, and   critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP).     It
    covers the baseline security practices for stakeholders in the Cyberspace. This
    International Standard provides:    an overview of Cybersecurity,   an explanation
    of the relationship between Cybersecurity and other types of security,   a definition
    of stakeholders and a description of their roles in Cybersecurity,   guidance
    for addressing common Cybersecurity issues, and   a framework to enable stakeholders
    to collaborate on resolving Cybersecurity issues.'
