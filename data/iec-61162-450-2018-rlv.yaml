  content: "IEC 61162-450:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61162-450:2018
    specifies interface requirements and methods of test for high speed communication
    between shipboard navigation and radiocommunication equipment as well as between
    such systems and other ship systems that need to communicate with navigation and
    radio-communication equipment. This document is based on the application of an
    appropriate suite of existing international standards to provide a framework for
    implementing data transfer between devices on a shipboard Ethernet network. This
    document specifies an Ethernet based bus type network where any listener can receive
    messages from any sender with the following properties.<br />\r\n- This document
    includes provisions for multicast distribution of information formatted according
    to IEC 61162-1, for example position fixes and other measurements, as well as
    provisions for transmission of general data blocks (binary file), for example
    between radar and VDR, and also includes provisions for multicast distribution
    of information formatted according to IEC 61162-3, for example position fixes
    and other measurements.<br />\r\n- This document is limited to protocols for equipment
    (network nodes) connected to a single Ethernet network consisting only of OSI
    level one or two devices and cables (Network infrastructure).<br />\r\n- This
    document provides requirements only for equipment interfaces. By specifying protocols
    for transmission of IEC 61162-1 sentences, IEC 61162-3 PGN messages and general
    binary file data, these requirements will guarantee interoperability between equipment
    implementing this document as well as a certain level of safe behaviour of the
    equipment itself.<br />\r\n- This document permits equipment using other protocols
    than those specified in this document to share a network infrastructure, provided
    that it is supplied with interfaces which satisfy the requirements described for
    ONF.<br />\r\n- This document includes provisions for filtering of the network
    traffic in order to limit the amount of traffic to manageable level for each individual
    equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not contain any system requirements other
    than the ones that can be inferred from the sum of individual equipment requirements.
    An associated standard, IEC 61162-460, further addresses system requirements.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition of IEC 61162-450 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2011 and Amendment 1:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) network traffic filtering based on IGMP snooping
    added;<br />\r\nb) network traffic balancing added;<br />\r\nc) new encapsulation
    of IEC 61162-3 PGNs added;<br />\r\nd) new alternative for binary file transfer
    added: TCP/IP based on Annex H of IEC 62388:2007 on radars;<br />\r\ne) general
    authentication tag \"a:\" added to support managing of cyber security risk."
