abstract:
- content: "IEC 60838-1:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60838-1:2016 applies
    to lampholders of miscellaneous types intended for building-in (to be used with
    general purpose light sources, projection lamps, floodlighting lamps and street-lighting
    lamps with caps as listed in Annex A) and the methods of test to be used in determining
    the safe use of lamps in lampholders. This fifth edition cancels and replaces
    the fourth edition published in 2004, Amendment 1:2008 and Amendment 2:2011. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. The significant technical changes in
    this edition with respect to the previous edition include the introduction of
    new or revised requirements for single and dual contact ignition voltages, steel
    test caps and brass test caps and an Annex E listing amended requirements/clauses
    which require products to be retested."
