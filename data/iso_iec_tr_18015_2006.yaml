    <p>The aim of ISO/IEC TR 18015 is to:</p>
    give the reader a model of time and space overheads implied by use of various C++ language and library features;debunk widespread myths about performance problems in C++;present techniques for use of C++ in applications where performance matters; andpresent techniques for implementing C++ standard language and library facilities to yield efficient code.<p>The special needs of embedded systems programming are presented, including ROMability and predictability. A separate chapter presents general C and C++ interfaces to the basic hardware facilities of embedded systems.</p>
