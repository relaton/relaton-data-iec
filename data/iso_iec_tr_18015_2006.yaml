abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>The aim of ISO/IEC TR 18015 is
    to:</p><ul><li>give the reader a model of time and space overheads implied by
    use of various C++ language and library features;</li><li>debunk widespread myths
    about performance problems in C++;</li><li>present techniques for use of C++ in
    applications where performance matters; and</li><li>present techniques for implementing
    C++ standard language and library facilities to yield efficient code.</li></ul><p>The
    special needs of embedded systems programming are presented, including ROMability
    and predictability. A separate chapter presents general C and C++ interfaces to
    the basic hardware facilities of embedded systems.</p>
