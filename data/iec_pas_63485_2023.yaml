abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 63485:2023 addresses creators of information for use of products.
    Examples of information creators are information architects and technical communicators.<br
    />\r\nThe document defines requirements for electronic request and delivery processes
    for any kind of information for use. Such processes are needed to bridge the gap
    between objects in the real world and the information needed by their dedicated
    users, especially in the context of smart manufacturing, industry 4.0 and the
    industrial internet of things. This document specifies processes in order to enable
    n:m relations between information sources and information users when there is
    no explicit agreement between information provider and information consumer. This
    document also specifies metadata."
