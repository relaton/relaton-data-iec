abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594-7:2008 defines a number of object classes and name forms
    that may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory. The
    definition of an object class involves listing a number of attribute types that
    are relevant to objects of that class. The definition of a name form involves
    naming the object class to which it applies and listing the attributes to be used
    in forming names for objects of that class. These definitions are used by the
    administrative authority that is responsible for the management of the directory
    information.</p><p>Any administrative authority can define its own object classes
    or subclasses and name forms for any purpose.</p><p>Such definitions can optionally
    use the notation specified in ISO/IEC 9594-2. It is recommended that an object
    class defined in ISO/IEC 9594-7:2008, or a subclass derived from one, or a name
    form defined in ISO/IEC 9594-7:2008, be used in preference to the generation of
    a new one, whenever the semantics is appropriate for the application.</p><p>Administrative
    authorities may support some or all of the selected object classes and name forms,
    and may also add additional ones.</p><p>All administrative authorities shall support
    the object classes that the directory uses for its own purposes (the top, alias
    and DSA object classes).</p>"
