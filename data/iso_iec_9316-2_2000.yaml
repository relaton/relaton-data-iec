abstract:
- content: SCSI provides a diverse range of peripherals for attachment to a wide range
    of computing equipment. Some system manufacturers have developed approaches for
    SCSI attachment which are widely followed, increasing the applications available
    for the attachment of SCSI peripherals. In markets where no standard method of
    attachment exists, however, variations between third party sellers have made it
    nearly impossible for end users to attach more than one SCSI peripheral to one
    host bus adapter. In an effort to broaden the application base for SCSI peripherals,
    an ad hoc industry group of companies representing system integrators, controllers,
    peripherals, and semiconductors decided to address the issues involved. That effort
    has evolved into this International Standard. Its purpose is to define a method
    whereby multiple environments may adopt a common procedure for the support of
    SCSI devices. The CAM provides a structured method for supporting peripherals
    with the software (e.g. device driver) and hardware (e.g. host bus adapter) associated
    with any computer.
