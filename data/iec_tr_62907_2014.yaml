abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62709:2014 comprises seventeen use cases for Ambient Assisted Living
    submitted to IEC between June 2012 and September 2013. The use cases are based
    on the identified requirements of elderly people and people with disabilities.
    The use case scenarios demonstrate both the usability barriers and functional
    requirements. In addition, the accessibility principles developed in ISO/IEC Guide
    71 were applied. A further objective of this report is to highlight potential
    areas for standardisation in the AAL environment to ensure ease of operation and
    interoperability with a focus on specific aspects relating to audio, video and
    multimedia equipment.
