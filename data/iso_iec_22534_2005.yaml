abstract:
- content: "<p>The services defined in ISO/IEC 22534:2005 are used to establish and
    maintain a relationship between an application and a server for the purpose of
    exchanging application messages. For the purpose of ISO/IEC 22534:2005, this relationship
    is called an application session.</p><p>Application protocols, such as ECMA-323,
    require that an application session is established before application messages
    are exchanged. ECMA-269 specifies several mechanisms for establishing an application
    context. One possible mechanism is ACSE (ISO/IEC 8649) - but since ASCE uses ASN.1
    encoding for its services, it is not desirable for use with XML based protocols
    such as ECMA-323.</p><p>ISO/IEC 22534:2005 provides an XML-based alternative for
    establishing application sessions.</p>"
