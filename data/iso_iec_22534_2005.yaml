abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThe
    services defined in ISO/IEC 22534:2005 are used to establish and maintain a relationship
    between an application and a server for the purpose of exchanging application
    messages. For the purpose of ISO/IEC 22534:2005, this relationship is called an
    application session.<br />\r\nApplication protocols, such as ECMA-323, require
    that an application session is established before application messages are exchanged.
    ECMA-269 specifies several mechanisms for establishing an application context.
    One possible mechanism is ACSE (ISO/IEC 8649) - but since ASCE uses ASN.1 encoding
    for its services, it is not desirable for use with XML based protocols such as
    ECMA-323.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 22534:2005 provides an XML-based alternative for establishing
    application sessions."
