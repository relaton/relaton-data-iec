  content: "IEC 63093-5:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 63093-5:2025
    specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical interchangeability
    for a preferred range of EP-cores made of ferrite, the essential dimensions of
    coil formers to be used with them and the locations of their terminal pins on
    a 2,50 mm printed wiring grid in relation to the base outlines of the cores and
    the effective parameter values to be used in calculations involving them. It also
    gives guidelines on allowable limits of surface irregularities applicable to EP-cores.
    The specifications contained in this document are useful in negotiations between
    ferrite core suppliers and users about surface irregularities. The general considerations
    upon which the design of this range of cores is based are as given in Annex A.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of Table 2 according to IEC 60205:2016."
