  content: "IEC TR 62839-1:2014(E) specifies the PSR (product specific rules) for
    wires and cables used for communication, data, control and command. This PSR covers
    the use, installation and end-of-life stages and provides methodological precisions
    to PEP/PCR writing for \"wires and cables and accessories products used for communication,
    data, control and command. PSR and general rules all together form the product
    category rules. Three categories of wires and cables are covered:<br />\r\n- communication
    and data wires and cables, which may have metal or optical fiber conductors;<br
    />\r\n- control and command wires and cables, which can have metal or fiber optical
    conductors;<br />\r\n- accessories.<br />\r\nThis document only deals with the
    \"wires and cables\" products. \"Accessories products are for further study. This
    document is primarily intended for:<br />\r\n- environment and/or product managers;<br
    />\r\n- LCA (life cycle assessment) experts in companies, in charge of PEP/PCR
    development;<br />\r\n- verifiers in charge of PEP/PCR conformity assessment in
    accordance with the defined rules."
