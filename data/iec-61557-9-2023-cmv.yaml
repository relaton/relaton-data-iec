  content: "IEC 61557-9:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61557-9:2023 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61557-9:2014
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 85 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61557-9:2023 specifies the requirements for the insulation
    fault location system (IFLS) that localizes insulation faults in any part of the
    system in unearthed IT AC systems and unearthed IT AC systems with galvanically
    connected DC circuits having nominal voltages up to 1 000 V AC, as well as in
    unearthed IT DC systems with voltages up to 1 500 V DC, independent of the measuring
    principle. IEC 61557-9:2023 cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) new terms and definitions on maximum admissible locating AC and DC currents
    and voltages;<br />\r\nb) the requirements on locating current and locating voltage
    have been revised;<br />\r\nc) performance requirements have been added;<br />\r\nd)
    the test requirements for locating current and locating voltage have been revised;<br
    />\r\ne) the structure of this document has been adapted to that of IEC 61557-1:2019;<br
    />\r\nf) the limit values under Clause A.2 were adapted to fit the changed test
    methods in 6.2.3."
