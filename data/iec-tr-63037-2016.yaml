  content: IEC TR 63037:2016(E) specifies the electrical interface between phase-cut
    dimming equipment and lighting equipment, such as LED integrated lamps and light
    sources with external controlgear, with the intention of helping designers of
    both types of equipment to develop  products that will work together properly.
    This document describes both the dimming phase and the off phase. In addition
    to the specification of the interface, test procedures are given for testing the
    proper operation. It may be expected that controlgear fulfilling the requirements
    of this document are also suited to be used with electronic switches that use
    a circuitry comparable with that of a phase-cut dimmer, but do not contain means
    for the adjustability of the phase-cut angle. Safety requirements are not covered
    by this document, but by respective product standards.
