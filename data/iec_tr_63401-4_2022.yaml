abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63401-4:2022 (E), which is a technical report, focuses on the fault
    behaviour of IBRs and performances of the existing relay protection in grids with
    large-scale integration of IBRs.<br />\r\nThis document includes:<br />\r\nThe
    IBR fault current requirements in present grid codes, including the requirements
    of active and reactive currents in positive- and negative-sequence systems during
    symmetrical and unsymmetrical faults.<br />\r\nFault current behaviour of IBRs,
    including the current components in transient and fundamental frequency in different
    IBR topology and control schemes.<br />\r\nAdaptability of existing relay protection
    with the large-scale integration of IBRs, including the performances of distance
    protection, phase selector, directional relay and over-current protection."
