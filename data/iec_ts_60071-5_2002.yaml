abstract:
- content: Provides guidance on the procedures for insulation co-ordination of high-voltage
    direct current (HVDC) converter stations, without prescribing standardized insulation
    levels. Applies only for HVDC applications in high-voltage a.c. power systems
    and not for industrial conversion equipment. Principles and guidance given are
    for insulation co-ordination purposes only. The requirements for human safety
    are not covered.
