abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003 establishes a framework for verifying the statements
    of an FSM Method and/or for conducting tests requested by the verification sponsor,
    relative to the following performance properties:<UL><LI>repeatability and reproducibility;</LI><LI>accuracy;</LI><LI>convertibility;</LI><LI>discrimination
    threshold;</LI><LI>applicability to Functional Domains.</LI></UL>NOTE Statements
    and test requests relative to other performance properties are outside the scope
    of ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003.ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003 aims to ensure that the output
    from the verification is objective, impartial, consistent and repeatable.The verification
    report, produced as a result of applying ISO/IEC TR 14143-3:2003, will enable
    the prospective user to select the FSM Method which best meets their needs.
