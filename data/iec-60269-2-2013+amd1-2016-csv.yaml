  content: "IEC 60269-2:2013+AMD1:2016 provides supplementary requirements for fuses
    for use by authorized persons and are generally designed to be used in installations
    where the fuse-links are accessible to, and may be replaced by, authorized persons
    only. Fuses for use by authorized persons according to the following fuse systems
    also comply with the requirements of the corresponding subclauses of IEC 60269-1,
    unless otherwise defined in this standard. This standard is divided into fuse
    systems, each dealing with a specific example of standardized fuses for use by
    authorized persons:<br />\r\n- Fuse system A: Fuses with fuse-links with blade
    contacts (NH fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system B: Fuses with striker fuse-links
    with blade contacts (NH fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system C: Fuse-rails (NH
    fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system D: Fuse-bases for busbar mounting (NH fuse
    system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system E: Fuses with fuse-links for bolted connections
    (BS bolted fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system F: Fuses with fuse-links having
    cylindrical contact caps (NF cylindrical fuse system),<br />\r\n- Fuse system
    G: Fuses with fuse-links with offset blade contacts (BS clip-in fuse system),<br
    />\r\n- Fuse system H: Fuses with fuse-links having \"gD\" and \"gN\" characteristic
    (class J and class time delay and non time delay fuse types),<br />\r\n- Fuse
    system I: gU fuse-links with wedge tightening contacts,<br />\r\n- Fuse system
    J: Fuses with fuse-links having \"gD class CC\" and \"gN class CC\" characteristics
    (class CC time delay and non-time delay fuse types),<br />\r\n- Fuse system K:
    gK fuse-links with blade for bolted connections - High fuse-link ratings from
    1 250 A up to 4 800 A (master fuse-links). This fifth edition of IEC 60269-2 cancels
    and replaces the fourth edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n1. fuse systems A and B:
    modified values for the power dissipation of NH aM fuse-links;<br />\r\n2. fuse
    systems A and B: introduction of dimension r for NH fuse-links;<br />\r\n3. addition
    of new fuse system K: gK fuse-links with contacts for bolted connections. Key
    Words: fuse systems A to K, requirements for fuses<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis publication
    is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/1234\">IEC
    60269-1:2006</a>.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis consolidated version consists of the
    fifth edition (2013)) and its amendment 1 (2016)."
