  content: IEC/TS 62647-23:2013(E) provides technical background, procurement guidance,
    engineering procedures, and guidelines to assist organizations reworking/repairing
    aerospace and high performance electronic systems, whether they were assembled
    or previously reworked/repaired using traditional alloys such as Sn-Pb or Pb-free
    alloys, or a combination of both solders and surface finishes. This document contains
    a review of known impacts and issues, processes for rework/repair, focused to
    provide the technical structure to allow the repair technician to execute the
    task. This document focuses on the removal and replacement of piece parts. The
    information contained within this document is based on the current knowledge of
    the industry at the time of publication.
