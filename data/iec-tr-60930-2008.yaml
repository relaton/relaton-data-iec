  content: IEC&#x2F;TR 60930:2008(E) is intended to lessen the risk to patients, operators,
    and their surroundings by providing a code of safe application. This reduction
    of risk is in addition to that brought about by the risk control measures incorporated
    in the medical electrical equipment, the medical electrical system, and the electrical
    installation in medical locations, hereafter referred to as me equipment, me system
    and installation respectively. Not all existing me equipment, me systems or installations
    meet the requirements of the relevant IEC standards. From time to time, operators
    and responsible organizations will encounter me equipment and me systems complying
    with older safety standards. However, the guidelines for safe application given
    in this technical report should nevertheless be followed in so far as this is
    possible. The guidelines in this technical report can be used with me equipment
    or me systems for the home healthcare environment provided the manufacturer has
    included home use in the intended use or the clinical engineering department has
    checked that the electrical installation and the physical environment will not
    result in any unacceptable risks. These guidelines can also be applied to equipment
    used for compensation or alleviation of disease, injury or disability. If the
    me equipment, an me system or the installation does not comply with the relevant
    IEC standards, the responsible organization should consult with the clinical engineering
    department or the manufacturer for instructions on how to achieve an adequate
    level of safety. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 1988. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition has been
    aligned with IEC 60601-1:2005, IEC 60601-1-2:2007, IEC 60601-1-8:2006 and IEC
    62353:2007. This edition includes medical electrical systems within its scope.
