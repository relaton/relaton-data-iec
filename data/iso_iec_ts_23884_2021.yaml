- content: "<p>This document specifies:</p><p>— physical and material parameters of
    virtual or real objects expressed to support comprehensive haptic rendering methods,
    such as stiffness, friction and micro-textures;</p><p>— a flexible specification
    of the haptic rendering algorithm itself.</p><p>It supplements other standards
    that describe scene or content description and information models for virtual
    and mixed reality, such as ISO/IEC 19775 and ISO/IEC 3721-1.</p>"
