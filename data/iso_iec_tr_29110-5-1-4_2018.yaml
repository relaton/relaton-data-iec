abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are
    enterprises, organisations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The
    life cycle processes described in the set of International Standards (IS) and
    Technical Reports (TR) are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by
    organisations bigger than VSEs.</p><p>The Advanced profile is the fourth profile
    of a four-profile software engineering roadmap (i.e. Entry, Basic, Intermediate
    and Advanced). This document describes processes targeted at VSEs that want to
    sustain and grow as an independent competitive software development business.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    29110-4-1 identifies the requirements applicable to the tasks and work products
    described in this document.</p><p>These guidelines apply to VSEs that develop
    non-critical software.</p><p>Using these guidelines, VSEs can obtain the following
    benefits:</p><p>- management and monitoring of more than one project in parallel
    with more than one work team;</p><p>- reuse of existing software components (e.g.
    code and document) in new projects;</p><p>- continuous measurement and evaluation
    of projects;</p><p>- continuous evaluation and improvement processes;</p><p>-
    continuous sustainability and growth; and</p><p>- support to customers in the
    disposal of software and installation of new software.</p><p>Once the software,
    developed by a VSE, has been accepted by their customer, the VSE that wants to
    provide after-delivery services can refer to ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3.</p>"
