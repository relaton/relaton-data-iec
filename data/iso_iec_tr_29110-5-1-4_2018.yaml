abstract:
- content: "This document is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises,
    organisations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The life cycle
    processes described in the set of International Standards (IS) and Technical Reports
    (TR) are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by organisations bigger
    than VSEs.<br />\r\nThe Advanced profile is the fourth profile of a four-profile
    software engineering roadmap (i.e. Entry, Basic, Intermediate and Advanced). This
    document describes processes targeted at VSEs that want to sustain and grow as
    an independent competitive software development business.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 29110-4-1
    identifies the requirements applicable to the tasks and work products described
    in this document.<br />\r\nThese guidelines apply to VSEs that develop non-critical
    software.<br />\r\nUsing these guidelines, VSEs can obtain the following benefits:<br
    />\r\n- management and monitoring of more than one project in parallel with more
    than one work team;<br />\r\n- reuse of existing software components (e.g. code
    and document) in new projects;<br />\r\n- continuous measurement and evaluation
    of projects;<br />\r\n- continuous evaluation and improvement processes;<br />\r\n-
    continuous sustainability and growth; and<br />\r\n- support to customers in the
    disposal of software and installation of new software.<br />\r\nOnce the software,
    developed by a VSE, has been accepted by their customer, the VSE that wants to
    provide after-delivery services can refer to ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3."
