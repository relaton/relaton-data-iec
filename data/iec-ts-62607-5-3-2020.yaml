  content: IEC TS 62607-5-3:2020 specifies sample structures for evaluating a wide
    range of charge carrier concentration in organic/nano materials. This specification
    is provided for both capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements in metal/insulator/semiconductor
    stacking structures and Hall-effect measurements with the van der Pauw configuration.
    Criteria for choosing measurement methods of charge carrier concentration in organic
    semiconductor layers are also given in this document.
