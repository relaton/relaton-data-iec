abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19795-1:2006 is concerned with the evaluation of biometric
    systems in terms of error rates and throughput rates. Metrics for the various
    error rates in biometric enrolment, verification and identification are unambiguously
    specified. Recommendations and requirements are given for the conduct of performance
    evaluations through the steps of planning the evaluation; collection of enrolment,
    verification or identification transaction data; analysis of error rates; and
    the reporting and presentation of results. The principles presented are generic
    to the range of biometric modalities, applications, and test purposes, and to
    both offline and online testing methodologies. These principles help avoid bias
    due to inappropriate data collection or analytic procedures; give better estimates
    of field performance for the expended effort; and clarify the limits of applicability
    of the test results.</p>"
