abstract:
- content: "IEC 62351-100-3:2020, which is a technical specification, describes test
    cases of data and communication security for telecontrol equipment, Substation
    Automation Systems [SAS] and telecontrol systems, including front-end functions
    of SCADA.<br />\r\nThe goal of this document is to enable interoperability by
    providing a standard method of testing protocol implementations to verify that
    a device fulfils the requirement of IEC 62351-3. Note that conformity to IEC 62351-3
    does not guarantee interoperability between devices using different implementations.
    It is expected that using this specification during testing will minimize the
    risk of non-interoperability. A basic condition for this interoperability is a
    passed conformance test of both devices.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document is
    the specification of common available procedures and definitions for conformance
    and/or interoperability testing to ensure conformity to IEC 62351-3. The conformance
    test cases defined here are focused to verify the conformant integration of the
    underlying authentication/encryption protocol (TLS), as specified in IEC 62351-3,
    to protect TCP/IP based communications.<br />\r\nThis document is not intended
    to test the underlying authentication/encryption protocol required by IEC 62351-3
    to be implemented over TCP/IP (TLS). The conformance testing of the authentication/encryption
    protocol over TCP/IP is outside the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document
    deals with data and communication security conformance testing; therefore, other
    requirements, such as safety or EMC are not covered. These requirements are covered
    by other standards (if applicable) and the proof of compliance for these topics
    is done according to these standards."
