    <p>This document defines physical characteristics and test methods for cards with devices, including but not limited to, power supplying devices, displays, sensors, microphones, loudspeakers, buttons or keypads. This document also covers aspects of coexistence of technologies of devices on the card and other machine-readable card technologies.</p>
    <p>Additional requirements related to biometric capture devices are defined in ISO/IEC 17839-2. Such requirements can be applied in addition to the ones defined in this document. ISO/IEC 17839-2 defines a type S2 card; the physical dimensions of the type S2 card are specified in Annex A.</p>
