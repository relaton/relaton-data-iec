  content: "IEC 62565-5-2:2022(E) which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a blank detail specification that lists the relevant key control characteristics
    (KCC) including chemical, physical, structural, and electrochemical characteristics
    of nano-enabled electrode for electrochemical capacitors. Electrodes of both electric
    double layer capacitors and pseudo capacitors with nano/ nanostructured materials
    such as nanoporous activated carbon, graphene, carbon nanotube, carbon black,
    carbon aerogel, carbon nanomaterial coating collector, etc., are included. For
    other electrodes, this document can be used for reference.<br />\r\nIn addition,
    this document enables the customer to specify requirements in a standardized manner
    and to verify through standardized methods that the nano-enabled electrode of
    the electrochemical capacitors meets the required properties."
