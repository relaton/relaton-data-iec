abstract:
- content: "IEC 61204-7:2016 EXV includes the provisions of the general rules dealt
    with in IEC 62477-1:2012. The Extended version is not an official IEC Standard.
    Only the current versions of the related standards are to be considered the official
    documents. The Extended version is available in English only.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    61204-7:2016 specifies the safety requirements for switch mode power supply (SMPS)
    units supplied by source voltages up to 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC providing AC
    and/or DC output(s), except inverter output(s) establishing AC mains. This product
    standard covers both stand-alone and component SMPS as defined in this document.
    DC power and distribution equipment which provides, distributes, monitors, and
    controls isolated secondary circuit power to other equipment typically used in
    information and communication technology equipment installations. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) use of IEC 62477-1 as reference document, instead of IEC
    60950-1;<br />\r\nb) modification of the title by deleting the wording \"DC output-\"
    and adding \"switch mode\"."
