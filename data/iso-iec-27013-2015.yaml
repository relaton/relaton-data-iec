    <p>ISO/IEC 27013:2015 provides guidance on the integrated implementation of ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 for those organizations that are intending to either</p>
    <p>a)    implement ISO/IEC 27001 when ISO/IEC 20000‑1 is already implemented, or vice versa,</p>
    <p>b)    implement both ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 together, or</p>
    <p>c)    integrate existing management systems based on ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 27013:2015 focuses exclusively on the integrated implementation of an information security management system (ISMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 27001 and a service management system (SMS) as specified in ISO/IEC 20000‑1.</p>
    <p>In practice, ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 20000‑1 can also be integrated with other management system standards, such as ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.</p>
