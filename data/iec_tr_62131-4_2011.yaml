abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62131-4:2011(E) reviews the available dynamic data relating to electrotechnical
    equipment transported by road vehicles. The intent is that from all the available
    data an environmental description will be generated and compared to that set out
    in IEC 60721. For each of the sources identified the quality of the data is reviewed
    and checked for self consistency. The process used to undertake this check of
    data quality and that used to intrinsically categorize the various data sources
    is set out in IEC/TR 62131-1.
