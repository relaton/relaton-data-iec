abstract:
- content: "IEC 60384-22:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60384-22:2024 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60384-22:2019
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 40 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60384-22:2024 is applicable to fixed unencapsulated surface mount
    multilayer capacitors of ceramic dielectric, Class 2, for use in electronic equipment.
    These capacitors have metallized connecting pads or soldering strips and are intended
    to be mounted on printed boards, or directly onto substrates for hybrid circuits.<br
    />\r\nCapacitors for electromagnetic interference suppression are not included
    but are covered by IEC 60384-14. The object of this document is to specify preferred
    ratings and characteristics and to select from IEC 60384-1:2021 the appropriate
    quality assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and to give general
    performance requirements for this type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements
    specified in detail specifications referring to this sectional specification provide
    specific test severities and requirements of an equal or higher performance level.
    Further information on the conception of generic, sectional and detail specifications
    can be found in the Introduction of IEC 60384-1:2021.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) The document has been completely restructured to comply with the ISO/IEC
    Directives, Part 2 and to make it more useable; tables, figures and references
    have been revised accordingly.<br />\r\nb) The requirements of reference temperature
    25 °C has been added in Table 5, Table 9, Table 10, Table 12, Table 14 and Table
    17.<br />\r\nc) The table of temperature characteristics of capacitance for the
    reference temperature 25 °C have been added in Table C.1, Table C.2 and Table
    C.3.<br />\r\nd) The requirement in 5.5.2 (visual examination) has been repeated
    in 5.9.3, 5.10.6, 5.11.4, 5.12.6, 5.13.8, 5.14.6 and 5.15.6.<br />\r\ne) The deflection
    D in the very robust designs has been added in 5.9.1.<br />\r\nf) Annex C has
    been changed informative into normative.<br />\r\ng) Clause D.5 (Test schedule
    for quality conformance inspection) has been newly added to withdraw the blank
    detail specification: IEC 60384-22-1."
