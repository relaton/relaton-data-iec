abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62899-402-4:2021(E), which is a Technical Report, is a preparatory
    work for the documents dealing with the measurement method of the vertical direction
    (surface forms) of printed patterns made by printed electronics technology.<br
    />\r\nThe printed pattern of interest in this document is limited to straight
    lines on substrates with a flat surface. This document focuses on the classification
    and measurement methods for surface forms from the nanometer scale to the micrometer
    scale, and suggests the strategy for the subsequent documents."
