    <p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016 specifies services provided in the Microsoft Windows platform to enable assistive technologies (AT) to interact with other software. One goal of this part of ISO/IEC 13066 is to define a set of application programming interfaces (APIs) for allowing software applications to enable accessible technologies on the Microsoft Windows platform. Another goal of this part of ISO/IEC 13066 is to facilitate extensibility and interoperability by enabling implementations by multiple vendors on multiple platforms.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 13066-2:2016 is applicable to the broad range of ergonomics and how ergonomics apply to human interaction with software systems.</p>
