    This part of IEC 61788 covers a test method detailing the tensile test procedures to be carried out on Cu/Nb-Ti superconductive composite wires at room temperature. This test is used to measure modulus of elasticity, 0,2 % proof strength of the composite due to yielding of the copper component, and tensile strength. The value for percentage elongation after fracture and the second type of 0,2 % proof strength due to yielding of the Nb-Ti component serves only as a reference (see Clauses A.1 and A.2). The sample covered by this test procedure has a round or rectangular cross-section with an area of 0,15 mm<sup>2</sup> to 2 mm<sup>2</sup> and a copper to superconductor volume ratio of 1,0 to 8,0 and without the insulating coating.

    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2000. It constitutes a technical revision.

    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    - the minimum distance between grips was changed from 100 mm to 60 mm;<br />
    - accuracy and precision statement were converted to uncertainty statements.
