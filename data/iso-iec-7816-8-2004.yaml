    <p>ISO/IEC 7816-8:2004 specifies interindustry commands for integrated circuit cards (either with contacts or without contacts) that may be used for cryptographic operations. These commands are complementary to and based on the commands listed in ISO/IEC 7816-4.</p>
    <p>Annexes are provided that give examples of operations related to digital signatures, certificates and the import and export of asymmetric keys.</p>
    <p>The choice and conditions of use of cryptographic mechanisms may affect card exportability. The evaluation of the suitability of algorithms and protocols is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 7816-8.</p>
