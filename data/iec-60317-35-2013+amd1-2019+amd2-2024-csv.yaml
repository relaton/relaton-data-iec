  content: "IEC 60317-35:2013+AMD1:2019+AMD2:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of
    solderable enamelled round copper winding wire of class 155 with a dual coating.
    The underlying coating is based on poly-urethane resin, which may be modified
    providing it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all
    specified wire requirements. The superimposed coating is a bonding layer based
    on a thermoplastic resin.<br />\r\nNOTE - A modified resin is a resin that has
    undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives to enhance certain
    performance or application characteristics. The range of nominal conductor diameters
    covered by this standard is:<br />\r\n- Grade 1B: 0,020 mm up to and including
    0,800 mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2B: 0,020 mm up to and including 0,800 mm. The nominal
    conductor diameters are specified in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1992, Amendment 1:1997
    and Amendment 2:1999. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new 3.2.2 containing general notes on winding wire, formerly
    a part of the scope;<br />\r\n- revision to references to IEC 60317-0-1:2013 to
    clarify that their application is normative;<br />\r\n- modification to Clause
    15 to remove specific wire specimen sizes;<br />\r\n- consolidation of 17.1 and
    17.2 of the solderability requirements;<br />\r\n- new Clause 23, Pin hole test.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nKey words: requirements of solderable enamelled round copper winding
    wire, class 155, dual coating"
