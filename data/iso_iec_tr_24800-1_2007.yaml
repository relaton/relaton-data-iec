abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24800-1:2007 specifies a framework for interoperability
    for still image search and retrieval and identifies an architecture and the components
    in this framework, the linkages between components, and which of these components
    and links are to be standardized in ISO/IEC 24800.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 24800-1:2007
    specifies the following:</p><ul><li>Definitions of terms and abbreviations.</li><li>A
    review of traditional approaches to image search and from various examples, motivates
    the importance of the user in the search process, the importance of making explicit
    the user task and user evaluation, and that meaning in images may be as much added
    from outside as extracted from the image itself.</li><li>Real use cases of the
    various ways searching take place. In particular, there could be multiple entry
    points into the overall search framework. These include automatic, semi-automatic,
    and human (user) driven searches.</li><li>A description of the overall search
    and management process. This can be considered the requirements specifications
    for a general search and management architecture.</li><li>A 4-layer architecture
    for ISO/IEC 24800 and explicitly identifies the components in the architecture,
    and their roles and positions in the architecture.</li><li>The overall structure
    of ISO/IEC 24800 and the purpose of the subsequent sub-parts:<ul><li>ISO/IEC 24800-2:
    Schema and ontology registration and identification</li><li>ISO/IEC 24800-3: ISO/IEC
    24800 query format</li><li>ISO/IEC 24800-4: Metadata embedded in image data (JPEG-1
    and JPEG-2000) file format</li><li>ISO/IEC 24800-5: Data interchange format between
    image repositories</li></ul></li></ul>"
