  content: "IEC 60092-353:2024 is applicable to shipboard and offshore non radial
    field power cables with extruded solid insulation, having a voltage rating of
    0,6/1 (1,2) kV or 1,8/3 (3,6) kV intended for fixed installations. Cables designed
    to maintain circuit integrity during a fire are included. The various types of
    power cables are given in 5.1. The constructional requirements and test methods
    are aligned with those indicated in IEC 60092-350, unless otherwise specified
    in this document.<br />\r\nThe object of this document is:<br />\r\n- to standardize
    cables whose safety and reliability is ensured when they are installed in accordance
    with the requirements of IEC 60092-352 or IEC 61892-4,<br />\r\n- to lay down
    standard manufacturing requirements and characteristics of such cables directly
    or indirectly bearing on safety, and<br />\r\n- to specify test methods for checking
    conformity with those requirements.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces
    the fourth edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Updated references to IEC 60092-350 for general
    construction and test methods and IEC 60092-360 for insulating and sheathing materials.<br
    />\r\nb) Added subclause 5.10: Construction for special applications.<br />\r\nc)
    Added Table 9: Additional test for cables for installation between areas with
    and without explosive atmospheres.<br />\r\nd) Deleted the test requirement IEC
    60331-21 from Table 7.<br />\r\ne) Deleted the former Annex A (Alternative enhanced
    insulation thickness for 0,6/1 kV)."
