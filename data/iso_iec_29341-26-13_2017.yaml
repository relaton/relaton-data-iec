abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29341-26-13:2017 specifies the PhoneManagement profile of the
    ConfigurationManagement Service defined in [7].</p><p>The PhoneManagement profile
    can be used for managing the configuration of the UPnP TelephonyServer device
    (i.e. a telephone), with tasks such as managing an address book, configuring the
    settings of the phone, configuring the ringing modes, checking the battery level
    of the phone. This profile is compliant with the UPnP Telephony Architecture defined
    in [9].</p><p>PhoneManagement defines</p><p>- A profile of the CMS in order to
    satisfy the requirements for PhoneManagement (see clause 5).</p><p>- The Phone
    Data Model to perform configuration management of the specific features of a phone
    (see Annex A) by reusing the CMS data model (see [7], Annex B).</p><p>The ConfigurationManagement
    service offers a general purpose data model and a set of configuration management
    operations for retrieving and managing the actual configuration parameters of
    a device. These features are completely reused from CMS in the PhoneManagement.</p><p>The
    ConfigurationManagement service defines the functions for manipulating the configuration
    and status parameters that are exposed by the device hosting the ConfigurationManagement
    service. These actions and state variables defined in the ConfigurationManagement
    service are reused in order to manage the configuration parameters of a TelephonyServer
    device for e.g. phone, defined in the data model of the PhoneManagement.</p><p>The
    main goal of this specification is to define the data model (called herein as
    Phone Data Model) for the TelephonyServer device like Phone, according to the
    rules defined by the ConfigurationManagement service for defining a new data model.</p><p>The
    Phone Data Model is organized as a hierarchical tree of parameter sets, where
    each set represent a feature of a TelephonyServer (e.g. address book, ringing
    modes etc) that can be managed by a TelCP.</p>"
