abstract:
- content: "IEC SRD 63416:2023 describes ethical considerations that are relevant
    when developing AAL systems and AAL services.<br />\r\nThis document covers AAL-specific
    issues related to AI that supplement those ethical considerations already addressed
    in other AI documents. Examples include the WHO and OECD principles of AI and
    those of the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the
    European Commission.<br />\r\nThis document analyses whether these frameworks
    for the governance of AI are sufficient to meet the requirements of the AAL environment
    and in particular to meet the needs of AAL care recipients.<br />\r\nThe objective
    of the ethical assessment is to create concrete and clear ethical guidelines that
    can be used as checklists in AAL service and system platform design, development
    and implementation."
