abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-204:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-204:2022
    applies to rigid HV gas‑insulated transmission lines (GIL) in which the insulation
    is obtained, at least partly, by an insulating gas or gas mixture other than air
    at atmos­pheric pressure, for alternating current of rated voltages above 52 kV,
    and for service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- update to be in line with IEC 62271-1:2017
    and alignment of the voltage ratings and the test voltages.<br />\r\n- addition
    of new information for welds on pressurized parts and gas tightness."
