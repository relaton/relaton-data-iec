  content: IEC 60747-5-11:2019(E) specifies the measuring methods of radiative and
    nonradiative currents of single light emitting diode (LED) chips or packages without
    phosphor. White LEDs for lighting applications are out of the scope of this document.
    This document utilizes the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) as a function of
    current, whose measurement methods are discussed in other documents.
