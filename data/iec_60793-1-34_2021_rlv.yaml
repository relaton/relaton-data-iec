abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-34:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-34:2021
    establishes uniform requirements for the mechanical characteristic: fibre curl
    or latent curvature in uncoated optical fibres, i.e. a specified length of the
    fibre has been stripped from coating. Fibre curl has been identified as an important
    parameter for minimizing the splice loss of optical fibres when using passive
    alignment fusion splicers or active alignment mass fusion splicers.Two methods
    are recognized for the measurement of fibre curl, in uncoated optical fibres:<br
    />\r\n- method A: side view microscopy;<br />\r\n- method B: laser beam scattering.<br
    />\r\nBoth methods measure the radius of curvature of an uncoated fibre by determining
    the amount of deflection that occurs as an unsupported fibre end is rotated about
    the fibre's axis. Method A uses visual or digital video methods to determine the
    deflection of the fibre while method B uses a line sensor to measure the maximum
    deflection of one laser beam relative to a reference laser beam. By measuring
    the deflection behaviour of the fibre as it is rotated about its axis and understanding
    the geometry of the measuring device, the fibre's radius of curvature can be calculated
    from simple circular models, the derivation of which are given in Annex C. Both
    methods are applicable to type B optical fibres as described in IEC 60793 (all
    parts). Method A is the reference test method, used to resolve disputes. This
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2006. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    modification of several derivation equations for laser scattering;<br />\r\n-
    change of angular increment from 10째 to 30째 to 10째 to 45째;<br />\r\n- change of
    Annex B from informative to normative."
