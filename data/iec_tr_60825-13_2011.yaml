abstract:
- content: "IEC 60825-13:2011 provides manufacturers, test houses, safety personnel,
    and others with practical guidance on methods to perform radiometric measurements
    or analyses to establish the emission level of laser energy in accordance with
    IEC 60825-1:2007. The measurement procedures described in this technical report
    are intended as guidance for classification of laser products in accordance with
    that standard. Other procedures are acceptable if they are better or more appropriate.
    Information is provided for calculating accessible emission limits (AELs) and
    maximum permissible exposures (MPEs), since some parameters used in calculating
    the limits are dependent upon other measured quantities. This document is intended
    to apply to lasers, including extended sources and laser arrays. Users of this
    document should be aware that the procedures described herein for extended source
    viewing conditions may yield more conservative results than when using more rigorous
    methods. This second edition brings minor changes and additions in the definitions,
    the classification flow has been updated, the apparent source sections have been
    clarified, the scanning has been updated, and more examples and useful conversions
    have been added to the annexes.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is to be read
    in conjunction with IEC 60825-1:2007."
