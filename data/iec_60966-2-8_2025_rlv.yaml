    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60966-2-8:2025
    is a detail specification that applies to cable assemblies with F-Quick connectors
    (see IEC 61169-47) and requires quad-shield screening class A++ (see IEC 61196-6-5).
    This document applies to the cable assemblies for radio and TV receivers. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2022. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    in item [5], drawing expanded by right angled connectors;<br />\r\nb) in item
    [12], female F-connectors cancelled (not standardized by IEC 61169-47);<br />\r\nc)
    in item [14] Reflection properties (return loss): different values for straight
    and right-angled connectors;<br />\r\nd) in item [14] Insertion loss: different
    factors for insertion loss calculation for straight and right-angled connectors;<br
    />\r\ne) in item [14] Loop resistance: loop resistance was set to 1 Ω max. value
    for the complete length."
