  content: ISO/IEC 29182-6:2014, describes and provides - a compilation of sensor
    network applications for which International Standardized Profiles (ISPs) are
    needed, - guidelines for the structured description of sensor network applications,
    and - examples for structured sensor network applications. It does not cover ISPs
    for which drafting rules are described in ISO/IEC TR 10000. Due to the generic
    character of ISO/IEC 29182, fully developed ISPs will not be included in this
    International Standard.
