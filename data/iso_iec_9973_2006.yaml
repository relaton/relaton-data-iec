abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9973:2006 specifies procedures to be followed in preparing,
    maintaining and publishing a register of identifiers and meanings for International
    Standards under the direction of ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 24.</p><p>Registration procedures
    do not assign values of identifiers that are defined as being workstation-dependent
    by specific graphics standards. The register of font appearance in the ISO/IEC
    JTC 1/SC 24 register for graphical items is not intended to address the broader
    issues of general-purpose font registration.</p>"
