abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62672:2018(E) applies to all line-commutated and voltage-sourced
    high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems used for power exchange
    in utility systems. The purpose of this document is to define a standardized reporting
    protocol so that data collected from different HVDC transmission systems can be
    compared on an equitable basis. This document covers point-to-point transmission
    systems, back-to-back interconnections and multi-terminal transmission systems.
