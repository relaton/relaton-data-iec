  content: "IEC 62841-1:2014+AMD1:2025 CSV deals with the safety of electric motor-operated
    or magnetically driven:<br />\r\n- hand-held tools (IEC 62841-2);<br />\r\n- transportable
    tools (IEC 62841-3);<br />\r\n- lawn and garden machinery (IEC 62841-4). The above
    listed categories are hereinafter referred to as \"tools\" or \"machines\". The
    rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools, and
    480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W. The
    limits for the applicability of this standard for battery tools are given in K.1
    and L.1. This standard deals with the hazards presented by tools which are encountered
    by all persons in the normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the tools.
    Tools with electric heating elements are within the scope of this standard. Hand-held
    electric tools, which can be mounted on a support or working stand for use as
    fixed tools without any alteration of the tool itself, are within the scope of
    this standard and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support is considered
    to be a transportable tool and thus covered by the relevant Part 3. This standard
    is scheduled to cancel and replace the fourth edition of IEC 60745-1, published
    in 2006, the first edition of IEC 61029-1, published in 1990, and the fifth edition
    of IEC 60335-1, published in 2010, only with respect to requirements concerning
    lawn and garden machinery. The latter publications remain valid until they are
    withdrawn. This standard constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the fourth edition
    of IEC 60745-1:<br />\r\n- requirements in various clauses introduced or modified
    in order to include the requirements for transportable tools and lawn and garden
    machinery (formerly covered by IEC 61029-1 and IEC 60335-1);<br />\r\n- leakage
    current test and electric strength test moved from former Clauses 13 and 15 to
    Annexes C and D;<br />\r\n- former Clauses 29, 30 and 31 renumbered to become
    Clauses 6, 13 and 15;<br />\r\n- requirements for electronic safety critical functions
    added to Clause 18;<br />\r\n- requirements for switches revised and moved from
    Annex I to Clause 23;<br />\r\n- clarifications in respect to soft materials (elastomers)
    added to Clauses 9, 19 and 13;<br />\r\n- test finger in Figure 1 of IEC 60745-1
    and test probe in Figure 2 of IEC 60745-1 replaced by references to basic IEC
    standards;<br />\r\n- requirements for Li-Ion battery systems added to Annexes
    K and L and Annex M was removed.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigenda of May
    2014 and of October 2015 have been included in this copy.<br />\r\nKey words:
    Tools, Electric-Motor-Operated, Hand held, Transportable, Lawn and Garden<br />\r\nThe
    content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-06) has been included in this copy."
