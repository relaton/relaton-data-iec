  content: "IEC 62522:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62552:2024
    provides a stable and reproducible procedure to calibrate the wavelength and power
    output of a tuneable laser against reference instrumentation such as optical power
    meters and optical wavelength meters (including optical frequency meters) that
    have been previously traceably calibrated."
