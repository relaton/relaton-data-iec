abstract:
- content: "IEC 60533:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60533:2015(E) specifies
    minimum requirements for emission, immunity and performance criteria regarding
    electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of electrical and electronic equipment for
    ships with metallic hull. This International Standard assists in meeting the relevant
    EMC requirements as stated in SOLAS 74, Chapter IV, Regulation 6 and Chapter V,
    Regulation 17. Reference to this International Standard is made in IMO Resolution
    A.813(19). This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Introduction has been supplemented;<br
    />\r\n- scope and title have been modified to limit the application of the standard
    to installations in ships with metallic hulls only;<br />\r\n- the normative references
    have been updated;<br />\r\n- further explanation for in-situ testing has been
    given in 5.1;<br />\r\n- numbering of CISPR-Standards in Tables 1, 2 and 3 has
    been updated;<br />\r\n- title of Annex B has been changed;<br />\r\n- requirements
    on cable routing in Annex B have been amended;<br />\r\n- new Annex C EMC test
    report has been added."
