  content: "There has been a surge in the digitalization and integration of renewable
    energy resources into electric power grids to enable efficient and intelligent
    energy management. However, existing power systems face increased vulnerabilities
    to challenges such as more frequent and severe weather conditions and evolving
    cyber attacks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis report establishes that making power grids
    smart by implementing advanced sensors and intelligent control systems is one
    of the answers for a more stable, reliable and resilient future of electric power
    grids.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt also notes that such a robust power grid with efficient
    monitoring is a crucial facilitator in realizing a cleaner future.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe report discusses the challenges and opportunities related to smart power
    grid sensing and looks at the immense potential of sensors in diverse applications
    like power generation, transmission and measurement of carbon emission.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIt further presents a vision of the future power grid architecture built
    upon smart sensors and potential technology roadmaps. Several key technologies
    have been emphasized, such as sensor placement optimization, sensor calibration,
    edge computing, AI data analysis, and cyber security.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally,
    the report analyzes the standardization efforts in this domain, which it deems
    vital in promoting the technologies’ widespread adoption.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis
    IEC societal and technology trend report was developed by the <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:47:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_LANG_ID:3261,25\">IEC
    Market Strategy Board</a> (MSB).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available
    for <a href=\"https://www.iec.ch/basecamp/smart-sensing-future-power-grids\">free
