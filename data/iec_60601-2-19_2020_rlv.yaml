abstract:
- content: "IEC 60601-2-19:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60601-2-19:2020
    applies to the BASIC SAFETY and ESSENTIAL PERFORMANCE of INFANT INCUBATORS, as
    defined in 201.3.209, also referred to as ME EQUIPMENT. If a clause or subclause
    is specifically intended to be applicable to ME EQUIPMENT only, or to ME SYSTEMS
    only, the title and content of that clause or subclause will say so. If that is
    not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to ME EQUIPMENT and to ME SYSTEMS,
    as relevant. HAZARDS inherent in the intended physiological function of ME EQUIPMENT
    or ME SYSTEMS within the scope of this document are not covered by specific requirements
    in this document, except in 7.2.13 and 8.4.1 of the general standard. IEC 60601-2-19:2020
    specifies safety requirements for INFANT INCUBATORS, but alternate methods of
    compliance with a specific clause, by demonstrating equivalent safety, will not
    be judged as non-compliant, if the MANUFACTURER has demonstrated in his RISK MANAGEMENT
    FILE that the RISK presented by the HAZARD has been found to be of an acceptable
    level when weighed against the benefit of treatment from the device.<br />\r\nIEC
    60601-2-19:2020 does not apply to:<br />\r\n- INFANT TRANSPORT INCUBATORS; for
    information, see IEC 60601-2-20;<br />\r\n- INFANT RADIANT WARMERS; for information,
    see IEC 60601-2-21;<br />\r\n- devices supplying heat via BLANKETS, PADS or MATTRESSES
    in medical use; for information, see IEC 60601-2-35;<br />\r\n- INFANT PHOTOTHERAPY
    EQUIPMENT; for information see IEC 60601-2-50.<br />\r\nSKIN TEMPERATURE SENSORS
    which are applied to operate a BABY CONTROLLED INCUBATOR including the displayed
    value are not considered to be a CLINICAL THERMOMETER in the sense of the particular
    standard ISO 80601-2-56. IEC 60601-2-19:2020 cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2009 and Amendment 1:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    IEC 60601-2-19:2020 includes the following significant technical change with respect
    to the previous edition: re-dating of normative references."
