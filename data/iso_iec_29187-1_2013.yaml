abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 29187-1:2013 has been developed to support modelling generic
    international requirements for identifying and providing privacy protection of
    personal information throughout any kind of ICT-based learning transaction where
    the individual has the role of an individual learner. It provides users and designers
    with a methodology and tools addressing privacy protection and related requirements
    imposed by applicable jurisdictional domains.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29187-1:2013 takes
    the "learning operational view" (LOV) aspects based on the ISO/IEC 14662 Open-edi
    Reference Model (a freely available ISO standard) together with applicable ISO
    standards including ISO/IEC 15944-1 and ISO/IEC 15944â€‘5 (also available without
    charge) as well as many other international referenced specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    29187-1:2013 models the requirements of jurisdictional domains as external constraints
    upon the creation, use, interchange, and information life cycle management of
    personal information. ISO/IEC 29187-1:2013 addresses the specified context of
    public policy requirements of jurisdictional domains controlling the use of personal
    information (PI). These include regulations for consumer protection, privacy protection,
    individual accessibility, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29187-1:2013 in a LET context identifies
    and expands upon eleven generic, primitive, international principles that have
    been associated with privacy protection requirements by international, regional,
    and UN member states. It models them with respect to the "collaboration space"
    of a learning transaction and commitment exchange involving an individual acting
    in the role of an individual learner. In a LET context, it provides principles
    and rules governing the establishment, management and use of identifiers of that
    individual, including the use of legally recognized names (LRNs), recognized individual
    identity (rii), and methods of non-identification, such as the use of anonymization
    and pseudonymization of personal information.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29187-1:2013 also
    sets out principles governing information lifecycle management (ILCM) as well
    as the rules and associated coded domains for obtaining informed consent for collection,
    specifying state changes, records retention, record deletion and related matters
    in support of privacy protection requirements.</p>
