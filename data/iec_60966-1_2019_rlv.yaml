abstract:
- content: "IEC 60966-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60966-1:2019 specifies
    requirements for radio frequency coaxial cable assemblies operating in the transverse
    electromagnetic mode (TEM) and establishes general requirements for testing the
    electrical, mechanical and environmental properties of radio frequency coaxial
    cable assemblies composed of cables and connectors. Additional requirements relating
    to specific families of cable assemblies are given in the relevant sectional specifications.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 1999.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) measurement method for screening effectiveness
    was cancelled;<br />\r\nb) give references to relevant test procedures for transfer
    impedance and screening attenuation<br /><br /></p>"
