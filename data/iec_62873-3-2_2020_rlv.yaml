abstract:
- content: "IEC 62873-3-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62873-3-2:2020 applies to
    devices equipped with flat quick-connect terminations consisting of a male tab
    with nominal width 6,3 mm and thickness 0,8 mm, to be used with a mating female
    connector for connecting electrical copper conductors according to the manufacturer's
    instructions, for rated currents up to and including 16 A. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Modification of the scope
    to address other devices in addition to RCDs;<br />\r\n- Modification of 8.1 so
    that IEC 62873-3-2 can be referred to by other product standards in addition to
    those for RCDs;<br />\r\n- Modification of 9.1 so that IEC 62873-3-2 can be referred
    to by other product standards in addition to those for RCDs.</p>"
