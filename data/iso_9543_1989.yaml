abstract:
- content: Prescribes quality requirements for serial data transmission at the interface
    between synchronous transmission Data Terminal Equipment and Data Circuit-terminating
    Equipment in conformance with the CCITT Recommendations V.24 (telephone networks),
    X.24 (data networks) as specified in DCEs of the corresponding CCITT-Recommendations.
    Takes into account the need to have performance cotegories of signal quality depending
    on the type of interchange circuits.
