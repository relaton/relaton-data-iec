abstract:
- content: "IEC 61482-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 61482-2:2018 is applicable
    to protective clothing used in work where there is the risk of exposure to an
    electric arc hazard. This document specifies requirements and test methods applicable
    to materials and garments for protective clothing for electrical workers against
    the thermal hazards of an electric arc. Electric shock hazard is not covered by
    this document, which is applicable in combination with standards covering such
    hazards. Other effects than the thermal effects of an electric arc like noise,
    light emissions, pressure rise, hot oil, electric shock, the consequences of physical
    and mental shock or toxic influences are not covered by this document. Protection
    of eyes, face, head, hands and feet against electric arc hazard is not covered
    by this document. Requirements and tests to cover electric arc hazards to these
    parts of the body are under development. Protective clothing for work intentionally
    using an electric arc, e.g. arc welding, plasma torch, is not covered by this
    document. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    new definition for ELIM, ATPV and EBT as used in accordance with IEC 61482-1-1:â€“;
    new requirements for the thermal stability of the intermediate layers; additional
    material requirement for volume resistance; new test procedure for the thermal
    resistance of sewing threads and a new symbol for marking.<br /><br />\r\nKey
