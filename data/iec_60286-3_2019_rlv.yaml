    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60286-3:2019 is applicable
    to the tape packaging of electronic components without leads or with lead stumps,
    intended to be connected to electronic circuits. It includes only those dimensions
    that are essential for the taping of components intended for the above-mentioned
    purposes. This document also includes requirements related to the packaging of
    singulated die products including bare die and bumped die (flip chips). This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- addition of a table of the classification to symbols concerning
    tape, reel and common symbols;<br />\r\n- additions of a figure of example of
    polarity and orientation and a figure of example of dot seal;<br />\r\n- revision
    of requirements for camber;<br />\r\n- addition of a definition of design value
    with regard to tilt.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"></ol>"
