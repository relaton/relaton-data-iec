  content: "IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR
    60601-4-3:2018 contains a series of recommendations developed by an expert working
    group of IEC subcommittee 62A in response to questions of interpretation of IEC
    60601-1:2005 and related collateral standards in the IEC 60601 series. IEC TR
    60601-4-3:2018 is primarily intended to be used by:<br />\r\n– manufacturers of
    medical electrical equipment;<br />\r\n– test laboratories and others responsible
    for assessment of compliance with IEC 60601 1:2005,  IEC 60601-1:2005/AMD1:2012,
    IEC 60601-1-8:2006, IEC 60601-1-8:2006/AMD1:2012, IEC 60601-1-11:2010, IEC 60601
    1 11:2015 and IEC 60601-1-12:2014;<br />\r\n– those developing subsequent editions
    of IEC 60601-1.<br />\r\nThe recommendations in the first edition of IEC TR 62296
    were considered in preparing the third edition of IEC 60601-1. Similarly, it is
    expected that these recommendations within IEC 60601-4-3 will be considered when
    preparing future revisions of IEC 60601-1 and related collateral standards in
    the IEC 60601 series. The object of IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 is to make the recommendations/interpretations
    available to those interested in the application of the third edition of IEC 60601-1
    and applicable collateral standards. IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 cancels and replaces
    the first edition of IEC 60601-4-3 published in 2015. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. IEC TR 60601-4-3:2018 includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition: addition of 47 new recommendations."
