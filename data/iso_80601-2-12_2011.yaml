abstract:
- content: 'ISO 80601-2-12:2011 applies to the basic safety and essential performance
    of a ventilator in combination with its accessories, hereafter referred to as
    me equipment: - intended to be attended by a professional operator for those patients
    who are dependent on mechanical ventilation; and - intended for use in critical
    care environments in a professional healthcare facility or intended for use in
    transport within a professional healthcare facility. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 is also
    applicable to those accessories intended by their manufacturer to be connected
    to a breathing system, or to a ventilator, where the characteristics of those
    accessories can affect the basic safety or essential performance of the ventilator.
    ISO 80601-2-12:2011 is not applicable to me equipment or an me system operating
    in ventilation modes intended for patients who are not dependent on mechanical
    ventilation. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 is not applicable to me equipment or an me system
    intended for those patients who are not dependent on mechanical ventilation. If
    a clause or subclause is specifically intended to be applicable to me equipment
    only, or to me systems only, the title and content of that clause or subclause
    will say so. If that is not the case, the clause or subclause applies both to
    me equipment and to me systems, as relevant. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 is not applicable
    to continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) me equipment, sleep apnoea therapy
    me equipment, home healthcare environment ventilators, ventilatory support me
    equipment, emergency and transport ventilators, anaesthetic ventilators, high-frequency
    jet ventilators (HFJVs) and high-frequency oscillatory ventilators (HFOVs). ISO
    80601-2-12:2011 does not specify the requirements for me equipment that is intended
    solely to augment the ventilation of spontaneously breathing patients within a
    professional healthcare facility. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 does not specify the requirements
    for ventilators or accessories intended for anaesthetic applications which are
    given in ISO 80601-2-13. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 does not specify the requirements
    for ventilators or accessories intended for home care ventilators for ventilator-dependent
    patients which are given in ISO 10651-2. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 does not specify
    the requirements for ventilators or accessories intended for emergency and transport
    which are given in ISO 10651-3. ISO 80601-2-12:2011 does not specify the requirements
    for ventilators or accessories intended for home-care ventilatory support devices
    which are given in ISO 10651-6.'
