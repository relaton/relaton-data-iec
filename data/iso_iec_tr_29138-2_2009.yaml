abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29138-2:2009 identifies a collection of documents (which
    it refers to as standards even though they encompass more than traditional ISO
    and ISO/IEC standards) that provides guidance on meeting the needs of people with
    disabilities. While its primary audience is standards developers, it can also
    be helpful for developers of information technology products and services, policy
    makers, procurers and for accessibility advocates to consider.</p><p>In addition
    to identifying user needs, ISO/IEC TR 29138-2:2009 identifies problems that people
    with disabilities experience with information technologies that lead to these
    user needs and identifies the relationship of these user needs with the accessibility
    factors for standards developers to consider found in ISO/IEC Guide 71:<em> Guidelines
    to address the needs of older persons and people with disabilities</em> when developing
    standards.</p>"
