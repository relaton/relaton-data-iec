abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 29138-2:2009 identifies a collection of documents (which it refers to as standards
    even though they encompass more than traditional ISO and ISO/IEC standards) that
    provides guidance on meeting the needs of people with disabilities. While its
    primary audience is standards developers, it can also be helpful for developers
    of information technology products and services, policy makers, procurers and
    for accessibility advocates to consider.<br />\r\nIn addition to identifying user
    needs, ISO/IEC TR 29138-2:2009 identifies problems that people with disabilities
    experience with information technologies that lead to these user needs and identifies
    the relationship of these user needs with the accessibility factors for standards
    developers to consider found in ISO/IEC Guide 71: Guidelines to address the needs
    of older persons and people with disabilities when developing standards."
