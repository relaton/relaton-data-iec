abstract:
- content: CISPR TR 16-4-6:2024 which is a Technical Report, applies to the acquisition,
    processing and preparation of statistical data of radio interference cases to
    facilitate the evaluation of the effectiveness of CISPR standards with respect
    to their potential to prevent radio frequency interference (RFI). This document
    also provides a method for the analysis and evaluation of the residual risk of
    occurrence of the incidence of RFI in the electromagnetic environment. This document
    also provides guidance for how an interested party can verify the root cause of
    RFI. This can be applied to either a reported RFI case or a case otherwise suspected
    of constituting an “RFI scenario”, by inspection and field strength measurements
    at the local site in the given electromagnetic environment. Acquisition of statistical
    data according to this document only encompasses RFI incidences which affect radio
    reception by radio receivers or respective receiver components.
