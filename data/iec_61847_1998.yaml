abstract:
- content: 'This standard specifies: - the essential non-thermal output characteristics
    of ultrasonic surgical units; - methods of measurement ot these output characteristics;
    - those characteristics which should be declared by the manufacturers of such
    equipment. This standard is applicable to equipment which meets the requirements
    of a, b and c below: a) ultrasonic surgical systems operating in the frequency
    range 20 kHz to 60 kHz; and b) ultrasonic surgical systems, whose use is the fragmentation
    or cutting of human tissue, whether or not those effects are delivered in conjunction
    with tissue removal or coagulation; and c) ultrasonic surgical systems, in which
    an acoustic wave is conducted by means of a specifically designed wave guide to
    deliver energy to the surgical site.'
