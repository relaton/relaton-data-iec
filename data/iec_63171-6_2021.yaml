    IEC 63171-6:2021 covers 2-way and 4-way (data/power), shielded, free and fixed connectors for data transmission with frequencies up to 600 MHz and specifies the common dimensions, mechanical, electrical and transmission characteristics and environmental requirements as well as test specifications.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    a) Mating conditions changed, see Figure 2, Figure 4, Figure 13, Figure 15, Figure 19 and Figure 21.
    b) Voltage proof requirement added, 2 250 V DC, see 5.7.2.
    c) Mechanical shock requirement added, see 5.7.6 (the requirement itself already was specified indirectly by Ed1 due to the specification of the test EP3 of Table 14 which is still identical to Ed1).
    d) Styles added, 6P-M8CI and 6J-M8CI, see Table 1.
