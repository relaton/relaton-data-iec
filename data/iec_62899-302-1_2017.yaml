abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-302-1:2017(E) specifies the method for determining inkjet drop
    speed based on visualized droplet images obtained by a drop analysis system. This
    measurement standardization is limited to drop-on-demand-type of inkjet and is
    not applicable to continuous inkjet. This document includes the test process,
    image processing software algorithm, and analysis of jetting behavior.
