  content: IEC 62893-2:2017(E) specifies test methods which are particular for cables
    with extruded insulation and sheath having a voltage rating of up to and including
    0,6/1 kV AC or up to and including 1 500 V DC for flexible applications under
    harsh conditions for the power supply between the electricity supply point or
    the charging station and the electric vehicle (EV).
