abstract:
- content: "IEC 61689:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61689:2022
    is applicable to ultrasonic equipment designed for physiotherapy containing an
    ultrasonic transducer generating continuous or quasi-continuous (e.g. tone burst)
    wave ultrasound in the frequency range 0,5 MHz to 5 MHz. This document only relates
    to ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment employing a single plane non-focusing circular
    transducer per treatment head, producing static beams perpendicular to the face
    of the treatment head. This document specifies:<br />\r\n- methods of measurement
    and characterization of the output of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based
    on reference testing methods;<br />\r\n- characteristics to be specified by manufacturers
    of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based on reference testing methods;<br />\r\n-
    guidelines for safety of the ultrasonic field generated by ultrasonic physiotherapy
    equipment;<br />\r\n- methods of measurement and characterization of the output
    of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment based on routine testing methods;<br />\r\n-
    acceptance criteria for aspects of the output of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment
    based on routine testing methods.<br />\r\nTherapeutic value and methods of use
    of ultrasonic physiotherapy equipment are not within the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nUltrasonic physiotherapy equipment using ultrasound in the frequency range
    from 20 kHz to 500 kHz is dealt with in IEC 63009.<br />\r\nIEC 61689:2022 cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) The requirement on water oxygen
    content is specified in 6.1.<br />\r\nb) Former recommendations in 6.2 have been
    changed to become requirements.<br />\r\nc) Several definitions in Clause 3 have
    been updated in line with other TC 87 documents.<br />\r\nd) The formerly informative
    Annex A has been changed to become normative, and now contains details on how
    conformance with IEC 60601-2-5 requirements is checked.<br />\r\ne) Annex D has
    been considerably shortened and reference to a now withdrawn regulatory document
    has been removed."
