abstract:
- content: This technical specification describes a method for characterizing the
    modal structure of a graded-index multimode (category A1) fibre. It is useful
    for assessing the bandwidth performance of a fibre used with laser sources. A
    probe spot is scanned across the fibre endface and the optical pulse delay is
    determined at specified offset positions. The difference in optical pulse delay
    time between fastest and slowest modes is the Differential Mode Delay.
