  content: "IEC 62153-4-4:2015(E) describes a test method to determine the screening
    attenuation as of metallic communication cable screens. Due to the concentric
    outer tube, measurements are independent of irregularities on the circumference
    and outer electromagnetic field. A wide dynamic frequency range can be applied
    to test even super-screened cables with normal instrumentation from low frequencies
    up to the limit of defined transversal waves in the outer circuit at approximately
    4 GHz. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in
    2006 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Impedance matching adapters are no longer required when measuring devices have
    a characteristic impedance different from the characteristic impedance of the
    test equipment;<br />\r\n- The reflection loss due to a mismatch is taken into
    account by a (calculated) correction factor."
