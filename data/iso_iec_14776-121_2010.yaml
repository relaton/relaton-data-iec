abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;EC 14776-121:2010(E) specifies the performance requirements of
    the interconnect and expands the coverage to the complete assembled interconnect
    including connectors, uniform bulk cable, and non-uniform bulk cable. A syntax
    and framework is described for all types of passive interconnect. The methodology
    for performing the electrical measurements required to determine compliance with
    the performance requirements for bulk cable of several types, various assembled
    interconnects and printed circuit board designs is included. Details of the measurement
    methodology are specified to minimize the difference in measured results from
    different electrical testing laboratories. Details include calibration, fixturing
    and sample preparation, equipment, measurement procedure and data output format.
