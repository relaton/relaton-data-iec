abstract:
- content: "IEC 62357-2:2019 (E), which is a technical report, establishes the list
    of Use Cases developed by TC 57, Power systems management and associated information
    exchanges, in order to prepare International Standards, Technical Reports and
    Technical Specifications. Use Cases are fundamental to TC 57 publications \r\n\r\n
    This Technical Report:<br />\r\n• Identifies in existing standards, technical
    specification, reports and in ongoing TC 57 work (CD, DTS, DTR etc.) the Use Cases
    used as well as their links to standards, their status as Use Cases (level of
    description, standardization of the description referring to IEC 62559) and as
    IEC deliverables (are they in a TR/TS/IS, what is the status of the document CD,
    CDV etc.)<br />\r\n• Helps System Committees consolidate Use Cases through terminology
    and term definition work (link with existing relevant standards on the TC Terminology)
    and building links between roles and modelling frameworks (Role models). For example
    in TC 57 building links between the Use Case methodology and the roles used in
    IEC 62913-2 with CIM Interface Reference Model (IRM – IEC 61968).<br />\r\n• Shares
    and promotes those Use Cases within TC 57 and outside it. TC 57 mainly describes
    System Use Cases in the standards it publishes. Business roles and business Use
    Cases are mainly described within SyC SE (System Committee Smart Energy) deliverables
    (IEC 62559 series and IEC 62913 series).<br />\r\n• This document provides good
    input in reusing System Use Cases and System Roles inside and outside TC 57.<br
    />\r\n• Explains the content of its Use Cases to potential users and providing
    support on using those Use Cases for standardization (Normative context, maturity
    of the Use Case, location in standardization work, roles implied)<br />\r\nThose
    Use Cases aimed to be used as tools to identify requirements as input to further
    development of technical standards (whether TC 57 or not) and improve the consistency
    in this work and in that way contribute to interoperability. Use Cases facilitate
    cooperation at a system level with TCs, other standards-developing organizations,
    non-traditional players of electrotechnology, and regional organizations. Inside
    the IEC they provide a convergence platform with overall system level value for
    support of the Technical Committees and other standard development groups.<br
    />\r\nThis document allows TC 57 to self-assess its work on Use Cases through
    KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) such as:<br />\r\n• % of Use Cases compliant
    with IEC 62559-2<br />\r\n• % of Business Use Cases (BUC) and System Use Cases
    (SUC)<br />\r\n• % of Business Roles and System Roles"
