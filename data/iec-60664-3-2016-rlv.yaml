  content: "IEC 60664-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60664-3:2016 applies
    to assemblies protected against pollution by the use of coating, potting or moulding,
    thus allowing a reduction of clearance and creepage distances as described in
    IEC 60664-1. This document describes the requirements and test procedures for
    two methods of protection:<br />\r\n- type 1 protection improves the microenvironment
    of the parts under the protection;<br />\r\n- type 2 protection is considered
    to be similar to solid insulation. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) information
    added concerning interpolation;<br />\r\nb) provided scratch test is only for
    type 2 protection;<br />\r\nc) renumbered the scratch test to follow the visual
    examination test, since it makes more sense there;<br />\r\nd) separated the tables
    under what is now called Annex A, to make them clearer."
