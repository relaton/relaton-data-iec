abstract:
- content: IEC 61970-456:2013+A1:2015(E) defines the subset of classes, class attributes,
    and roles from the CIM necessary to describe the result of state estimation, power
    flow and other similar applications that produce a steady-state solution of a
    power network, under a set of use cases which are included informatively in this
    standard. This standard is intended for two distinct audiences, data producers
    and data recipients, and may be read from those two perspectives. From the standpoint
    of model export software used by a data producer, the standard describes how a
    producer may describe an instance of a network case in order to make it available
    to some other program. From the standpoint of a consumer, the standard describes
    what that importing software must be able to interpret in order to consume solution
    cases.<strong>This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2013) and
    its amendment 1 (2015). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
    publication.</strong>
