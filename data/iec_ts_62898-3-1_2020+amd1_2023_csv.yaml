abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62898-3-1:2020+AMD1:2023 provides guidelines for the specification
    of fault protection and dynamic control in microgrids. Protection and dynamic
    control in a microgrid are intended to ensure safe and stable operation of the
    microgrid under fault and disturbance conditions. This document applies to AC
    microgrids comprising single or three-phase networks or both. It includes both
    isolated microgrids and non-isolated microgrids with a single point of connection
    (POC) to the upstream distribution network. It does not apply to microgrids with
    two or more points of connection to the upstream distribution network, although
    such systems can follow the guidelines given in this document. This document applies
    to microgrids operating at LV or MV or both. DC and hybrid AC/DC microgrids are
    excluded from the scope, due to the particular characteristics of DC systems (extremely
    large fault currents and the absence of naturally occurring current zero crossings).
    This document defines the principles of protection and dynamic control for microgrids,
    general technical requirements, and specific technical requirements of fault protection
    and dynamic control. It addresses new challenges in microgrid protection requirements,
    transient disturbance control and dynamic disturbance control requirements for
    microgrids. It focuses on the differences between conventional power system protection
    and new possible solutions for microgrid protection functions. Depending on specific
    situations, additional or stricter requirements can be defined by the microgrid
    operator in coordination with the distribution system operator (DSO). This document
    does not cover protection and dynamic control of active distribution systems.
    This document does not cover product requirements for measuring relays and protection
    equipment. This document does not cover safety aspects in low voltage electrical
    installations, which are covered by IEC 60364 (all parts and amendments related
    to low-voltage electrical installations). Requirements relating to low voltage
    microgrids can be found in IEC 60364-8-2.
