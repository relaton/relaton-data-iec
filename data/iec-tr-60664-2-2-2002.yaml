  content: "IEC TR 60664-2-2:2002(E) Provides an overview of the different kinds of
    surge overvoltages that can occur on low-voltage installations and equipment.
    In particular:<br />\r\n- the magnitude and duration of typical surges as well
    as their frequency of occurrence;<br />\r\n- information on overvoltages resulting
    from interaction between power and communication systems;<br />\r\n- guidelines
    when considering interface issues in relation to insulation coordination;<br />\r\n-
    guidelines concerning surge protection means on the basis of availability and
    risk considerations, including interaction within the system;<br />\r\n- highlights
    temporary overvoltages and other factors that have to be taken into account for
    insulation coordination, primarily related to protective control using surge protective
    devices."
