abstract:
- content: "This document specifies how the format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 can
    be used to store web resources (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) and defines brands
    to identify files conforming to this document. It also specifies hypothetical
    processing for how these files can be consumed by web browsers.<br />\r\nThe specified
    storage enables the delivery of synchronized media and web resources as supported
    by ISO/IEC 14496-12: file download, progressive file download, streaming, broadcast,
    etc.<br />\r\nThis document also defines how to signal required web capabilities
    to process the files. This is done in a way that web profiles defined by other
    organizations can be signalled in a dedicated box, e.g. the MIME Box, similarly
    to how it is done in ISO/IEC 14496-30.<br />\r\nThis document does not define
    any profiles for web data, only their carriage."
