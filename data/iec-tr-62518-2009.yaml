  script: Latn
  content: IEC/TR 62518:2009(E) describes the temperature behaviour of rare earth
    sintered magnets in detail for use in designing magnetic circuits exposed to elevated
    temperatures. The temperature behaviour of SmCo<sub>5</sub>, Sm<sub>2</sub>Co<sub>17</sub>
    and Nd-Fe-B sintered magnets is described. The various changes of open circuit
    flux which can occur due to temperature are discussed in Clause 4. The long term
    stability of the magnets is discussed in Clause 5. The experimental procedures
    are described in Clause 6. Results of the measurements of the flux loss occurring
    at the ambient temperature after heating isothermally at 50 °C, 75 °C, 100 °C,
    125 °C, 150 °C and 200 °C for up to 1000 h are given in Clause 7. The effect of
    length to diameter ratio (L/D) of the magnet samples and the influence of <i>H</i><sub>cJ</sub>
    on the flux loss were also studied. The results are discussed in Clause 8. The
    data in this technical report was provided by the Institute of Electrical Engineers
    of Japan (IEEJ) and its subcommittees. This data has been gathered from the members
    of these sub-committees. The temperature stability correlated with the complex
    corrosion behaviour and the spin re-orientation phenomena at cryogenic temperatures
    will not be given in this technical report.
