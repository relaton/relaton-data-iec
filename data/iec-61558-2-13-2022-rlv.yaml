    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61558-2-13:2022
    deals with the safety of auto-transformers for general applications and power
    supply units incorporating auto-transformers for general applications. Transformers
    incorporating electronic circuits are also covered by this document. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2009. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- adjustment
    of structure and references in accordance with IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\n- description
    of constructions moved to IEC 61558-1:2017;<br />\r\n- new symbol for power supply
    unit with linearly regulated output voltage.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group
    safety publication in accordance with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/65358\">IEC
    Guide 104</a>.\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\"> </div>"
