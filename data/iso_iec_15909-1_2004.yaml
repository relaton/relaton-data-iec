abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15909-1:2004 defines a semi-graphical modelling language for the
    specification, design and analysis of discrete event systems, including software
    and in particular distributed and parallel systems where concurrency is an important
    characteristic. The technique, High-level Petri Nets, is mathematically defined
    and may thus be used to provide unambiguous specifications and descriptions of
    applications. The graphical nature of the technique allows information, or resource
    flow, and control flow to be visualised, providing a powerful aid to understanding
    system behaviour. It is also an executable technique, allowing specification prototypes
    to be developed to test ideas at the earliest and cheapest opportunity. Specifications
    written in the technique may be subjected to analysis methods to prove properties
    about the specifications, before implementation commences, thus saving on testing
    and maintenance time. The field of application encompasses a wide range of systems
    from technical systems such as manufacturing, business processes, computer software
    and hardware, telecommunication networks and signalling systems, defence systems,
    mechatronics, postal services and avionics to biological and sociotechnical systems.
