  content: "IEC TS 62607-8-3:2023 This part of IEC 62607, which is a Technical Specification,
    specifies a measurement protocol to determine the key control characteristics<br
    />\r\n- analogue resistance change, and<br />\r\n- resistance fluctuation<br />\r\nfor
    nano-enabled metal-oxide interfacial devices by<br />\r\n- electrical resistance
    measurement.<br />\r\nAnalogue resistance change as a function of applied voltage
    pulse is measured in metal-oxide interfacial devices. The linearity in the relationship
    of the variation of conductance and the pulse number is evaluated using the parameter
    fitting. The parameter of the resistance fluctuation is simultaneously computed
    in the fitting process.<br />\r\n- This method is applicable for evaluating computing
    devices composed of the metal-oxide interfacial device, for example, product-sum
    circuits, which record the learning process as the analogue resistance change."
