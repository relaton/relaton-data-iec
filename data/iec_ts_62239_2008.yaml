abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62239:2008(E) defines the requirements for developing an Electronic
    Components Management Plan (ECMP) to assure customers and regulatory agencies
    that all of the electronic components in the equipment of the plan owner are selected
    and applied in controlled processes compatible with the end application and that
    the technical requirements detailed in Clause 4 are accomplished. In general,
    the owners of a complete electronic components management plan are avionics equipment
    manufacturers. This new edition refers to publications that were recently issued.
