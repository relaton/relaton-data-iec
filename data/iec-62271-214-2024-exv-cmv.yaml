  content: "This pack contains IEC 62271-214:2024 EXV and IEC 62271-214:2024 CMV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62271-214:2024 specifies requirements for internal arc classification
    of AC metal-enclosed pole-mounted switchgear and controlgear with rated voltages
    above 1 kV and up to and including 52 kV with service frequencies up to and including
    60 Hz. This document is applicable to three-phase, two-phase and single-phase
    open terminal equipment for which an internal arc classification is assigned.
    Enclosures may include fixed and removable components and may be filled with fluid
    (liquid or gas) to provide insulation. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) indicators positioning update;<br />\r\nb)
    neutral earthing connection of the test circuit for three-phase tests;<br />\r\nc)
    general review for consistency with IEC 62271-200, Ed.3.0:2021.<br />\r\nThe content
    of the corrigendum 1 (2025-04) has been included in this copy."
