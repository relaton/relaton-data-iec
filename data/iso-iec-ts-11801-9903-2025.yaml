  content: "ISO/IEC TS 11801-9903:2025 establishes modelling of limits for mixed-mode
    transmission parameters within and between two pairs of balanced cabling. This
    document consists of a detailed description of matrix modelling and gives explanations
    on how to convert matrices, by using the S to T and T to S matrix conversion.
    Further it consists of terms and definitions used, how specific parameters are
    modelled, alternative calculation and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) modelling.<br
    />\r\nChain parameters and alternative approaches and formulas are described for
    combining component cable and connector transmission parameters into cabling link
    and channel transmission parameters. S-parameter limit matrix formulas are covered,
    which can be transformed into T-parameter limit matrices for use in chain parameter
    link and channel limit formulas. The formulas are applicable to all transmission
    parameters for forming complete differential-mode, mixed-mode, and common-mode
    link and channel models.<br />\r\nTerms and definitions used for modelling are
    discussed, together with how modelling is done for specific transmission parameters.
    Alternative calculation models are explained, and the SNR modelling introduced.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2021. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the expansion of the list of specified parameters to include mixed-mode
    mode-conversion and related unbalance attenuation parameters;<br />\r\nb) the
    addition of an informative annex covering the topic of signal-to-noise ratio and
    its relation to the S-parameter matrix channel model."
