abstract:
- content: determines the screening effectiveness of a shielded metallic communication
    cable by applying a well-defined current and voltage to the screen of the cable
    and measuring the induced voltage in order to determine the surface transfer impedance.
    Measurements in the frequency range from a few kHz up to and above 1 GHz can be
    made with the use of normal high frequency instrumentation.
