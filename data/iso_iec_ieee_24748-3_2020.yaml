abstract:
- content: "<p>This document is a guideline for the application of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.
    This document establishes guidance to implement a common framework for software
    life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology, that can be referenced by
    the software industry. This document provides guidance on defining, controlling,
    and improving software life cycle processes within an organization or a project.
    This document recommends methods and approaches suitable for a variety of life
    cycle models. The guidance emphasizes the importance of establishing a strategy,
    planning, and the involvement of stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving
    customer satisfaction.</p><p>This document applies to the acquisition, supply,
    design and development, transition, operation, maintenance, and disposal (whether
    performed internally or externally to an organization) of software systems, products,
    and services (including software as a service (SaaS)), and the software portion
    of any system. Software includes the software portion of firmware. The guidance
    on processes, activities, and tasks in this document can also be applied during
    the acquisition of a system that contains software. The guidance in this document
    can also be used as a basis for selecting, establishing, and improving organizational
    environments, e.g., methods, procedures, techniques, tools, and trained personnel.</p><p>In
    the context of this document, there is a continuum of human-made systems from
    those that use little or no software to those in which software is the primary
    interest. It is rare to encounter a complex system without software, and all software
    systems require physical system components (hardware) to operate, either as part
    of the software system-of-interest (SoI) or as an enabling system or infrastructure.
    Thus, the choice of whether to apply this document for guidance to the software
    life cycle processes, or ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-2, depends on the SoI. At a high level,
    both documents have the same life cycle process framework, but differ in guidance
    for activities and tasks to perform software engineering or systems engineering,
    respectively.</p><p>The processes and process groups in this document are identical
    in their purpose and outcomes with those in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15288:2015, with one exception: the System/Software Requirements Definition process
    of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 and this document has a different name from the System
    Requirements Definition process of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015.</p><p>Use of the guidance
    in this document is appropriate regardless of software system size or complexity
    or organizational size. The process outcomes from the ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017
    life cycle processes are meant to be generic and applicable to the engineering
    of any software system in any size organization.</p><p>This document does not
    prescribe nor detail a specific software life cycle model, development methodology,
    method, modelling approach, or technique and method. The variety of ways for implementing
    software (e.g., development of new code, integration of existing open source components
    and commercial products, or modifications to existing software, including transition
    to new platforms) make it impossible to detail specific procedures.</p><p>This
    document does not establish a management system or provide guidance on the use
    of any management system standard. However, it is intended to be compatible with
    the quality management system specified by ISO 9001, the service management system
    specified by ISO/IEC 20000-1, the IT asset management system specified by ISO/IEC
    19770 (all parts), and the information security management system specified by
    ISO/IEC 27000.</p><p>Clause 6 provides guidance on aspects of purposes, outcomes,
    activities, and tasks in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017. However, this document does
    not repeat the detailed requirements and recommendations for purposes, outcomes,
    activities, and tasks for each life cycle process found in ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017.
    Clause 6 also provides references to specialized standards that provide more detailed
    requirements and guidance for the various processes and information products (information
    items). This document does not detail information items (process inputs and outputs)
    in terms of name, format, explicit content and recording media.</p><p>NOTE ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15289 addresses the content for life cycle process information items (documentation).</p>"
