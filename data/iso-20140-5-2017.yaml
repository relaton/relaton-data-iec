  content: "ISO 20140-5:2017 specifies the types of environmental performance evaluation
    (EPE) data, including their attributes, which can be used for evaluating the environmental
    performance of manufacturing systems based on the general principles described
    in ISO 20140‑1. It also provides recommendations for mapping the EPE data on to
    information models specified by IEC 62264.<br />\r\nISO 20140-5:2017 applies to
    discrete, batch and continuous manufacturing.<br />\r\nISO 20140-5:2017 is applicable
    to entire manufacturing facilities and to parts of a manufacturing facility.<br
    />\r\nISO 20140-5:2017 specifically excludes from its scope the syntax of the
    data and information models, the protocols to exchange data models, the functions
    that can be enabled by data models, and the activities in Level 1 and Level 2.<br
    />\r\nThe scope of ISO 20140-5:2017 also includes indicating the differences among
    various data and information models and the differences among various representations
    of environmental performance by actual data.<br />\r\nISO 20140-5:2017 refers
    to the semantics of the structured data and information models used by communication
    protocols. The semantics explain the meaning of the attributes and of the context
    information.<br />\r\nThe following are outside the scope of ISO 20140-5:2017:<br
    />\r\n- product life cycle assessment;<br />\r\n- EPE data that are specific to
    a particular industry sector, manufacturer or machinery;<br />\r\n- acquisition
    of data;<br />\r\n- the activity of data communication."
