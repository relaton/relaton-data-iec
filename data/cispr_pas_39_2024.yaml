abstract:
- content: "CISPR PAS 39:2024, which is a Publicly available specification, is applicable
    to electrical and electronic equipment within the scope of IEC 61000-6-3:2020,
    for which no relevant dedicated product or product family EMC emission standard
    has been published. It defines low voltage AC mains conducted emission requirements
    in the frequency range 9 kHz to 150 kHz which are considered essential and have
    been selected to provide an adequate level of protection to both radio reception
    and Mains Communicating Systems (MCS) in the defined electromagnetic environment.
    The emission requirements in this document are not intended to be applicable to
    the intentional transmissions and their harmonics from a radio transmitter as
    defined by the ITU.<br />\r\nThis PAS complements IEC 61000-6-3:2020 by the addition
    of the following:<br />\r\n- addition of normative requirements for conducted
    emissions at the low voltage AC mains port in the frequency range 9 kHz to 150
    kHz;<br />\r\n- addition of an informative annex providing background information
    on the normative limits;<br />\r\n- addition of an informative annex with recommendations
    to limit the spectral density of nonâ€‘intentional emissions (NIE)."
