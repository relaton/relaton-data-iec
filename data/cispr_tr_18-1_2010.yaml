    CISPR 18-1:2010(E), which is a technical report, applies to radio noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment which may cause interference to radio reception. The scope of this publication includes the causes, measurement and effects of radio interference, design aspects in relation to this interference, methods and examples for establishing limits and prediction of tolerable levels of interference from high voltage overhead power lines and associated equipment, to the reception of radio broadcast services.
    The frequency range covered is 0,15 MHz to 300 MHz. Radio frequency interference caused by the pantograph of overhead railway traction systems is not considered in this technical report. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1982. It is a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    - while the first edition of CISPR 18-1 only covered the direct distance D0 for the establishment of standard profiles for the lateral radio noise field emanating from HV overhead power lines,<br />
    - this second edition now also allows for use of the lateral  distance y0 for these purposes. This way it allows for the establishment of standard profiles for the lateral radio noise field also from modern HV overhead power line constructions with tall suspension towers.
