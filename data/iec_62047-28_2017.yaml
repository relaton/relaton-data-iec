abstract:
- content: "IEC 62047-28:2017(E) specifies terms and definitions, and a performance
    testing method of vibration driven MEMS electret energy harvesting devices to
    determine the characteristic parameters for consumer, industry or any application.<br
    />\r\nThis document applies to vibration driven electret energy harvesting devices
    whose electrodes with a gap below 1 000 Î¼m are covered by dielectric material
    with trapped charges and are fabricated by MEMS processes such as etching, photolithography
    or deposition."
