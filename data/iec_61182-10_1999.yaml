abstract:
- content: Specifies data file formats used to describe printed boards and printed
    board assembly products for tooling, manufacturing, assembly, and testing requirements.
    Useful when the manufacturing cycle includes computer-aided processes and numerically
    controlled machines, these formats may be used for transmitting information between
    a printed board designer and a manufacturing or assembly facility.
