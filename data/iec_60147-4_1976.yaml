abstract:
- content: |-
    Gives conditions for electrical tests, for different temperature conditions and for different durations, as well as failure-defining characteristics and failure criteria, which are standardized for each device category. This permits a unique and easy comparison of data presented by different manufacturers, relative to acceptance testing as well as to reliability testing.
    Deals with semiconductor devices and digital integrated circuits (bipolar, MOS, multi-chip and hybrid circuits).
