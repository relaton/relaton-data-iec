  content: "IEC 61935-2-22:2021 is a blank detail specification describing cords which
    are compliant with category 6 cabling requirements, as specified in the ISO/IEC
    11801-1<em>.</em><br />\r\nISO/IEC 11801 and ISO/IEC 11801 series definitions
    and specifications referenced by this blank detail specification are currently
    covered by ISO/IEC 11801-1.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 61935-2, IEC 61156-1, IEC 61156-6, IEC 60603-7-41 and IEC 60603-7-51.
    The blank detail specification determines the layout and style for detail specifications
    describing cords with transmission characteristics up to 500 MHz for digital communications.
    Detail specifications, based on the blank detail specification, can be prepared
    by a national organization, a manufacturer, or a user.<br />\r\nTest configuration
    applicable to cords is detailed in the IEC 61935-2."
