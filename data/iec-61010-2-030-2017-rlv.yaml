  content: "IEC 61010-2-030:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-030:2017
    This group safety publication is primarily intended to be used as a product safety
    standard for the products mentioned in the scope, but shall also be used by technical
    committees in the preparation of their publications for products similar to those
    mentioned in the scope of this standard, in accordance with the principles laid
    down in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nIEC 61010-2-030:2017 specifies
    safety requirements for equipment having testing or measuring circuits which are
    connected for test or measurement purposes to devices or circuits outside the
    measurement equipment itself.<br />\r\nThese include measuring circuits which
    are part of electrical test and measurement equipment, laboratory equipment, or
    process control equipment. The existence of these circuits in equipment requires
    additional protective means between the circuit and an OPERATOR.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n\t<li>Reference
    to IEC 61010-031 for probe assemblies and IEC 61010-032 for current sensors has
    been added.</li>\r\n\t<li>Indirect bonding for testing and measuring circuits
    has been modified, in particular to take into account the duration of current
    flow versus body current for a.c. and d.c. currents according to IEC TS 60479-1
    and IEC TS 60479-2.</li>\r\n\t<li>Clearance and creepage distance for wet locations
    and for measuring circuit terminal exceeding 1 000 V a.c. or d.c have been specified.</li>\r\n\t<li>The
    voltage source for testing overvoltage limiting component or circuit may be limited
    to 400 V.</li>\r\n\t<li>Requirements against transient overvoltages for mains
    voltage measuring circuits have been added.</li>\r\n\t<li>Requirements for measuring
    circuits from 1 000 V d.c. to 1 500 V d.c. have been added.</li>\r\n\t<li>The
    corrigendum has been included in Tables K.102 to K.104.</li>\r\n\t<li>Requirements
    for reduction of transient overvoltages have been modified.</li>\r\n\t<li>An informative
    Annex CC about the dimensions of banana terminals has been added.</li>\r\n\t<li>Flowchart
    for insulation according to the type of circuit has been added in a new Annex
    DD.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104."
