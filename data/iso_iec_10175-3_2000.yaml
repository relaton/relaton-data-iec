abstract:
- content: "<p>The Document Printing Application is one component of a coordinated
    set of facilities and standards needed to</p><p>satisfy the printing requirements
    of the modern distributed office. Together, the capabilities provided can enable</p><p>users
    to create and produce high-quality office documents in a consistent and unambiguous
    manner within a</p><p>distributed open systems environment.</p><p>The Document
    Printing Application Standard (ISO/IEC 10175) consists of three parts:</p><p>Part
    1: Abstract service definitions and procedures</p><p>Part 2: Protocol specification</p><p>Part
    3: Management abstract service definition and procedures</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC
    10175 extends the facilities specified in ISO/IEC 10175-1 by adding the capability
    for</p><p>administrators and operators to manage and control printers, print servers
    and all other print objects; in addition, this</p><p>part specifies additional
    capabilities for a print client to control a print job. The text and specifications
    contained in</p><p>this part of ISO/IEC 10175 are derived from IEEE 1387.4 (POSIX)
    - System Administration Part 4 - Printing</p><p>Interfaces. In particular, this
    part of ISO/IEC 10175:</p><p>- specifies additional administrative functions and
    services that may be provided by Document Printing</p><p>Application servers;</p><p>-
    specifies the Document Printing Application abstract service for the additional
    administrative functions</p><p>using the principles established by the Abstract
    Service Definition Conventions (ISO/IEC 10021-3);</p><p>- specifies the requirements
    for conformance with the Document Printing Application for these additional</p><p>administrative
    functions.</p><p>See clause 1 of ISO/IEC 10175-1 for a more extensive description
    of the Document Printing Application.</p>"
