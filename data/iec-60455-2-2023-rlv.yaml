    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60455-2:2023
    specifies methods of test to be used for testing resin based reactive compounds,
    their components and cured compounds used for electrical insulation. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Introduction
