  content: "IEC TR 63367:2021 which is a technical report, summarises the results
    of a round robin on connector end face scratch recognition and verification by
    automated microscopes. The prime objectives of the study were:\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>determine
    the amount of variability (repeatability and reproducibility) when different state-of-the-art
    inspection systems are assessed against IEC 61300-3-35:2015;</li>\r\n\t<li>evaluate
    any system-to-system variation in the quantity of reported scratches;</li>\r\n\t<li>provide
    recommendations to improve the repeatability and reproducibility of fibre optic
    inspection systems.</li>\r\n</ul>"
