abstract:
- content: "IEC 60794-1-2:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60794-1-2:2021
    applies to optical fibre cables for use with telecommunications equipment and
    devices employing similar techniques, and to cables having a combination of both
    optical fibres and electrical conductors. An objective of this document is to
    define general requirements and methodology guidance applicable to all of the
    cable test methods of IEC 60794-1 (all parts). A second objective of this document
    is to provide the end user with an overview of the different test methods contained
    in the different parts of the IEC 60794-1 series. This fifth edition cancels and
    replaces the fourth edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical change with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of cross-reference tables
    listing the new test method numbers and the previous test method numbers."
