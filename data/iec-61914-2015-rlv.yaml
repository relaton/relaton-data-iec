  content: "IEC 61914:2015 RLV contains the International Standard and its Redline
    version. The Redline version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between this standard and its previous edition. The Redline version
    is not an official IEC Standard, only the current version of the standard is to
    be considered the official document.<br />\r\nIEC 61914:2015 specifies requirements
    and tests for cable cleats and intermediate restraints used for securing cable
    in electrical installations. Cable cleats provide resistance to electromechanical
    forces where declared. This standard includes cable cleats that rely on a mounting
    surface specified by the manufacturer for axial and/or lateral retention of cables.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2009.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Additional declaration and test for lateral load retention depending on cleat
    mounting orientation with associated new figures;<br />\r\nb) Additional declaration
    of the distance between the cable centres in any short-circuit test and associated
    new figures;<br />\r\nc) Specification of the cable to be used in short-circuit
    testing and relaxation of the ambient temperature limits for the test;<br />\r\nd)
    Additional requirement to photograph the short-circuit test arrangement before
    and after the test and to record more complete details of the cable used;<br />\r\ne)
    Revised parameters for the test of resistance to UV light.<br />\r\nThis edition
    also includes the following editorial changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\nf) Revised and updated normative references and bibliography; g) Editorial
    clarification of definitions;<br />\r\nh) Editorial clarification of procedures
    for selection of test samples and the testing of cleats designed for more than
    one cable;<br />\r\ni) Relaxation of some mandrel material requirements;<br />\r\nj)
    Clarification of the inspection requirements following a short-circuit test and
    adding the option of either a.c. or d.c. voltage testing following a second short-circuit;<br
    />\r\nk) Clarification that the resistance to corrosion test applies to all types
    of fixing;<br />\r\nl) New cleat example illustration."
