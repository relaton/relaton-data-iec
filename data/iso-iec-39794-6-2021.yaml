    <p>This document specifies:</p>
    <p>—     generic extensible data interchange formats for the representation of iris image data: a tagged binary data format based on an extensible specification in ASN.1 and a textual data format based on an XML schema definition that are both capable of holding the same information,</p>
    <p>—     examples of data record contents,</p>
    <p>—     application specific requirements, recommendations, and best practices in data acquisition, and</p>
    <p>—     conformance test assertions and conformance test procedures applicable to this document.</p>
    <p>The iris image information is stored as:</p>
    <p>—     an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1, or</p>
    <p>—     an array of intensity values optionally compressed with ISO/IEC 15948 or ISO/IEC 15444-1 that can be cropped around the iris, with the iris at the centre, and which can incorporate region-of-interest masking of non-iris regions.</p>
    <p>This document also specifies elements of conformance testing methodology, test assertions, and test procedures, as applicable to this document.</p>
    <p>It establishes:</p>
    <p>—     test assertions pertaining to the structure of the iris image data format, as specified in Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9 of this document,</p>
    <p>—     test assertions pertaining to internal consistency by checking the types of values that may be contained within each field, and</p>
    <p>—     semantic test assertions.</p>
    <p>The conformance testing methodology specified in this document does not establish:</p>
    <p>—     tests of other characteristics of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance, robustness, security), or</p>
    <p>—     tests of conformance of systems that do not produce data records conforming to the requirements of this document.</p>
    <p>This document does not establish:</p>
    <p>—     requirements on the optical specifications of cameras, or</p>
    <p>—     requirements on photometric properties of iris images, or</p>
    <p>—    requirements on enrolment processes, workflow and use of iris equipment.</p>
