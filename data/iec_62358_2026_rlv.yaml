abstract:
- content: "IEC 62358:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62358:2026
    provides standard AL values (inductance factors) and their tolerances of Pot,
    RM, ETD, E, EER, EP, PQ, PM, EC, EFD and low-profile gapped ferrite cores.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of AL value (inductance factor)
    and its tolerance for PM-cores;<br />\r\nb) addition of AL value (inductance factor)
    and its tolerance for EC-cores;<br />\r\nc) addition of AL value (inductance factor)
    and its tolerance for EFD-cores."
