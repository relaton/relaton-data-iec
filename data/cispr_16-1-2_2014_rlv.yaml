abstract:
- content: "CISPR 16-1-2:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nCISPR 16-1-2:2014 specifies
    the characteristics and performance of equipment for the measurement of radio
    disturbance voltages and currents in the frequency range 9 kHz to 1 GHz. It has
    the status of a basic EMC publication. Specifications for ancillary apparatus
    are included for artificial mains networks, current and voltage probes and coupling
    units for current injection on cables. It is intended that the requirements of
    this publication are fulfilled at all frequencies and for all levels of radio
    disturbance voltages and currents within the CISPR indicating range of the measuring
    equipment. Methods of measurement are covered in the CISPR 16-2 series, and further
    information on radio disturbance is given in CISPR 16-3, while uncertainties,
    statistics and limit modelling are covered in the CISPR 16-4 series. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003 and its Amendment
    1 (2004) and Amendment 2 (2006). This edition constitutes a technical revision
    which includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- requirements from CISPR 22 for the AAN have been
    copied to this standard;<br />\r\n- and the CDNE for measurement of disturbance
    voltage in the frequency range 30 MHz to 300 MHz is added."
