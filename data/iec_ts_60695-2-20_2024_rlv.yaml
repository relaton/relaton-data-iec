abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60695-2-20:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 60695-2-20:2024,
    which is a technical specification, describes a test method that applies to solid
    electrical insulating materials of which test specimens can be provided. The test
    measures the time required to ignite a test specimen when it is affected by heat
    from an electrically heated wire wound around the test specimen. The test method
    can be used to provide classifications which can be used for quality assurance,
    the preselection of materials of products as described in IEC 60695-1-30, or to
    verify the required minimum classification of materials used in end products.
    This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2021.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\nRemoved all text which was related to drip or dripping, since in this 4th
    edition only ignition is taken into consideration for determination of the classification
    level;<br />\r\nTitle changed: \"Hot wire coil test method\" is now \"Hot wire
    ignition (HWI) test method\"."
