abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63001:2019 provides a technique of measurement and evaluation of
    ultrasound in liquids for use in cleaning devices and equipment. It specifies<br
    />\r\n• the cavitation measurement at 2,25 f0 in the frequency range 20 kHz to
    150 kHz, and<br />\r\n• the cavitation measurement by extraction of broadband
    spectral components in the frequency range 10 kHz to 5 MHz.<br />\r\nIEC TS 63001:2019
    covers the measurement and evaluation of the cavitation, but not its secondary
    effects (cleaning results, sonochemical effects, etc.)."
