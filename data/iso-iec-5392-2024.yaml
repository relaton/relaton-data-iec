  content: <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document defines a reference
    architecture of knowledge engineering (KE) in artificial intelligence (AI). The
    reference architecture describes KE roles, activities, constructional layers,
    components and their relationships amongst themselves and other systems from systemic
    user and functional views. This document also provides a common KE vocabulary
    by defining KE terms.</span></p>
