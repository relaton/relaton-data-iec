abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13873:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of Call Diversion supplementary services (SS-DIV) at the Q reference point between
    Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within
    a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). The Call Diversion supplementary
    services are Call Forwarding Unconditional (SS-CFU), Call Forwarding Busy (SS-CFB),
    Call Forwarding No Reply (SS-CFNR) and Call Deflection (SS-CD).</p><p>SS-CFU,
    SS-CFB, SS-CFNR and SS-CD are supplementary services which permit a served user
    to have the PISN send all or specific incoming calls addressed to the served user's
    PISN number to another number.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC
    11579-1.</p><p>Service specifications are produced in three stages and according
    to the method specified in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13873:2003 contains the stage
    3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified
    by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 13872.</p><p>The signalling
    protocol for SS-DIV operates on top of the signalling protocol for basic circuit
    switched call control, as specified in ISO/IEC 11572 and uses certain aspects
    of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified
    in ISO/IEC 11582.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13873:2003 also specifies additional signalling
    protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point
    between SS-DIV and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13873:2003
    is applicable to PINXs which can be interconnected to form a PISN.</p>"
