abstract:
- content: "IEC 61557-12:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61557-12:2018
    specifies requirements for power metering and monitoring devices (PMD) that measure
    and monitor the electrical quantities within electrical distribution systems,
    and optionally other external signals. These requirements also define the performance
    in single- and three-phase AC or DC systems having rated voltages up to 1 000
    V AC or up to 1 500 V DC. These devices are fixed or portable. They are intended
    to be used indoors and/or outdoors. Power metering and monitoring devices (PMD),
    as defined in this document, give additional safety information, which aids the
    verification of the installation and enhances the performance of the distribution
    systems. The power metering and monitoring devices (PMD) for electrical parameters
    described in this document are used for general industrial and commercial applications.
    This document does not address functional safety and cyber security aspects. This
    document is not applicable for:<br />\r\n– electricity metering equipment that
    complies with IEC 62053-21, IEC 62053-22, IEC 62053-23 and IEC 62053-24. Nevertheless,
    uncertainties defined in this document for active and reactive energy measurement
    are derived from those defined in IEC 62053 (all parts);<br />\r\n– the measurement
    and monitoring of electrical parameters defined in IEC 61557-2 to IEC 61557-9
    and IEC 61557-13 or in IEC 62020;<br />\r\n– power quality instrument (PQI) according
    IEC 62586 (all parts);<br />\r\n– devices covered by IEC 60051 (all parts) (direct
    acting analogue electrical measuring instrument). IEC 61557-12:2018 cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) PMD-A has been withdrawn due the
    fact these devices are now mainly covered by the IEC 62586 series of standards.<br
    />\r\nb) Three categories of PMD have been created with a list of minimum required
    functions for each category.<br />\r\nc) Added a new Annex A explaining the different
    applications linked to the relevant standards and devices, and another new Annex
    C about the power factor conventions.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    1 (2022-09) have been included in this copy."
