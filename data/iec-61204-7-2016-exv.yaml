    version is available in English only.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61204-7:2016 specifies
    the safety requirements for switch mode power supply (SMPS) units supplied by
    source voltages up to 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC providing AC and/or DC output(s),
    except inverter output(s) establishing AC mains. This product standard covers
    both stand-alone and component SMPS as defined in this document. DC power and
    distribution equipment which provides, distributes, monitors, and controls isolated
    secondary circuit power to other equipment typically used in information and communication
    technology equipment installations. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) use of IEC
    62477-1 as reference document, instead of IEC 60950-1;<br />\r\nb) modification
