- content: |-
    defines a protocol enabling precise synchronization of clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as network communication, local computing, and distributed
    objects. The protocol will be applicable to systems communicating by local area networks supporting multicast
    messaging including, but not limited to, Ethernet. This standard is published under the double logo IEC/IEEE.
