    <p>ISO/IEC 29341-20-10:2017 is compliant with UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [14]. </p>
    <p>This service type enables control over the transport of audio and video streams. The service type defines a common model for A/V transport control suitable for a generic user interface. It can be used to control a wide variety of disc, tape and solid-state based media devices such as CD players, VCRs and MP3 players. A minimal implementation of this service can be used to control tuners. </p>
    <p>The service type is related to the ConnectionManager service type, which describes A/V connection setup procedures, and the ContentDirectory service, which offers meta-information about the resource stored on the media. AVTransport also offers an action to retrieve any metadata embedded in the resource itself. </p>
    <p>This service type does not offer scheduled recording.</p>
