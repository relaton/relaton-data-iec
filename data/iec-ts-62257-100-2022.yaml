  content: "IEC TS 62257-100:2022 introduces the entire series regarding off-grid
    renewable energy and hybrid products and systems most commonly used for rural
    applications and access to electricity. This document provides a guide for facilitating
    the reading and the use of the IEC 62257 series for setting up off-grid electrification
    in developing countries or in developed countries, the only difference being the
    level of service and the needed quantity of energy that the customer can afford.<br
    />\r\nThis document outlines the organization of documents within the updated
    IEC 62257-xxx series published in 2022 and later, including utilization of a new
    3-digit part numbering scheme, grouped into topics and subtopics."
