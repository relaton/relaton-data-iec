abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23270:2003 specifies the form and establishes the interpretation
    of programs written in the C# programming language. It specifies:</p><ul><li>the
    representation of C# programs;</li><li>the syntax and constraints of the C# language;</li><li>the
    semantic rules for interpreting C# programs;</li><li>the restrictions and limits
    imposed by a conforming implementation of C#.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 23270:2003 does
    not specify:</p><ul><li>the mechanism by which C# programs are transformed for
    use by a data-processing system;</li><li>the mechanism by which C# applications
    are invoked for use by a data-processing system;</li><li>the mechanism by which
    input data are transformed for use by a C# application;</li><li>the mechanism
    by which output data are transformed after being produced by a C# application;</li><li>the
    size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the capacity of
    any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular processor;</li><li>all
    minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of supporting
    a conforming implementation.</li></ul>"
