  content: "IEC 62604-2:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62604-2:2022
    applies to duplexers which can separate receiving signals from transmitting signals
    and are key components for two-way radio communications, and which are generally
    used in mobile phone systems compliant with CDMA systems such as N-CDMA in second
    generation mobile telecommunication systems (2G), W-CDMA / UMTS (3G) or LTE (4G).
    These guidelines draw attention to some fundamental questions about the theory
    of SAW and BAW duplexers and how to use them, which will be considered by the
    user before he places an order for SAW and BAW duplexers for a new application.
    Such a procedure will be the user’s insurance against unsatisfactory performance.
    Because SAW and BAW duplexers have very similar performance for the usage, it
    is useful and convenient for users that both duplexers are described in one standard.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the term \"cross-isolation\" has been added
    to Clause 3;<br />\r\n- multiplexers are described.<br />\r\nNOTE In this document,
    SAW and BAW duplexers are treated simultaneously because both duplexers are used
    in the same manner, especially in mobile phone systems and have the same requirements
    of characteristics, test method and so on."
