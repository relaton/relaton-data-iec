abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines a system interface for compiled applications
    and a minimal environment for support of installation scripts. Its purpose is
    to enable a uniform industry standard environment for high-volume applications
    conforming to the LSB.<br />These specifications are composed of two basic parts:
    a common part describing those parts of the interface that remain constant across
    all implementations of the LSB, and an architecture-specific part describing the
    parts of the interface that vary by processor architecture. Together, the common
    part and the relevant architecture-specific part for a single hardware architecture
    provide a complete interface specification for compiled application programs on
    systems that share a common hardware architecture.<br />The LSB contains both
    a set of Application Program Interfaces (APIs) and Application Binary Interfaces
    (ABIs). APIs may appear in the source code of portable applications, while the
    compiled binary of that application may use the larger set of ABIs. A conforming
    implementation provides all of the ABIs listed here. The compilation system may
    replace (e.g. by macro definition) certain APIs with calls to one or more of the
    underlying binary interfaces, and may insert calls to binary interfaces as needed.<br
    />The LSB is primarily a binary interface definition. Not all of the source level
    APIs available to applications may be contained in this specification.<br />This
    is the Imaging module of the Linux Standard Base (LSB). This module provides the
    fundamental system interfaces, libraries, and runtime environment upon which conforming
    applications and libraries requiring the LSB Imaging module depend.<br />Interfaces
    described in LSB Imaging are mandatory except where explicitly listed otherwise.
    Interfaces described in the LSB Imaging module supplement those described in the
    LSB Core module. They do not depend on other LSB modules.</p>"
