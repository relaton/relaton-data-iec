abstract:
- content: ISO TR 24971:2013 provides guidance in addressing specific areas of ISO
    14971 when implementing risk management. This guidance is intended to assist manufacturers
    and other users of the standard to understand the role of international product
    safety and process standards in risk management, develop the policy for determining
    the criteria for risk acceptability, incorporate production and post-production
    feedback loop into risk management, differentiate between "information for safety"
    and "disclosure of residual risk", and evaluate overall residual risk.
