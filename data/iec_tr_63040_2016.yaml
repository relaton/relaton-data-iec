abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63040:2016(E) describes test results of research on dimensioning
    of clearances and creepage distances, for spacing equal to or less than 2 mm for
    printed wiring material and other equivalent arrangements of insulation, where
    the clearance and the creepage distance follows the same path along the surface
    of solid insulation. The information contained in this document is the result
    of research only and cannot be used for dimensioning the clearances and creepage
    distances for equipment within low-voltage systems, where IEC 60664-1 applies.
    However distances can be taken into account for functional reasons. This document
    provides results of research related to the following criteria:<br />\r\n1) clearances
    independent from the micro-environment;<br />\r\n2) creepage distances for pollution
    degree 1, 2 and 3 which extends the use of smaller distances to products having
    design features similar to printed circuit boards;<br />\r\n3) creepage distances
    to avoid flashover of the insulating surface;<br />\r\n4) information on minimum
    creepage distances to maintain minimum insulation resistance.<br />\r\nA test
    method for the evaluation of the relevant water adsorption group for the surface
    of any insulating material which has not yet been classified is described.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of January 2019 have been included in this
    copy."
