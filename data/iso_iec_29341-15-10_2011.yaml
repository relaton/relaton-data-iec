abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-15-10:2011 Describes the Content Synchronization service which enables two
    or more ContentDirectory services [CDS] to synchronize content with each other.
    This service also enables a UPnP control point to synchronize content with a ContentDirectory
    service. We refer this service as \"CSS\" or \"ContentSync service\" from hereon.
    If a CDS wants to support synchronization of objects and its resources with other
    CDSs, the implementation MUST enable this ContentSync service (CSS). CSS keeps
    change log as part of CDS object property that describe which CDS objects are
    added or modified or deleted since it has synchronized last. Since synchronization
    enables interaction between ContentSync services, each service has a Control Point
    (CP) functionality that invokes actions to other ContentSync service to achieve
    synchronization of contents with each other. This service definition is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0."
