  content: "IEC SRD 63320-1:2023 In recent years, research on the relationship between
    information and communication technology (ICT) and cities, focused on imagining
    the future of urban planning, has been one of the most interesting topics in the
    industry. Smart urban planning (SUP) for smart cities is a relatively new concept
    and has not received much attention around the world. The “smartness” of urban
    planning describes the intensive use of digital technologies to optimize the urban
    planning process. The concept of \"smart city\" has been implemented and developed
    all over the world. In order to construct a smart city successfully, knowing how
    to implement SUP for smart cities is essential, because it is the foundation of
    smart urban construction. However, at present, reaching a consensus on the overall
    architecture of standards of SUP for smart cities is still challenging.<br />\r\nThis
    part of IEC SRD 63320 explains the definition, development goals and theoretical
    models of smart urban planning use case collection and analyses. This document
    identifies the key application areas of smart urban planning and determines the
    stakeholders and the relationships among them in the guidance of use case template."
