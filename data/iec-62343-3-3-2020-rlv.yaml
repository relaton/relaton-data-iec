  content: "IEC 62343-3-3:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62343-3-3:2020
    provides a performance specification template for wavelength selective switches.
    The object is to provide a framework for the preparation of detail specifications
    on the performance of wavelength selective switches. Additional specification
    parameters are often included for detailed product specifications or performance
    specifications if necessary. However, specification parameters specified in this
    document are not removed from the detail product specifications or performance
    specifications. The technical information regarding wavelength selective switches
    and their applications in DWDM systems with single-mode fibres are described in
    IEC TR 62343-6-4. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- modification of the normative references;<br />\r\n- modification of the
    terms and definitions."
