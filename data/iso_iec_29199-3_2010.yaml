abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29199-3:2010 specifies the use of JPEG XR coding for timed sequences
    of images (motion sequences) within files based on the ISO base media file format
    (ISO/IEC 15444-12).The Motion JPEG XR file format is designed to contain one or
    more motion sequences of JPEG XR images, with their timing. It is intended as
    a â€˜building block', specifying only the video format. An application would be
    expected to combine Motion JPEG XR with suitable audio, metadata, etc. for a complete
    application specification; that specification would normally select profiles and
    levels of Motion JPEG XR, and could also specify application profiles and levels
    that apply to the integration. Motion JPEG XR is expected to be used in a variety
    of applications, particularly where JPEG XR coding technology is already available
    for other reasons, or where the high-quality frame-based approach, with no inter-frame
    coding, is appropriate. Motion JPEG XR is a flexible format, permitting a wide
    variety of usages, such as editing, display, interchange, and streaming.
