    cables described herein are specified up to 1 200 MHz and are specifically designed
    to build patch, equipment, and work area cables as defined in ISO/IEC 11801 and
    ISO/IEC 15018. It covers a cable having four individually screened (STP) pairs.
    The cable may be provided with a common screen over the cable core. The transmission
    characteristics are specified for a frequency range 4 MHz to 1 200 MHz and at
    20 Â°C. The contents of the corrigendum of July 2009 have been included in this
    copy.<strong>This consolidated version consists of the first edition (2009) and
    its amendment 1 (2013). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to this
