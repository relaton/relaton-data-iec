abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 15947:2002 defines a framework for detection of intrusions into
    IT systems. It establishes common definitions for intrusion detection terms and
    concepts. It describes the methodologies, concepts and relationships among them,
    addresses possible orderings of intrusion detection tasks and related activities,
    and attempts to relate these tasks and processes to an organization's or enterprise's
    procedures to demonstrate the practical integration of intrusion detection within
    an organization or enterprise security policy.
