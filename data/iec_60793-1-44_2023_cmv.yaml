abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-44:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60793-1-44:2023 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60793-1-44:2011
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 86A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-44:2023 establishes uniform requirements for measuring
    the cut-off wavelength of single-mode optical fibre, thereby assisting in the
    inspection of fibres and cables for commercial purposes. This document gives methods
    for measuring the cut-off wavelength for uncabled or cabled single mode telecom
    fibre. These procedures apply to all category B and C fibre types. There are three
    methods of deployment for measuring the cut-off wavelength:<br />\r\n- method
    A: cable cut-off using uncabled fibre 22 m long sample, lcc;<br />\r\n- method
    B: cable cut-off using cabled fibre 22 m long sample, lcc;<br />\r\n- method C:
    fibre cut-off using uncabled fibre 2 m long sample, lc.<br />\r\nAll methods require
    a reference measurement. There are two reference-scan techniques, either or both
    of which can be used with all methods:<br />\r\n- bend-reference technique;<br
    />\r\n- multimode-reference technique using category A1(OM1-OM5) multimode fibre.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) used the diameter of the fibre loops to describe deployment;<br />\r\nb)
    added Annex D related to cut-off curve artifacts;<br />\r\nc) reorganized information
    and added more figures to clarify concepts."
