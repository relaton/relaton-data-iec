abstract:
- content: "IEC 60728-2:2018(E) applies to the radiation characteristics and immunity
    to electromagnetic disturbance of EM active equipment (active and passive equipment)
    for the reception, processing and distribution of television, sound and interactive
    multimedia signals as dealt with in IEC 60728-3, IEC 60728-4, IEC 60728-5 and
    IEC 60728-6.<br />\r\nThis document covers the following frequency ranges:<br
    />\r\n- disturbance voltage injected into the mains: 150 kHz to 30 MHz;<br />\r\n-
    radiation from active equipment: 5 MHz to 25 GHz;<br />\r\n- immunity of active
    equipment: 150 kHz to 25 GHz;<br />\r\n- screening effectiveness of passive equipment:
    5 MHz to 3,5 GHz.<br />\r\nThis document specifies requirements for maximum allowed
    radiation, minimum immunity and minimum screening effectiveness and describes
    test methods for conformance testing.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Frequency extensions:<br />\r\na.1)
    The upper frequency limit of conventional cable network equipment was extended
    from 862 MHz to 1 000 MHz due to market demands.<br />\r\na.2) The first intermediate
    frequency range (1st IF range) for satellite signal transmission was extended
    to cover now frequencies from 950 MHz up to 3 500 MHz.<br />\r\na.3) The methods
    of measurement and the EMC requirements in the overlapping frequency range from
    950 MHz to 1 000 MHz were allocated in relation to the upper frequency limit,
    1 000 MHz, and the lower frequency limit, 950 MHz, of the relevant equipment under
    test.<br />\r\nb) New EMC environment in the 800 MHz band:<br />\r\nb.1) The European
    Commission has requested CENELEC and ETSI to draft immunity requirements for equipment,
    to protect against disturbance from the new wireless service in the 790 MHz to
    862 MHz band.<br />\r\nb.2) A CENELEC/ETSI Joint Working Group “Digital Dividend”
    was formed to describe the new EMC environment and to advise on appropriate test
    methods and limits.<br />\r\nb.3) IEC 60728-2 is the document specifying immunity
    requirements for active and passive cable network equipment.<br />\r\nb.4) The
    method of measurement and the requirements for in-band immunity were extended
    taking into account this new EMC environment due to the allocation of broadband
    wireless services in the frequency band 694 MHz to 862 MHz. As a consequence,
    the limits of in-band immunity were specified for analogue and additionally for
    digital signals in this frequency range.<br />\r\nb.5) Consequently it is recommended,
    that, where cable networks and wireless networks coexist, only the transmission
    of digitally modulated signals should be used in the frequency range 694 MHz to
    862 MHz.<br />\r\nb.6) For passive equipment, Class A and Class B specifications
    were kept in the standard but a note was added recommending that only Class A
    equipment should be used in the planning and implementation of new networks.<br
    />\r\nc) The methods of measurement for all kinds of indoor antennas were combined
    in the new 4.9.<br />\r\nd) A Bibliography has been added at the end of the document
    referencing, for example, CEPT Report 30 on “The identification of common and
    minimal (least restrictive) technical conditions for 790-862 MHz for the digital
    dividend in the European Union”."
