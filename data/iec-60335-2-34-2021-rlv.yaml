  content: "IEC 60335-2-34:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-34:2021
    deals with the safety of sealed (hermetic and semi-hermetic type) motor-compressors,
    their protection and control systems, if any, which are intended for use in equipment
    for household and similar purposes and which conform with the standards applicable
    to such equipment. It applies to motor-compressors tested separately, under the
    most severe conditions that may be expected to occur in normal use, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase motor-compressors and 600 V
    for other motor-compressors.<br />\r\nThis standard also covers:<br />\r\n- multi-speed
    motor-compressors, that are motor-compressors, the speed of which can be set to
    different values;<br />\r\n- variable capacity motor-compressors that are motor-compressors
    where the capacity of the compressor is controlled at fixed speeds.<br />\r\nExamples
    of equipment which contain motor-compressors are:<br />\r\n- tumble dryers (IEC
    60335-2-11);<br />\r\n- refrigerating appliances, ice-cream appliances and ice-makers
    (IEC 60335-2-24);<br />\r\n- electrical heat pumps, air-conditioners and dehumidifiers
    (IEC 60335-2-40);<br />\r\n- commercial dispensing appliances and vending machines
    (IEC 60335-2-75);<br />\r\n- commercial refrigerating appliances and ice-makers
    with an incorporated or remote refrigerant unit or compressor (IEC 60335-2-89);<br
    />\r\n- electrical equipment for measurement, control, and laboratory use (IEC
    61010-2-011);<br />\r\n- professional ice-cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118);<br />\r\n-
    refrigerating systems and heat pumps – Design, construction, testing, marking
    and documentation (ISO 5149-2).<br />\r\nThis standard does not supersede the
    requirements of standards relevant to the particular appliance in which the motor-compressor
    is used. However, if the motor-compressor type used complies with this standard,
    the tests for the motor-compressor specified in the particular appliance standard
    may not need to be made in the particular appliance or assembly. If the motor-compressor
    control system is associated with the particular appliance control system, additional
    tests could be necessary on the final appliance.<br />\r\nSo far as is practical,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by motor-compressors used
    in appliances which are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    it does not in general take into account:<br />\r\n- the use of appliances by
    young children or infirm persons without supervision;<br />\r\n- playing with
    the appliances by young children.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br
    />\r\n- for motor-compressors intended to be used in appliances in vehicles or
    on board ships, additional require¬ments could be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many
    countries, additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities,
    the national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar
    authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- motor-compressors
    designed exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- motor-compressors used
    in appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nIf motor-compressors for refrigerant R-744 used in appliances with a transcritical
    refrigeration system are equipped with pressure relief devices, compliance with
    the requirements for these devices is checked during the tests on the final appliance.<br
    />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2012,
    Amendment 1:2015 and Amendment 2:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- it aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5.2;<br
    />\r\n- application categories and tests have been extended (3.1.102, Annex AA);<br
    />\r\n- use of a motorette for winding wire compatibility tests introduced (3.8.102,
    Annex BB);<br />\r\n- height of the triangle, symbol ISO 7010 W021 has been introduced
    (7.14);<br />\r\n- some notes are converted to normative text (1, 15.3, 22.21,
    23.8, 29.3.4, Figure AA.1);<br />\r\n- note in Subclause 6.101 becomes normative
    in Clause 11;<br />\r\n- optional pressure endurance test introduced (18.101,
    Annex EE);<br />\r\n- compatibility test for insulation inside the housing clarified
    (22.9);<br />\r\n- clarification of clearances inside the housing for motor-compressors
    suitable for use at altitudes exceeding 2 000 m (29.1);<br />\r\n- normative references
    and associated text have been updated (24.101, Annex DD);<br />\r\n- breaking
    strength of tie cord after temperature heating cycle has been updated (Annex CC).<br
    />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC
    60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis of the fifth edition
    (2010) of that standard."
