abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 28360:2012 specifies methods to determine chemical emission
    rates of analyte from information and communication technology (ICT) and consumer
    electronics (CE) equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test Chamber
    (ETC).</p><p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled
    ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    28360:2012 includes specific methods for equipment using consumables, such as
    printers, and equipment not using consumables, such as monitors and PCs. It also
    specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for use in the operating phase
    of EUT using consumables (e.g. paper).</p>"
