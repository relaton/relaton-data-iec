abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62453-501:2009(E) provides additional information for integrating
    the Foundation Fieldbus (FF) protocol into the COM implementation of the FDT Specification
    (IEC/TR 62453-41). It describes communication definitions, protocol specific extensions
    and the means for block (e.g. transducer, resource or function blocks) representation.
    The new protocol specific definitions are based on FF-Specifications for H1 and
    HSE protocols. Furthermore, the definitions contain information that is needed
    by systems to configure FF Devices.
