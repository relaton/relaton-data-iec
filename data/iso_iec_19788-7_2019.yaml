abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19788-7:2019 This document provides RDF mappings of the different
    MLR entities introduced in the MLR framework (ISO/IEC 19788â€‘1 and its amendment):
    data element specifications (DESs), resource classes (RCs), data elements (DEs),
    application profiles (APs), MLR records and data element group specifications
    (DEGSs).<br />\r\nThis document associates HTTP IRIs (linguistically neutral and
    linguistic) to conceptual MLR entities denoted by MLR identifiers. This is needed
    for the management of MLR entities and their versions.<br />\r\nMoreover, this
    document provides excerpts of an OWL 2 DL ontology for the resource classes and
    data element specifications (properties) introduced in the ISO/IEC 19788 series."
