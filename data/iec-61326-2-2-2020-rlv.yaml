  content: "IEC 61326-2-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61326-2-2:2020
    specifies more detailed test configurations, operational conditions and performance
    criteria for equipment covered by Annex A of IEC 61326-1:2020 which is:<br />\r\n-
    used for testing, measuring or monitoring of protective measures in low-voltage
    distribution systems, and;<br />\r\n- powered by battery and/or from the circuit
    measured, and<br />\r\n- portable.<br />\r\nExamples of such EUTs include, but
    are not limited to, voltage detectors, insulation testers, earth continuity testers,
    earth resistance testers, leakage current clamps, loop impedance testers, “residual-current-device-testers”
    (RCD-testers) and phase sequence testers as defined in IEC 61557 (all parts)."
