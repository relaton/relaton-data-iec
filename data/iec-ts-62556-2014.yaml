  content: 'IEC TS 62556:2014 is a technical specification applicable to high intensity
    therapeutic ultrasound (HITU) devices. It specifies the relevant parameters for
    quantifying the field; the measurement methods at relatively low output levels
    and methodology for extrapolating these to higher therapeutic level fields; some
    considerations of sidelobes and pre-focal maxima; and parameters relevant to HITU
    transducers of different construction and geometry, including non-focusing, focusing
    with or without lenses, collimated, diverging and convergent transducers, multi-element
    transducers, scanning transducers and multiple sources. This technical specification
    is intended to support the ultrasonic measurement requirements given in IEC 60601-2-62.
    These specifications would have use in quality assurance, safety testing, and
    the standardization of communications regarding the clinical performance of HITU
    systems. Where possible, this technical specification incorporates specifications
    from other related standards. This technical specification does not apply to the
    following types of devices, which are covered by other standards: lithotripters
    (see IEC 61846); surgical equipment (see IEC 61847); and physiotherapy devices
    (see IEC 61689).'
