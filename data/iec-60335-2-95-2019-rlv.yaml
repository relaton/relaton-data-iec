  content: "IEC 60335-2-95:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-95:2019
    deals with the safety of electric drives for garage doors for residential use
    that open and close in a vertical direction, the rated voltage of the drives being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances.
    It also covers the hazards associated with the movement of these electrically
    driven garage doors. The drive can be supplied with a garage door. This standard
    also applies to entrapment protection devices for use with drives. It does not
    cover hazards related to the mechanisms of the door itself. As far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account playing with the appliance by young children, but recognizes that children
    may be in the vicinity of the garage door. Attention is drawn to the fact that
    in many countries additional requirements are specified by the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to drives<br />\r\n- for shutters, awnings, blinds and
    similar equipment (IEC 60335-2-97);<br />\r\n- for gates, doors and windows (IEC
    60335-2-103);<br />\r\n- for commercial and industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2011, Amendment 1:
    2015 and Amendment 2:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with edition 5.2 of Part
    1;<br />\r\nb) reference to IEC 60335-2-97 and IEC 60335-2-103 has been revised
    to correctly state their titles (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) specific instruction statements
    have been revised to separate them from information to be provided (7.12);<br
    />\r\nd) the compliance criteria for the tests of 19.11.2 and 19.11.3 has been
    modified (19.13);<br />\r\ne) the tests for class III appliances and parts of
    class III constructions have been modified (25.8, 25.15).<br />\r\nThis part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments.
    It was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
