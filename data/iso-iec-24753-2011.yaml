    <p>ISO/IEC 24753:2011 defines a minimum application protocol to support sensors and the monitoring of batteries in conjunction with RFID tags utilizing the air interface as defined in the ISO/IEC 18000 series.</p>
    <p>It provides common encoding rules for identifying sensors, their functions, and their delivered measurements. It also defines the process rules to support the following functions: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>selecting and de-selecting a particular sensory function when more than one is supported by the RFID tag;</li>
    <li>setting sensor parameters both initially and ongoing;</li>
    <li>starting and stopping the monitoring function of a sensor;</li>
    <li>accessing sensor data; and</li>
    <li>carrying out basic processing of sensor data and interpreting this into a format that is meaningful for an application.</li>
    </ul>
