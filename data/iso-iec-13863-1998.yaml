    <p>This International Standard specifies the Path Replacement additional network feature (ANF-PR), which is applicable to</p>
    <p>various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>ANF-PR is a feature which applies to an established call, allowing that call's connection between Private Integrated Services</p>
    <p>Network Exchanges (PINXs) to be replaced by a new connection. If the new connection is required to satisfy certain criteria,</p>
    <p>ANF-PR should be used in conjunction with other supplementary services and/or ANFs. Annex A gives examples of the</p>
    <p>circumstances under which ANF-PR can be used and criteria which can govern the selection of the new connection.</p>
    <p>Additional network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT</p>
    <p>Recommendation I.130 for supplementary services. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications</p>
    <p>of ANF-PR. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the feature as seen by an entity which initiates path replacement, the</p>
    <p>ANF-PR user. The stage 2 specification (clauses 7, 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the feature and the</p>
    <p>information flows between them. Clause 7 contains the stage 2 specification for basic operation of the feature. Clause 8</p>
    <p>contains the stage 2 specification for an enhanced mode of working which can be employed when supported by all the</p>
    <p>equipment involved. It allows some of the elements of the old connection to be re-used. Clause 9 contains the stage 2</p>
    <p>specification for an optional enhancement of the basic operation of the feature. It allows the ANF-PR user to be located in any</p>
    <p>PINX in the old connection and to decide the direction of the new connection.</p>
