  content: 'IEC/TR 62809:2013(E) provides an overview of the requirements and tests
    of IEC 60601-2-66 in combination with the applicable sections of IEC 60601-1,
    and the collateral standards of the IEC 60601 series. It is intended to assist
    various groups involved in the product lifecycles process - like designers and
    suppliers - to get an overview of the basic requirements without studying all
    involved standard documents in detail. The table includes not all but just the
    more common requirements and tests. During the preparation of IEC 60601-2-66,
    members of the involved technical committee and working group voiced concerns
    about the complexity of the document and its structure as part of the IEC 60601
    series. There was also concern that groups in the hearing instrument community
    would have problems to understand and apply the standard and that this could be
    an issue with its acceptability. In order to have a broad consensus for the new
    standard it was agreed that the standard should be supported by this Technical
    Report, which should enable members of the community and the industry to have
    a basic understanding of the requirements of the standard, without the need to
    study the complete standard document and the documents that are referenced in
    it. It is crucial to understand that the summary in this document cannot serve
    as an input for a product requirement specification or as a test plan without
    consulting the standard document itself. This Technical Report alone cannot be
    used to establish or assess compliance to the standard. Keywords: hearing instruments,
    hearing aids, hearing'
