abstract:
- content: 'Describes a method to check, in terms of functional parameters, that the
    constancy of the quality of images produced by intra-oral dental X-ray equipment
    is maintained after installation, calibration and adjustment have been carried
    out. This standard defines: - the functional parameters, which describe the performance
    of X-ray equipment for intra-oral dental radiographic examination; - methods of
    checking, whether variations in measured functional parameters meet established
    criteria, in order to ensure that the conditions for adequate imaging performance
    are maintained, while unnecessary irradiation of the patient is avoided.'
