abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the big data reference architecture (BDRA). The
    reference architecture includes concepts and architectural views.<br />\r\nThe
    reference architecture specified in this document defines two architectural viewpoints:<br
    />\r\n- a user view defining roles/sub-roles, their relationships, and types of
    activities within a big data ecosystem;<br />\r\n- a functional view defining
    the architectural layers and the classes of functional components within those
    layers that implement the activities of the roles/sub-roles within the user view.<br
    />\r\nThe BDRA is intended to:<br />\r\n- provide a common language for the various
    stakeholders;<br />\r\n- encourage adherence to common standards, specifications,
    and patterns;<br />\r\n- provide consistency of implementation of technology to
    solve similar problem sets;<br />\r\n- facilitate the understanding of the operational
    intricacies in big data;<br />\r\n- illustrate and understand the various big
    data components, processes, and systems, in the context of an overall big data
    conceptual model;<br />\r\n- provide a technical reference for government departments,
    agencies and other consumers to understand, discuss, categorize and compare big
    data solutions; and<br />\r\n- facilitate the analysis of candidate standards
    for interoperability, portability, reusability, and extendibility."
