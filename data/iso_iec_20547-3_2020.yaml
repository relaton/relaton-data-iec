abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the big data reference architecture (BDRA).
    The reference architecture includes concepts and architectural views.</p><p>The
    reference architecture specified in this document defines two architectural viewpoints:</p><p>—
    a user view defining roles/sub-roles, their relationships, and types of activities
    within a big data ecosystem;</p><p>— a functional view defining the architectural
    layers and the classes of functional components within those layers that implement
    the activities of the roles/sub-roles within the user view.</p><p>The BDRA is
    intended to:</p><p>— provide a common language for the various stakeholders;</p><p>—
    encourage adherence to common standards, specifications, and patterns;</p><p>—
    provide consistency of implementation of technology to solve similar problem sets;</p><p>—
    facilitate the understanding of the operational intricacies in big data;</p><p>—
    illustrate and understand the various big data components, processes, and systems,
    in the context of an overall big data conceptual model;</p><p>— provide a technical
    reference for government departments, agencies and other consumers to understand,
    discuss, categorize and compare big data solutions; and</p><p>— facilitate the
    analysis of candidate standards for interoperability, portability, reusability,
    and extendibility.</p>"
