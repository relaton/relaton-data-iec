abstract:
- content: 'The goal of ISO/IEC 24757:2008 is to harmonize industry practices in matters
    of machine-readable keyboard descriptions (PCs, PDAs, various operating systems,
    etc.). It further aims to facilitate the production of interoperable drivers for
    the user and to better assist the user by offering a more precise mapping between
    the physical keyboard layout and geometrical configuration, and the logical interface
    available to the operating system and its applications.ISO/IEC 24757:2008 provides
    a formal description format that can not only fully describe the international
    keyboards standards, but also the capabilities of keyboards on the current and
    future marketplace and their functioning with corresponding operating systems.
    It describes possible interactions between keys of a keyboard and standardizes
    the keyboard description so that it is machine-readable while staying relatively
    easy to interpret by human beings.The keyboard description format is meant to
    be capable of describing existing capabilities of today''s keyboard hardware and
    its associated software, plus foreseeable extensions. It relies on international
    standard format ISO SGML, in the form known as ISO RELAX NG, with an easy conversion
    to industry standard XML. Some additional functionality is covered, such as keyboards
    with programmable keys and keyboards with multiple key assignments such as telephone
    keypads.The keyboard definition format is primarily intended to be used by the
    operating system, and during its boot process (e.g. in the BIOS), but can also
    be used for other purposes, such as reporting from the hardware of a keyboard
    to help the operating system configuring the keyboard driver, or to present the
    keyboard on screen with a user-friendly picture.The keyboard definition format
    is described in four sections: a keyboard identification and general features
    section, including make and model, serial number, country or region and language
    to which the keyboard applies, engraving language identification, and distinctive
    features, such as relief, or presence of lights on keys. the hardware geometry
    layout, which indicates a largely known geometry layout, such as a 102-key PC
    keyboard. This section also gives physical information such as size of keys, and
    amount of pressure needed to activate keys. the keyboard layout, which gives the
    actual assignment of characters to each key. key combinations which gives combinations
    of keys, such as those of characters affected by dead keys. A number of existing
    keyboard definition formats are described, together with a mapping between these
    description formats and the format defined in ISO/IEC 24757:2008.'
