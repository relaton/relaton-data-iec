abstract:
- content: "<p>Thin flexible cards (TFC), the subject of ISO/IEC 15457, are used to
    automate the controls for access to goods or services such as mass transit, highway
    toll systems, car parks, vouchers, stored value, etc.</p><p>For these applications,
    data can be written and/or read by machines using various recording techniques
    such as magnetic stripe, optical character recognition (OCR), bar code, contactless,
    etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15457-1:2008 specifies the physical characteristics of thin
    flexible cards at two points in the card life cycle:</p><ol><li>at the point of
    loading into the card issuing equipment;</li><li>at the point of issue to the
    public.</li></ol><p>It takes into consideration both human and machine aspects
    and states the minimum requirements.</p><p>The principal card sizes are identified
    and the characteristics and dimensions are specified.</p><p>Guidance concerning
    the storage and use of cards under various environmental conditions is given.</p>"
