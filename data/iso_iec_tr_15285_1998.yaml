abstract:
- content: "<p>The purpose of this Technical Report is to provide a general framework
    for discussing characters and glyphs. The framework is applicable to a variety
    of coded character sets and glyph-identification schemes. For illustration, this
    Technical Report uses examples from characters coded in ISO/IEC 10646 and glyphs
    registered according to ISO/IEC 10036.</p><p>This Technical Report</p><p>-differentiates
    between coded characters and registered glyphs</p><p>-identifies the domain of
    use of coded characters and glyph identifiers</p><p>-provides a conceptual framework
    for the formatting and presentation of coded character data using glyph identifiers
    and glyph representations</p><p>This Technical Report describes idealized principles
    that were not completely followed in coding characters for ISO/IEC 10646 and in
    registering glyphs according to ISO/IEC 10036. The fact that ISO/IEC 10646, ISO/IEC
    10036, and other standards do not completely follow the principles in the model
    does not invalidate the model and does not diminish the utility of having the
    model.</p>"
