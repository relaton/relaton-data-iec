abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60825-13:2026 provides manufacturers, test houses, safety personnel,
    and others with practical guidance on methods to perform radiometric measurements
    or analyses to establish the emission level of laser energy or power in accordance
    with IEC 60825-1:2014. The measurement procedures described in this document are
    guidance for classification of laser products in accordance with IEC 60825‑1:2014.
    It is possible that other procedures are better or more appropriate.<br />\r\nInformation
    is provided for calculating accessible emission limits (AELs) and maximum permissible
    exposures (MPEs), since some parameters used in calculating the limits are dependent
    upon other measured quantities.<br />\r\nThis document applies to lasers, including
    extended sources and laser arrays. The procedures described in this document for
    extended source viewing conditions can yield more conservative results than when
    using more rigorous methods.<br />\r\nNOTE Work continues on more complex source
    evaluations and will be provided as international agreement on the methods is
    reached.<br />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces the second edition of
    IEC TR 60825-13 published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to IEC TR 60825-13:2011:<br />\r\na) minor changes and additions have been made
    in the definitions;<br />\r\nb) classification flow has been updated;<br />\r\nc)
    apparent source sections have been clarified;<br />\r\nd) scanning has been updated;<br
    />\r\ne) more examples and useful conversions have been added to the annexes."
