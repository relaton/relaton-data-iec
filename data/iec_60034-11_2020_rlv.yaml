abstract:
- content: "IEC 60034-11:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60034-11:2020
    specifies requirements relating to the use of thermal protectors and thermal detectors
    incorporated into the stator windings or placed in other suitable positions in
    induction machines in order to protect them against serious damage due to thermal
    overloads. It applies to single-speed three-phase 50 Hz or 60 Hz cage induction
    motors in accordance with IEC 60034-1 and IEC 60034-12 that:<br />\r\n- have a
    rated voltage up to 1 000 V;<br />\r\n- are intended for direct-on-line or star-delta
    starting.<br />\r\nThe main changes with respect to the previous edition are:<br
    />\r\n- the additional specification of winding temperature limits for temperature
    class 200 (N),<br />\r\n- the increased limits of maximum winding temperatures
    for overloads with rapid variation,<br />\r\n- the clarification that the motor
    winding may be permanently damaged after it has been exposed to temperatures<br
    />\r\n- a clarification of the definition of indirect thermal protection,<br />\r\n-
    a clarification on the test methods for larger motors."
