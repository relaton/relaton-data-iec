abstract:
- content: "IEC 62040-1:2017 EXV includes the provisions of the general rules dealt
    with in IEC 62477-1:2012. The Extended version is not an official IEC Standard.
    Only the current versions of the related standards are to be considered the official
    documents. The Extended version is available in English only.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    62040-1:2017 applies to movable, stationary, fixed or built-in UPS for use in
    low-voltage distribution systems and that are intended to be installed in an area
    accessible by an ordinary person or in a restricted access area as applicable,
    that deliver fixed frequency AC output voltage with port voltages not exceeding
    1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC and that include an energy storage device. It applies
    to pluggable and to permanently connected UPS, whether consisting of a system
    of interconnected units or of independent units, subject to installing, operating
    and maintaining the UPS in the manner prescribed by the manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies requirements to ensure safety for the ordinary person who comes
    into contact with the UPS and, where specifically stated, for the skilled person.
    The objective is to reduce risks of fire, electric shock, thermal, energy and
    mechanical hazards during use and operation and, where specifically stated, during
    service and maintenance.<br />\r\nThis product standard is harmonized with the
    applicable parts of group safety publication IEC 62477-1:2012 for power electronic
    converter systems and contains additional requirements relevant to UPS.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical change with respect to the
    previous edition: the reference document has been changed from IEC 60950-1:2005
    (safety for IT equipment) to IEC 62477-1 (group safety standard for power electronic
    converters).<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of October 2019 have been
    included in this copy."
