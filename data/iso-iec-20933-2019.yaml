    <p>This document specifies a framework for a distributed real-time Access system. It includes:</p>
    <p>1)    an ID triggered modular system architecture, the functions of the modules, the semantics of messages those modules exchange, and elements of messages;</p>
    <p>2)    the system behaviour from the time it receives an access request until the time it sends the result along with the sequence;</p>
    <p>3)    performance measurement mechanisms using a time stamping function that can be employed for the evaluation of the system.</p>
