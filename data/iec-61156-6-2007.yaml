  content: 'It covers individually screened, common screened and unscreened pairs
    or quads. The transmission characteristics and the frequency range  of the cables
    are specified at 20 °C. The cables covered by this standard are intended to operate
    with voltages and currents normally encountered in communication systems. These
    cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low impedance sources,
    for example, the electric power supplies of public utility mains. The cables described
    herein are intended for work area wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801. includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    a) new requirements for new cables Cat6A, Cat7A for 10 GBase-T applications; b)
    revised requirements and tests for the cables'
