  content: "IEC 61557-4:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61557-4:2019
    specifies the requirements applicable to equipment for measuring the resistance
    of earth conductors, protective earth conductors and conductors for equipotential
    bonding, including their connections and terminals, with an indication of the
    measured value or an indication of the limits. IEC 61557-4:2019 cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) complement to the measurement category in
    Clause 4;<br />\r\nb) correction of the equation for operating uncertainty;<br
    />\r\nc) complement to the requirements for measuring with DC;<br />\r\nd) alignment
    of the structure with that of the whole IEC 61557 series."
