- content: "<p><strong>1.1 Context of the scope</strong></p><p>ISO/IEC 13522 specifies
    the coded representation of multimedia/hypermedia information objects (MHEG objects)</p><p>for
    interchange as final form units within or across services and applications, by
    any means of interchange</p><p>including local area networks, wide area telecommunication
    or broadcast networks, storage media, etc.</p><p>ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 defines
    the MHEG-5 object classes for interchange and use in base-level applications</p><p>intended
    to be run on limited resource terminals such as set-top-boxes in such contexts
    as interactive broadband</p><p>services.</p><p>Annex F of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997
    specifies the features that need to be defined by a specific MHEG-5 application</p><p>domain.
    The informative annexes of this part of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997 give illustrative
    examples of profiles of</p><p>some common application domains.</p><p><strong>1.2
    Scope</strong></p><p>MHEG-5 engines are system or application components that
    handle, interpret and present MHEG-5 objects. The</p><p>scope of this part of
    ISO/IEC 13522 is to define a test suite that can be used to test an MHEG-5 engine's</p><p>conformance
    to a specific application domain. It also defines a format for test cases that
    can be used to extend the</p><p>test suite, either for more detailed testing or
    for extensions defined by the application domain.</p><p>It is beyond the scope
    of this part of ISO/IEC 13522 to define tests for engine performance, engine memory
    usage</p><p>or for MHEG-5 applications that run on these engines.</p><p>This part
    of the ISO/IEC 13522 specifies test cases for<em>all</em>features of ISO/IEC 13522-5:1997.
    Application domains</p><p>define a<em>subset</em>of MHEG-5 features that must
    be supported. In order to test conformance to a specific application</p><p>domain,
    a corresponding<em>subset</em>of the test cases must be defined. This subset of
    the test suite is then used to test</p><p>the conformance of the engine.</p><p>This
    part of ISO/IEC 13522 tests conformance of the behaviour of an MHEG engine. It
    does not validate the</p><p>physical presentation of MHEG-5 objects.</p><p>The
    test suite comprises a set of test cases and a corresponding set of test objects.
    The test cases are defined in</p><p>terms of:</p><p>_ test purpose;</p><p>_ objects
    and procedures which are to be used to test one or more MHEG-5 features;</p><p>_
    expected result.</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 13522-7:2001(E)</strong></p><p>A set of
    content data will be provided for the test objects. These content data are intended
    as a guide for</p><p>generating a test suite and should be converted or replaced
    by content formats appropriate to the Application</p><p>Domain.</p><p>A test suite
    for an Application Domain shall be generated by using the PICS template in subclause
    9.2.1 PICS</p><p>Template.</p>"
