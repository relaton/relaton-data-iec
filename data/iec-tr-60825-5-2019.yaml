  content: "IEC TR 60825-5:2019 is applicable to laser products as described in IEC
    60825-1:2014.<br />\r\nThe checklist is intended for use by manufacturers of laser
    products and their agents to establish that each new or modified design complies
    with the requirements of IEC 60825-1:2014. The checklist is used in conjunction
    with IEC 60825-1, as relevant clauses and subclauses in IEC 60825-1 are referred
    to in the text.<br />\r\nThe layout of the checklist is intended only as a guide.
    Manufacturers and examiners are encouraged to produce their own document, omitting
    questions and clauses that are not relevant to the types of product under examination,
    but noting in the appropriate positions the numbers of such clauses stating, for
    example: \"Subclause 9.11.1: Question omitted – not applicable\".<br />\r\nThe
    manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that the examiner is a person competent
    in the inspection and classification of laser products.<br />\r\nThis third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition of IEC TR 60825-5 published in 2003. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na
    new class, Class 1C, was introduced; the measurement condition 2 (\"eye loupe\"
    condition) was removed; for compliance with non-beam hazards (8.14.1) according
    to relevant product safety standards, a reference was made to corresponding product
    reports.<br />\r\nThis document is to be used in conjunction with IEC 60825-1:2014."
