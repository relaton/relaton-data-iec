  content: "IEC 62364:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 62364:2019
    gives guidelines for:<br />\r\na) presenting data on hydro-abrasive erosion rates
    on several combinations of water quality, operating conditions, component materials,
    and component properties collected from a variety of hydro sites;<br />\r\nb)
    developing guidelines for the methods of minimizing hydro-abrasive erosion by
    modifications to hydraulic design for clean water. These guidelines do not include
    details such as hydraulic profile shapes which are determined by the hydraulic
    design experts for a given site;<br />\r\nc) developing guidelines based on “experience
    data” concerning the relative resistance of materials faced with hydro-abrasive
    erosion problems;<br />\r\nd) developing guidelines concerning the maintainability
    of materials with high resistance to hydro-abrasive erosion and hardcoatings;<br
    />\r\ne) developing guidelines on a recommended approach, which owners could and
    should take to ensure that specifications communicate the need for particular
    attention to this aspect of hydraulic design at their sites without establishing
    criteria which cannot be satisfied because the means are beyond the control of
    the manufacturers;<br />\r\nf) developing guidelines concerning operation mode
    of the hydro turbines in water with particle materials to increase the operation
    life.<br />\r\nIt is assumed in this document that the water is not chemically
    aggressive. Since chemical aggressiveness is dependent upon so many possible chemical
    compositions, and the materials of the machine, it is beyond the scope of this
    document to address these issues. It is assumed in this document that cavitation
    is not present in the turbine. Cavitation and hydro-abrasive erosion can reinforce
    each other so that the resulting erosion is larger than the sum of cavitation
    erosion plus hydro-abrasive erosion. The quantitative relationship of the resulting
    hydro-abrasive erosion is not known and it is beyond the scope of this document
    to assess it, except to suggest that special efforts be made in the turbine design
    phase to minimize cavitation. Large solids (e.g. stones, wood, ice, metal objects,
    etc.) traveling with the water can impact turbine components and produce damage.
    This damage can in turn increase the flow turbulence thereby accelerating wear
    by both cavitation and hydro-abrasive erosion. Hydro-abrasive erosion resistant
    coatings can also be damaged locally by impact of large solids. It is beyond the
    scope of this document to address these issues. This document focuses mainly on
    hydroelectric powerplant equipment. Certain portions can also be applicable to
    other hydraulic machines. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) the formula for TBO in Pelton reference model has been modified;<br
    />\r\nb) the formula for calculating sampling interval has been modified;<br />\r\nc)
    the chapter in hydro-abrasive erosion resistant coatings has been substantially
    modified;<br />\r\nd) the annex with test data for hydro-abrasive erosion resistant
    materials has been removed;<br />\r\ne) a simplified hydro-abrasive erosion evaluation
    has been added.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKey words: Hydraulic Machines, Hydro-Abrasive
