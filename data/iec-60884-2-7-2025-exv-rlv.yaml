  content: "This pack contains IEC 60884-2-7:2025 EXV and IEC 60884-2-7:2025 RLV.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60884-2-7:2025 applies to cord extension sets, rewirable and
    non-rewirable, with or without earthing contact, with a rated voltage greater
    than 50 V but not exceeding 440 V and a rated current not exceeding 16 A, intended
    for household and similar purposes, either indoors or outdoors. This document
    does not apply to cord extension sets with means for reeling. Cord extension sets
    intended to be used as socket-outlets for furniture are additionally covered by
    IEC 60884‑2‑8. This document also applies to cord extension sets which are intended
    to be used in a cable reel, and which therefore become cable reels with a detachable
    flexible cable. For the combination of the cord extension set, the reel requirements
    and tests of IEC 61242 apply in addition.<br />\r\nCord extension sets are suitable
    for use at ambient temperatures not normally exceeding +40 °C, but their average
    temperature over a period of 24 h does not exceed +35 °C, with a lower limit of
    the ambient air temperature of −5 °C.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2011, and Amendment 1:2013. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment to IEC 60884-1, fourth edition."
