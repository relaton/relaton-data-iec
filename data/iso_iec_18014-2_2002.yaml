abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 18014-2:2002 describes time-stamping services producing independent
    tokens. It describes a general model for time-stamping services of this type and
    the basic components used to construct a time-stamping service of this type, it
    defines the data structures and protocols used to interact with a time-stamping
    service of this type, and it describes specific instances of such time-stamping
    services. The usage of independent tokens presumes a high trust on the time-stamping
    authority (TSA). Three independent mechanisms are currently covered: Time-stamps
    using digital signatures In this mechanism the TSA has an asymmetric key pair,
    and uses the private key to digitally sign the time-stamp token. Signature verification
    will use the public key. This mechanism may require the use of a PKI (Public Key
    Infrastructure). Time-stamps using message authentication codes In this mechanism
    the TSA uses a secret key to digitally bind the time association. The time-stamp
    token is authenticated using a Message Authentication Code (MAC). When using this
    mechanism, the TSA is needed to carry out the verification. Time-stamps using
    archivingIn this mechanism the TSA returns a time-stamp token that only has reference
    information to bind the time-stamp to the messageImprint in the time-stamp token.
    The TSA archives locally enough information to verify that the time-stamp is correct.'
