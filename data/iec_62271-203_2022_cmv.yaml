abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-203:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62271-203:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 62271-203:2011
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 17C experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-203:2022 specifies requirements for gas-insulated metal-enclosed
    switchgear in which the insulation is obtained, at least partly, by an insulating
    gas or gas mixture other than air at atmospheric pressure, for alternating current
    of rated voltages above 52 kV, for indoor and outdoor installation, and for service
    frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. This third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the document has been aligned with IEC 62271-1:2017;<br
    />\r\n- beside SF6 also alternative gases have been implemented where needed;<br
    />\r\n- the terms and definitions have been updated and terms not used have been
    removed;<br />\r\n- Subclause 6.16 “Gas and vacuum tightness” has been updated;<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 6.16.3 “Closed pressure systems”: Two classes of gas has been
    introduced:<br />\r\n- GWP ≤ 1 000<br />\r\n- GWP > 1 000<br />\r\nand the tightness
    requirements for type tests for gasses with GWP > 1 000 has been reduced from
    0,5 % to 0,1 % per year per gas compartment;<br />\r\n- Subclause 6.108 “Interfaces”:
    Typical maximum pressures in service for interfaces connected to GIS have been
    defined;<br />\r\n- Subclauses 7.102 through 7.108 have been restructured;<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 7.107 “Corrosion test on earthing connections” has been updated;<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 7.108 “Corrosion tests on sealing systems of enclosures and
    auxiliary equipment” has been updated;<br />\r\n- Annex F ‘Service Continuity’
    has been modified and aligned with the recommendations of CIGRE WG B3.51."
