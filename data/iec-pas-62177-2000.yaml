  content: The highly-accelerated temperature and humidity stress test is performed
    for the purpose of evaluating the reliability of non-hermetic packaged solid-state
    devices in humid environments. It employs severe conditions of temperature, humidity,
    and bias which accelerate the penetration of moisture through the external protective
    material or along the interface between the external protective material and the
    metallic conductors which pass through it.
