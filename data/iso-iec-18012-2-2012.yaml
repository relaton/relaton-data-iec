  content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO&#x2F;IEC 18012-2:2012(E) specifies
    a taxonomy and application interoperability model for the interoperability of
    products in the area of home systems. It also specifies an interoperability framework
    to allow products from multiple manufacturers to work together in order to provide
    a specific application. It describes an application process that exists above
    the OSI reference model (ISO&#x2F;IEC 7498-1) stack, with sufficient detail needed
    to establish interoperable applications in this domain. It is applicable to: single
    implementation home electronic system networks, connected devices and applications,
    multiple implementation home electronic system networks, connected devices and
    applications, automatically configured devices, manually configured devices and
    manually configured groups&#x2F;clusters of devices.'
