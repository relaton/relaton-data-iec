abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29178:2012 defines the functions of a service broker supporting
    service control, MII recognition and MII resolution related functions in Mobile
    AIDC service architecture that uses MII (ISO/IEC 29174) as an identifier. For
    the use of a service broker by a Mobile AIDC terminal, definition is required
    of the interface between a terminal and a service broker. ISO/IEC 29178:2012 describes
    that interface.
