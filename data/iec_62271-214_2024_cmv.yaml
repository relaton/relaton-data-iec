abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-214 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62271-214:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62271-214:2019
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC SC 17C experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-214:2024 specifies requirements for internal
    arc classification of AC metal-enclosed pole-mounted switchgear and controlgear
    with rated voltages above 1 kV and up to and including 52 kV with service frequencies
    up to and including 60 Hz. This document is applicable to three-phase, two-phase
    and single-phase open terminal equipment for which an internal arc classification
    is assigned. Enclosures may include fixed and removable components and may be
    filled with fluid (liquid or gas) to provide insulation. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) indicators positioning update;<br
    />\r\nb) neutral earthing connection of the test circuit for three-phase tests;<br
    />\r\nc) general review for consistency with IEC 62271-200, Ed.3.0:2021."
