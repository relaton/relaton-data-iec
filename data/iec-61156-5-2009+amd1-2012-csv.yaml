  content: "IEC 61156-5:2009+A1:2012(E) describes the cables intended primarily for
    horizontal floor wiring as defined in ISO/IEC 11801. It covers individually screened,
    common screened and unscreened pairs or quads. The transmission characteristics
    and the frequency range of the cables are specified at 20 °C. Those cables are
    intended to be used to support the delivery of low voltage and power applications
    such as IEEE 802.3af (Power over Ethernet) and IEEE 802.3at (Power over Ethernet
    Plus). This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- new requirements for new Cat6A and Cat7A cables;<br />\r\n- revised requirements
    and tests for Cat5e, Cat6 and Cat7 cables. The contents of the corrigendum of
    February 2010 have been included in this copy. <br /><br />This publication is
    to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/en/publication/19107\">IEC61156-1:2002</a>.
    This consolidated version consists of the second edition (2009) and its amendment
    1 (2012)."
