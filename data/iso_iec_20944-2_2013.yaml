abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>The ISO/IEC 20944 series of International
    Standards provides the bindings and their interoperability for metadata registries,
    such as those specified in the ISO/IEC 11179 series of International Standards.
    ISO/IEC 20944-2:2013 contains provisions that are common to coding bindings and
    the coding bindings themselves. The coding bindings have commonality in their
    conceptualization of data instances and their internal structures. Common features
    include:</p><ul><li>using datatypes to characterize the nature and operations
    upon data;</li><li>using ISO/IEC 11404 to define and declare datatypes;</li><li>using
    common aggregate structures, such as array and record, to describe sets of data;</li><li>using
    common navigation descriptions to reference components within a set of data.</li></ul><p>The
    individual coding bindings each incorporate a mapping of common data semantics
    to their individual binding requirements. XML and DIVP (dotted identifier value
    pair) bindings are provided.</p>
