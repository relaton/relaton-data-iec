abstract:
- content: The ISO/IEC 20944 series of International Standards provides the bindings
    and their interoperability for metadata registries, such as those specified in
    the ISO/IEC 11179 series of International Standards. ISO/IEC 20944-2:2013 contains
    provisions that are common to coding bindings and the coding bindings themselves.
    The coding bindings have commonality in their conceptualization of data instances
    and their internal structures. Common features include:using datatypes to characterize
    the nature and operations upon data;using ISO/IEC 11404 to define and declare
    datatypes;using common aggregate structures, such as array and record, to describe
    sets of data;using common navigation descriptions to reference components within
    a set of data.The individual coding bindings each incorporate a mapping of common
    data semantics to their individual binding requirements. XML and DIVP (dotted
    identifier value pair) bindings are provided.
