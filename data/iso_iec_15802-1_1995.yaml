- content: "<p>Forms one of a set of International Standards produced to facilitate
    the interconnection of information processing systems. It is related to other
    International Standards in the set as defined by ISO/IEC 7498-1. The reference
    model described by ISO/IEC 7498-1 subdivides the area of standardization for Open
    Systems Interconnection (OSI) into a series of layers and allows for each layer
    to be further divided into sublayers.</p>"
