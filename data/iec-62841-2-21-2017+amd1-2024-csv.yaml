  content: IEC 62841-2-21:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to hand-held drain cleaners (drain
    cleaners are also known as pipe cleaners) the rated voltage is not more than 250
    V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools, and 480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The
    rated input is not more than 3 700 W. The limits for the applicability of this
    standard for battery tools are given in K.1 and L.1. This standard deals with
    the hazards presented by tools which are encountered by all persons in the normal
    use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the tools. Hand-held electric tools,
    which can be mounted on a support or working stand for use as fixed tools without
    any alteration of the tool itself, are within the scope of this standard and such
    combination of a hand-held tool and a support is considered to be a transportable
    tool and thus covered by the relevant Part 3. This standard does not apply to
    transportable drain cleaners. This standard does not apply to machines that use
    a solid rod to clean drains. This Part 2-21 is to be used in conjunction with
    the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014. The attention of National Committees is
    drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations may need
    a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication
    in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements and to equip
    themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation of the
    committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally
    not earlier than 36 months from the date of publication.
