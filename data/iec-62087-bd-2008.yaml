  content: "IEC 62087:2008(E) specifies methods of measurement for the power consumption
    of television sets, video recording equipment, Set Top Boxes (STBs), audio equipment
    and multi-function equipment for consumer use. Television sets include, but are
    not limited to, those with CRT, LCD, PDP or projection technologies. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2002 and constitutes
    a technical revision. The main changes with respect to the previous edition are
    listed below. Clause 2 is expanded to include references to video content to be
    used for On (average) mode measurements. Clause 3 is expanded to include additional
    definitions and abbreviations. Clause 4 is expanded to include On (average) mode
    for measuring average television power consumption. Clause 5 is modified to require
    reporting of the power supply voltage and frequency, and the ambient temperature.
    Clause 5 also includes updated requirements regarding the power measurement instrument.
    Subclause 6.7 is updated to indicate that is it maintained for backward compatibility.
    Clause 11 is newly added. It describes the methods for measuring On (average)
    mode television power. Annex B is newly added. It describes considerations for
    measuring On (average) mode television power. Annex C is newly added. It describes
    the video signals to be used for measuring On (average) mode television power.<br
