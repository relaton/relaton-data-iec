abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 21425:2017 describes extensions to the C++ Programming Language
    (2) that permit operations on ranges of data. These extensions include changes
    and additions to the existing library facilities as well as the extension of one
    core language facility. In particular, changes and extensions to the Standard
    Library include:<br />\r\n- The formulation of the foundational and iterator concept
    requirements using the syntax of the Concepts TS (2).<br />\r\n- Analogues of
    the Standard Library algorithms specified in terms of the new concepts.<br />\r\n-
    The loosening of the algorithm constraints to permit the use of sentinels to denote
    the end of a range and corresponding changes to algorithm return types where necessary.<br
    />\r\n- The addition of new concepts describing range and view abstractions; that
    is, objects with a begin iterator and an end sentinel.<br />\r\n- New algorithm
    overloads that take range objects.<br />\r\n- Support of callable objects (as
    opposed to function objects) passed as arguments to the algorithms.<br />\r\n-
    The addition of optional projection arguments to the algorithms to permit on-the-fly
    data transformations.<br />\r\n- Analogues of the iterator primitives and new
    primitives in support of the addition of sentinels to the library.<br />\r\n-
    Constrained analogues of the standard iterator adaptors and stream iterators that
    satisfy the new iterator concepts.<br />\r\n- New iterator adaptors (counted_iterator
    and common_iterator) and sentinels (unreachable).<br />\r\nChanges to the core
    language include:<br />\r\n- the extension of the range-based for statement to
    support the new iterator range requirements (10.4).<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 21425:2017
    does not specify constrained analogues of other parts of the Standard Library
    (e.g., the numeric algorithms), nor does it add range support to all the places
    that could benefit from it (e.g., the containers).<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 21425:2017
    does not specify any new range views, actions, or facade or adaptor utilities;
    all are left as future work."
