abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62647-4:2018(E) defines the requirements for replacing solder balls
    on ball grid array (BGA) component packages in the context of an electronic components
    management plan (ECMP) for aerospace, defence and high reliability products. The
    intent of this document is to provide re-balling companies (hereinafter referred
    to as the re-balling provider) with the administrative and technical requirements
    to be incorporated within existing processes or for establishing, implementing
    and maintaining a new set of processes or the creation of a stand-alone re-balling
    process.
