abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23002-5:2017 describes:<br />\r\n- what is meant by conformance
    of what is specified in ISO/IEC 23002‑4,<br />\r\n- the structure of the reference
    software related to what is specified in ISO/IEC 23002‑4.<br />\r\nCurrently the
    following profiles are included in ISO/IEC 23002‑4 and in this document as reference
    software:<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC 14496‑2 Simple Profile,<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC 14496‑10
    Constrained Baseline Profile,<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC 14496‑10 Progressive High Profile,<br
    />\r\n- ISO/IEC 14496‑16 SC3DMC, and<br />\r\n- ISO/IEC 23008‑2 Main Profile.<br
    />\r\nNOTE The reference software supports the decoding of bitstreams that conform
    to the Main Profile of ISO/IEC 23008‑2, but does not support display-related features
    indicated in supplemental enhancement information (the support for which is a
    display capability that is outside the scope of ISO/IEC 23008‑2)."
