    <p>This Technical Report describes the functions that may be supported by systems using ISO/IEC 16500. These</p>
    <p>functions have been derived by analyzing the requirements of a number of example applications from the</p>
    <p>viewpoints of a range of participants, including:</p>
    <p>_ content providers _ IPR holders</p>
    <p>_ service providers _ rights collection agencies</p>
    <p>_ delivery system providers _ regulatory authorities</p>
    <p>_ end-users _ business support services</p>
    <p>_ equipment manufacturers _ financial services</p>
    <p>Applications, tools and functions are described from a behavioral viewpoint. The report does not assume any</p>
    <p>technical implementation for a particular service.</p>
    <p>The Technical Report consists of a main body, and a series of Annexes. The main body introduces the concept of</p>
    <p>a contour in the context of ISO/IEC 16500 and outlines its use in compliance and conformance definitions. The</p>
    <p>behaviour and parameters of sets of core functions and generic tools that can be derived from the functions are</p>
    <p>then presented. Nineteeen example applications are analysed and described in terms of generic and application</p>
    <p>specific functionalities. The main body concludes with an integrated summary listing of the functionalities</p>
    <p>required by users and providers of digital audio-visual applications and systems organised under a set of</p>
    <p>functional groupings . The User and Market Requirements and the corresponding Functional Requirements</p>
    <p>required for the IDB (Interactive Digital Broadcast) contour are defined in Annex A. Similar information is</p>
    <p>provided in Annex B for the EDB (Enhanced Digital Broadcast) contour. This overall structure is designed to</p>
    <p>readily incorporate future descriptions of new core functions, generic tools, sample applications and additional</p>
    <p>contours.</p>
