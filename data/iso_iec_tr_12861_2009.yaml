abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 12861:2009 is one of a series of publications that explore
    IP-based enterprise communication involving Corporate telecommunication Networks
    (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks) and in particular Next Generation Corporate
    Networks (NGCN). The series particularly focuses on inter-domain communication,
    including communication between parts of the same enterprise, between enterprises
    and between enterprises and carriers. ISO/IEC TR 12861:2009 discusses issues related
    to user identities and routing and builds upon concepts introduced in ISO/IEC
    TR 12860.</p>"
