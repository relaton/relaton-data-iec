abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC TR 12861:2009 is one of
    a series of publications that explore IP-based enterprise communication involving
    Corporate telecommunication Networks (CNs) (also known as enterprise networks)
    and in particular Next Generation Corporate Networks (NGCN). The series particularly
    focuses on inter-domain communication, including communication between parts of
    the same enterprise, between enterprises and between enterprises and carriers.
    ISO/IEC TR 12861:2009 discusses issues related to user identities and routing
    and builds upon concepts introduced in ISO/IEC TR 12860.</p>
