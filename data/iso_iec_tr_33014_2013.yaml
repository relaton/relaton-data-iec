abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 33014:2013 provides informative guidance on using process
    assessment as part of a complete framework and method for performing process improvement
    as part of a continual improvement activity. It also provides guidance on how
    to strengthen and maintain the abilities to ensure success with continual process
    improvement - improvability. Improvability is addressed both at the organizational
    perspective and at the project perspective.</p><p>In the case of process improvement,
    the concepts and principles are appropriate for the full range of different business
    goals, application domains and sizes of organization, so that all types of organizations
    may use them. It is the same in the case of process improvability.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 33014:2013 deals with process improvement on three levels.</p><ul><li>Strategic:
    what goals to achieve, the motivation and direction.</li><li>Tactical: how to
    achieve the goals of process improvement.</li><li>Operational: how to perform
    the process improvement.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC TR 33014:2013 has three improvement
    perspectives.</p><ol><li>Process perspective: Process improvement as a programme
    or project.</li><li>Organizational perspective: Improvement of organizational
    improvability in order to ensure success with improvement projects.</li><li>Project
    perspective: Improve a projectÂ´s improvability and reach improvement success.</li></ol><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 33014:2013 includes topics such as: utilising the results of a process assessment;
    principles of continual process improvement; roles in process improvement; principles
    of enhancing improvability; process improvement support elements; overall change
    strategies; scope of change;</p><p>Although the focus for ISO/IEC TR 33014:2013
    is continual process improvement based on using process assessment as part of
    a complete framework and method for performing and ensuring success with continual
    process improvement, it can also be used in related areas.</p>"
