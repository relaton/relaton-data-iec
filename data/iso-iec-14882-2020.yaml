    <p>This document specifies requirements for implementations of the C++ programming language. The first such requirement is that they implement the language, so this document also defines C++. Other requirements</p>
    <p>and relaxations of the first requirement appear at various places within this document.</p>
    <p> C++ is a general purpose programming language based on the C programming language as described in</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 9899:2018 <i>Programming languages — C </i>(hereinafter referred to as the <i>C standard</i>). C++ provides</p>
    <p>many facilities beyond those provided by C, including additional data types, classes, templates, exceptions,</p>
    <p>namespaces, operator overloading, function name overloading, references, free store management operators,</p>
    <p>and additional library facilities.</p>
