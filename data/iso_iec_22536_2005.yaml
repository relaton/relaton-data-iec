abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 22536:2005 is part of a suite of standards that specify tests for
    ISO/IEC 18092. It defines test methods for the RF-interface. ISO/IEC 22536:2005
    specifies RF-test methods for NFC devices with antennas fitting within the rectangular
    area of 85 mm by 54 mm.This test standard, the first of two parts, specifies compliance
    tests for the RF interface of ISO/IEC 18092 devices. The companion test standard
    specifies protocol tests for ISO/IEC 18092.Ecma purposefully aligned this International
    Standard with ISO/IEC 10373-6 to allow testing laboratories to reuse equipment
    and expertise.
