    /><br />\r\nIEC 61196-5:2022, which is a sectional specification, applies to coaxial
    cables for analogue and digital one- and two-way signal transmission, for example
    for cable networks for television signals, sound signals and interactive services
    in accordance with IEC 60728-1, IEC 60728-1-1, IEC 60728-101, IEC 60728-10, ISO/IEC
    11801-1 and ISO/IEC 11801-4. This includes also the transmission of BCT signals
    provided by a CATV, MATV or SMATV cable networks.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    the test procedures and requirements for trunk and distribution cables for temperatures
    between −40 °C and +65 °C and in the frequency range of 5 MHz to 2 000 MHz.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2018. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
