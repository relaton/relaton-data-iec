  content: "IEC 60404-8-5:2020(E) defines the grades of electrical steel strip and
    sheet with specified mechanical properties and magnetic polarization. In particular,
    it gives general requirements, mechanical properties, magnetic polarization, geometric
    characteristics, tolerances and technological characteristics, as well as inspection
    procedures.<br />\r\nThis document applies to electrical steel strip and sheet
    intended for the construction of poles and rims of rotating electrical machines.<br
    />\r\nThe grades are grouped into two classes according to their manufacturing
    process:<br />\r\n- hot-rolled grades;<br />\r\n- cold-rolled grades.<br />\r\nThey
    correspond to Class D21 of IEC 60404-1.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    extension of the range of products to include the improved grades;<br />\r\nb)
    division of \"flatness\" into \"edge wave (wave factor)\" and \"residual curvature\"
    in consistent with IEC 60404-9;<br />\r\nc) change length of test specimen for
    determinations of geometrical characters from 2 m to 1 m."
