abstract:
- content: "IEC 60433:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60433:2021 is applicable
    to string insulator units of the long rod type with insulating parts of ceramic
    material intended for use in AC overhead power lines with a nominal voltage greater
    than 1000 V and a frequency not greater than 100 Hz. It is also applicable to
    insulators of similar design, used in substations. This document is applicable
    to ceramic string insulator units of the long rod type, either with a clevis end
    fitting at both ends for coupling with a tongue, or with a socket end fitting
    at both ends for coupling with a pin ball. The object of this document is to prescribe
    specified values for electrical and mechanical characteristics, and for the principal
    dimensions of ceramic string insulator units of the long rod type. This fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 1998. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- wording in Scope changed from \"should\" to \"are intended
    to\";<br />\r\n- new normative references added;<br />\r\n- title of Clause 4
    amended, new Note 4 added;<br />\r\n- Table 1 expanded to include more specified
    mechanical failing loads.</p>"
