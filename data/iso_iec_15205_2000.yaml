abstract:
- content: An input&#x2F;output expansion bus with a 32- or 64-bit width is described
    in this standard. The SBus is designed for systems requiring a small number expansion
    ports. SBus Cards may be connected to a standard Sbus Connector mounted on the
    motherboard. SBus Devices may also be attached to the SBus directly on the system&#x27;s
    motherboard. The dimensions of the SBus Card are 83,8 mm by 146,7 mm, making the
    cards appropriate for small computer systems that make extensive use of highly
    integrated circuits. The SBus Cards are designed to be installed in a plane parallel
    to the system&#x27;s motherboard as mezzanine cards. They are designed to provide
    connections for devices external to the computer system through an exposed back
    panel. The form factor is useful in Futurebus+, VMEbus, desktop computers, and
    similar applications. The SBus has the capability of transferring data at rates
    up to 168 Mbytes&#x2F;s, depending on the implementation options selected. SBus
    Cards may either serve as Masters on the bus, providing all virtual address information
    as well as the data to be transferred, or they may serve as Slaves on the bus,
    providing data transfer according to the requirements of some other SBus Master.
    The SBus Master for a data transfer is selected by an arbitration process managed
    by the single SBus Controller on the SBus. The SBus Controller provides a virtual
    to physical address translation service.
