    descriptions for describing the life cycle of systems created by humans, defining
    a set of processes and associated terminology from an engineering viewpoint. These
    processes can be applied to systems of interest, their system elements, and to
    systems of systems. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout
    the stages of a system''s life cycle. This is accomplished through the involvement
    of stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This
    document defines a set of processes to facilitate system development and information
    exchange among acquirers, suppliers, and other stakeholders in the life cycle
    of a system.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document specifies processes that support the definition, control,
    and improvement of the system life cycle processes used within an organization
    or a project. Organizations and projects can use these processes when acquiring
    and supplying systems.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align:
    none; text-autospace: none;">This document applies to organizations in their roles
    as both acquirers and suppliers.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align:
    none; text-autospace: none;">This document applies to the full life cycle of systems,
    including conception, development, production, utilization, support and retirement
    of systems, and to the acquisition and supply of systems, whether performed internally
    or externally to an organization. The life cycle processes of this document can
    be applied iteratively and concurrently to a system and recursively to the system
    elements.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document applies to one-of-a-kind systems, mass-produced systems,
    and customised, adaptable systems. It also applies to a complete stand-alone system
    and to systems that are embedded and integrated into larger more complex and complete
    systems.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document does not prescribe a specific system life cycle model, development
    methodology, method, modelling approach or technique.</p><p class="MsoBodyText"
    style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This document does
    not detail information items in terms of name, format, explicit content, and recording
    media. ISO/IEC/IEEE 15289 addresses the content for life cycle process information
    items (documentation).</p>'
