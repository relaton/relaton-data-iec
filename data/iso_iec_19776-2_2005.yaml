abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 19775, Extensible 3D (X3D), defines a system that integrates 3D
    graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space
    that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through
    a variety of mechanisms. ISO/IEC 19776-2:2004 defines a mapping of the abstract
    objects in X3D to a specific encoding using the technique defined in ISO/IEC 14772.   Each
    Classic VRML-encoded X3D file:    supports all of the purposes of X3D files defined
    in ISO/IEC 19775; and   encodes X3D constructs in Classic VRML format.      A
    Classic VRML-encoded X3D file may be referenced from files using other encodings
    and may itself reference other X3D files encoded using other encodings. Such files
    can only be processed by browsers which conform to all of the utilized encodings.'
