abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19775, Extensible 3D (X3D), defines a system that integrates 3D
    graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space
    that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through
    a variety of mechanisms. ISO/IEC 19776-2:2004 defines a mapping of the abstract
    objects in X3D to a specific encoding using the technique defined in ISO/IEC 14772.<br
    /><br />\r\nEach Classic VRML-encoded X3D file:<br />\r\nsupports all of the purposes
    of X3D files defined in ISO/IEC 19775; and<br />\r\nencodes X3D constructs in
    Classic VRML format.<br /><br />\r\nA Classic VRML-encoded X3D file may be referenced
    from files using other encodings and may itself reference other X3D files encoded
    using other encodings. Such files can only be processed by browsers which conform
    to all of the utilized encodings."
