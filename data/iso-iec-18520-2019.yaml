    <p>This document identifies the reference framework for the benchmarking of vision-based spatial registration and tracking (vSRT) methods for mixed and augmented reality (MAR).</p>
    <p>The framework provides typical benchmarking processes, benchmark indicators and trial set elements that are necessary to successfully identify, define, design, select and apply benchmarking of vSRT methods for MAR. It also provides definitions for terms on benchmarking of vSRT methods for MAR.</p>
    <p>In addition, this document provides a conformance checklist as a tool to clarify how each benchmarking activity conforms to this document in a compact form by declaring which benchmarking processes and benchmark indicators are included and what types of trial sets are used in each benchmarking activity.</p>
