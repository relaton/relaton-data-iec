abstract:
- content: "<p>The computer graphics interface (CGI) (ISO/IEC 9636) specifies a language
    independent standard interface between device-independent and device-dependent
    parts of a graphics system. For integration in a programming language, CGI is
    embedded in a language dependent layer obeying the particular conventions of that
    language. Specifies such a language dependent layer for the Ada programming language.</p>"
