abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-60:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-60:2023 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-60:2017
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-60:2023 deals with the safety of electric whirlpool baths
    for indoor use and whirlpool spas, for household and similar use, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other
    appliances, including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances. This standard also applies to appliances for circulating air or water
    in conventional baths. This standard applies to factory-built self-contained whirlpool
    baths or whirlpool spas in which all controls and components are integral parts
    of the appliance and are located within or affixed to the whirlpool bath or whirlpool
    spa structure. Appliances not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless
    can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used
    by laymen in hotels, fitness centres and similar places, are within the scope
    of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common
    hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around
    the home. However, in general, it does not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons
    (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of
    experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely without
    supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national water supply authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- equipment for water circulation
    in swimming and motion exercise pools;<br />\r\n- cleaning appliances for swimming
    pools;<br />\r\n- appliances intended for medical purposes (IEC 60601 series);<br
    />\r\n- field-engineered, non-self-contained permanently installed whirlpool baths
    or whirlpool spas custom designed to fit a specific location, being assembled
    or constructed at the final installation location;<br />\r\n- appliances intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2017. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes to normative
    text (Clause 1, 7.12.1);<br />\r\nc) addition of hyperthermia instructions and
    installation instructions related to the wiring rules (7.12, 7.12.1);<br />\r\nd)
    modifications related to IEC 60364-7-702 and transportable whirlpool spas (Clause
    1, 5.101, 6.1, 6.2, 7.12.1, 7.15, 13.1, 13.2, 16.1, 16.2, 22.33, 22.107, 25.1);<br
    />\r\ne) introduction of surface temperature limits (Clause 11);<br />\r\nf) addition
    of water temperature limit at the suction/return openings (11.8, 11.101);<br />\r\ng)
    modification to the tests of 19.2 and 19.3 specifying the types of devices that
    are rendered inoperative.<br />\r\nh) addition of requirement for thermal cut-outs
    to be trip free (24.101).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
