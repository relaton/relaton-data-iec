    This basic standard establishes the immunity requirements and a
    common reference for evaluating in a laboratory the performance of
    electrical and electronic equipment intended for residential,
    commercial and industrial application, as well as of equipment
    intended for electrical stations, as applicable.
    The purpose of this standard is to define:

    - test voltage and current waveforms;

    - ranges of test levels;

    - test equipment;

    - test set-up;

    - test procedure.
