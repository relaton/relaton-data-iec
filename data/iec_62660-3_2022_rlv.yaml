abstract:
- content: "IEC 62660-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62660-3:2022
    specifies test procedures and acceptance criteria for safety performance of secondary
    lithium-ion cells and cell blocks used for propulsion of electric vehicles (EV)
    including battery electric vehicles (BEV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV).
    This document determines the basic safety performance of cells used in a battery
    pack and system under intended use and reasonably foreseeable misuse or incident,
    during the normal operation of the EV. The safety requirements of the cell in
    this document are based on the premise that the cells are properly used in a battery
    pack and system within the limits for voltage, current and temperature as specified
    by the cell manufacturer (cell operating region)."
