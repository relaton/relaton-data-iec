  content: IEC/TR 62725:2013(E) is intended to provide users with guidance to understand
    methodologies and to evaluate carbon footprint of products (hereinafter referred
    to as CFP), by quantifying the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions (hereinafter referred
    to as CFP study) for Electrical and Electronic products (hereinafter referred
    to as EE products) based on life-cycle thinking. It is applicable to any type
    of EE products, which are new or modified (e.g. reconditioned, upgraded, etc.)
    and is based on the result of a comparative study on existing methodologies published
    or under discussion in representative international organizations.
