abstract:
- content: "As the fourth industrial revolution advances – merging physical, digital,
    and biological domains – the industrial metaverse is poised to become a transformative
    platform. The virtual platform could host digital twins of real-world assets,
    enabling enhanced efficiency, predictive simulations.<br /><br />\r\nThe IEC Societal
    and technological trend report explores the emerging landscape of the industrial
    metaverse, highlighting the gap in current standardization efforts which predominantly
    focus on consumer applications.<br /><br />\r\nWhile organizations such as IEC,
    ITU, ISO, IEEE, and the Metaverse Standards Forum are actively analyzing metaverse
    technologies, only a few standardization deliverables address industrial use cases
    or monetization strategies.<br /><br />\r\nThe industrial metaverse promises significant
    benefits: reduced costs in product design, testing and manufacturing, while improving
    product quality, and streamlining services. Its unified digital ecosystem could
    yield economic, environmental, and social advantages and opportunities. The authors
    argue that when leveraged efficiently, the technology can also advance several
    UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).<br /><br />\r\nHowever, critical challenges
    persist, particularly in areas such as privacy, ownership, safety, sustainability,
    and monetization. In consumer space, for instance, adoption is slowed by reluctance
    to pay for metaverse-based services.<br /><br />\r\nThis report identifies key
    challenges and opportunities within the industrial metaverse, outlines relevant
    economic and business models, maps the value chain, and defines the value proposition.
    It also presents industry perspectives on overcoming standardization hurdles from
    both market and operational standpoints, offering a foundation for future development
    and collaboration.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC societal and technology trend report
    was developed by the Metaverse Sub-Working Group (SWG 20) of the Societal and
    Technology Trend Working Group (STTWG) in the IEC Market Strategy Board (MSB).<br
    /><br />\r\nThis IEC STTR is available for free download."
