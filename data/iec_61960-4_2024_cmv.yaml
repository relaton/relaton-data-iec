abstract:
- content: "<p>IEC 61960-4:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61960-4:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 61960-4:2020
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 21A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61960-4:2024 specifies performance tests, designations, markings,
    dimensions and other requirements for coin secondary lithium cells and batteries
    for portable applications, watches, and backup power supply such as memory backup
    applications. In particular, watch‑specific requirements are specified in Annex
    A. This document provides purchasers and users of coin secondary lithium cells
    and batteries with a set of criteria with which they can assess the performance
    of coin secondary lithium cells and batteries offered by various manufacturers.
    This document defines a minimum required level of performance and a standardized
    methodology by which testing is performed and the results of this testing are
    reported to the user. This document covers coin secondary lithium cells and batteries
    with a range of chemistries. Each electrochemical couple has a characteristic
    voltage range over which, during discharge, it releases its electrical capacity,
    a characteristic nominal voltage and a characteristic end‑of‑discharge voltage.
    Users of coin secondary lithium cells and batteries are requested to consult the
    manufacturer for advice. This document also provides guidelines for designers
    of equipment using lithium batteries (voir l'Annexe B).</p>"
