abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 16167:2011 discusses issues related to emergency calls from an enterprise user
    to a safety answering point (SAP) using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)
    within a Next Generation Corporate Network (NGCN). A SAP can be either a public
    safety answering point (PSAP) or a private emergency answering point (PEAP). ISO/IEC
    TR 16167:2011 uses terminology and concepts developed in ISO/IEC TR 12860. It
    identifies a number of requirements impacting Next Generation Network standardization
    and concerning deployment of enterprise networks.<br />\r\nThe scope of ISO/IEC
    TR 16167:2011 is limited to calls from a user of an enterprise network to an authority,
    where the authority is represented by a SAP (PSAP or PEAP). This includes the
    special case where a PEAP acts as an enterprise user in making an emergency call
    to a PSAP. Authority to authority calls, authority to enterprise user calls and
    enterprise user to enterprise user calls within the context of an emergency are
    out of scope, with the exception of return calls and verification calls as follow-up
    to an emergency call from the user to an authority."
