abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 16167:2011 discusses issues related to emergency calls from
    an enterprise user to a safety answering point (SAP) using the Session Initiation
    Protocol (SIP) within a Next Generation Corporate Network (NGCN). A SAP can be
    either a public safety answering point (PSAP) or a private emergency answering
    point (PEAP). ISO/IEC TR 16167:2011 uses terminology and concepts developed in
    ISO/IEC TR 12860. It identifies a number of requirements impacting Next Generation
    Network standardization and concerning deployment of enterprise networks.</p><p>The
    scope of ISO/IEC TR 16167:2011 is limited to calls from a user of an enterprise
    network to an authority, where the authority is represented by a SAP (PSAP or
    PEAP). This includes the special case where a PEAP acts as an enterprise user
    in making an emergency call to a PSAP. Authority to authority calls, authority
    to enterprise user calls and enterprise user to enterprise user calls within the
    context of an emergency are out of scope, with the exception of return calls and
    verification calls as follow-up to an emergency call from the user to an authority.</p>"
