abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15939:2007 defines a measurement process applicable to system
    and software engineering and management disciplines. The process is described
    through a model that defines the activities of the measurement process that are
    required to adequately specify what measurement information is required, how the
    measures and analysis results are to be applied, and how to determine if the analysis
    results are valid. The measurement process is flexible, tailorable, and adaptable
    to the needs of different users.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15939:2007 identifies
    a process that supports defining a suitable set of measures that address specific
    information needs. It identifies the activities and tasks that are necessary to
    successfully identify, define, select, apply and improve measurement within an
    overall project or organizational measurement structure. It also provides definitions
    for measurement terms commonly used within the system and software industries."
