abstract:
- content: "IEC 61557-1:2019+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the general requirements applicable
    to measuring and monitoring equipment for testing the electrical safety in low-voltage
    distribution systems with nominal voltages up to 1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC. When
    measuring equipment or measuring installations involve measurement tasks of various
    measuring equipment covered by this series of standards, then the part of this
    series relevant to each of the measurement tasks is applicable. Other parts of
    IEC 61557 can specify additional requirements or deviations. This document does
    not cover functional safety or cybersecurity. IEC 61557-1:2019 cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This third edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) terms aligned with IEC 60050;<br />\r\nb)
    measurement of uncertainty revised according to the equations in 4.2 of ISO/IEC
    Guide 98-3:2008 (GUM);<br />\r\nc) updated references for safety and EMC requirements;<br
    />\r\nd) updated references for marking and operating instructions;<br />\r\ne)
    updated references for testing safety and EMC;<br />\r\nf) Annex A contains an
    explanation of GUM;<br />\r\ng) Annex B addresses environmental aspects."
