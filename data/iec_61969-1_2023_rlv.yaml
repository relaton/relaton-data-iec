abstract:
- content: "IEC 61969-1:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61969-1:2023
    contains design guidelines for outdoor enclosures for electrical and electronic
    equipment and is applicable over a wide field of mechanical, electromechanical
    and electronic equipment and its installation where a modular design is used.
    The objectives of this document are:<br />\r\n- to provide an overview of specifications
    for enclosures focused on requirements for outdoor applications for stationary
    use at non-weatherprotected locations, and<br />\r\n- to achieve product integrity
    under outdoor conditions and to ease product selection for the sourcing of outdoor
    enclosures from different vendors."
