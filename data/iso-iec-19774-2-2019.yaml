    <p>This document specifies the method of motion capture animation using H-Anim humanoid models. Each humanoid model consists of an articulated character with specified joints and motion capture data. As specified in ISO/IEC 19774-1, each character consists of joints and segments in a hierarchical structure.</p>
    <p>This document includes the following:</p>
    <p>—          Concepts of motion capture as related to humanoid animation,</p>
    <p>—          Concepts of motion capture data definition,</p>
    <p>—          Definition of motion parameters and motion-capture animation data for transferring or exchanging motion between different humanoid character models,</p>
    <p>—          Mapping the structure of motion capture data to the structure of H-Anim objects,&lt;/li&gt;</p>
    <p>—          HAnim motion capture animation using interpolators,</p>
    <p>—          HAnim motion definition using H-Anim Motion objects, and</p>
    <p>—          A method for generating and specifying an H-Anim motion capture animation.</p>
    <p>This document specifies a standard technique for exchanging humanoid animation using motion capture. It does not mandate using any specific run-time system to render the H-Anim characters or animations.&lt;/p&gt;</p>
