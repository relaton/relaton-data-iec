    <p>ISO/IEC 15504-6:2013 constitutes a Process Assessment Model, conformant with the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2, for the assessment of process capability of system life cycle processes.</p>
    <p>The Process Dimension of this Process Assessment Model is based upon the Process Reference Model contained in ISO/IEC 15288.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15504-6:2013 provides a new Process Dimension for the Process Assessment Model derived from the revised Process Reference Model contained in ISO/IEC 15288:2008.</p>
    <p>The scope of ISO/IEC 15504-6:2013 is consistent with the scope of ISO/IEC 15504-5 in order to assist situations where assessment is being made of both system and software life cycle processes.</p>
    <p>Users of ISO/IEC 15504-6:2013 may freely reproduce the detailed descriptions contained in the exemplar assessment model as part of any tool or other material to support the performance of process assessments, so that it can be used for its intended purpose.</p>
