abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the design and dimensions for two small-bore connectors
    intended to be used for connections in respiratory applications of medical devices
    and accessories. One connector (R1) is intended for use on medical devices and
    accessories subjected to pressures up to 15 kPa (e.g. a breathing system). The
    other connector (R2) is intended for use on medical devices and accessories subjected
    to higher pressures between 15 kPa and 600 kPa (e.g. oxygen therapy tubing).<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 The pressure is related to pressure available at the source to which
    the medical device is connected.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The intended application does
    not preclude the use of other connectors on medical devices or accessories within
    this application.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 Requirements for alternative connectors for
    this intended application are specified in ISO 80369-1.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not specify requirements for the medical devices or accessories that use
    these connectors. Such requirements are given in device-specific standards.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 4 If a device-specific standard does not exist, the performance and
    material requirements specified in ISO 80369-1 can be used as guidance."
