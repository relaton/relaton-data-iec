abstract:
- content: Describes an algorithm for executing of the Standard Wafer Level Electromigration
    Accelerated Test (SWEAT) on computer controlled instrumentation. The algorithm
    described represents one approach to the execution of SWEAT. Development and employment
    of other algorithms may produce satisfactory accelerated electromigration test
    results.
