- content: |-
    <p>ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011 specifies the test methods used for conformity testing, that is methods for determining whether a driving licence can be considered to comply with the requirements of ISO/IEC 18013 for:</p>

    machine readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013-2), and
    access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3).<p>The test methods specified in ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011 are based on specifications defined in ISO/IEC 18013-2 and ISO/IEC 18013-3 and underlying normative specifications.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011 deals with test methods specific to ISO-compliant driving licence (IDL) requirements. Test methods applicable to (smart) cards in general (e.g. those specified in the ISO/IEC 10373 series) are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011.</p><p>Hence, ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011</p>

    provides IDL implementers with requirements for conformity evaluation,
    provides IDL issuing authorities with requirements for quality assurance, and
    provides test laboratories and test tool providers with test suite requirements.
