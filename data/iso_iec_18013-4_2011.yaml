abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011 specifies the test methods used for conformity testing,
    that is methods for determining whether a driving licence can be considered to
    comply with the requirements of ISO/IEC 18013 for:<br /><br />\r\nmachine readable
    technologies (ISO/IEC 18013-2), and<br />\r\naccess control, authentication and
    integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3).<br /><br /><br />\r\nThe test methods
    specified in ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011 are based on specifications defined in ISO/IEC
    18013-2 and ISO/IEC 18013-3 and underlying normative specifications.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 18013-4:2011 deals with test methods specific to ISO-compliant driving
    licence (IDL) requirements. Test methods applicable to (smart) cards in general
    (e.g. those specified in the ISO/IEC 10373 series) are outside the scope of ISO/IEC
    18013-4:2011.<br /><br />\r\nHence, ISO/IEC 18013-4:2011<br /><br />\r\nprovides
    IDL implementers with requirements for conformity evaluation,<br />\r\nprovides
    IDL issuing authorities with requirements for quality assurance, and<br />\r\nprovides
    test laboratories and test tool providers with test suite requirements."
