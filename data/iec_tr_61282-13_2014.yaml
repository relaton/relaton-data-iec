abstract:
- content: 'IEC/TR 61282-13:2014 which is a technical report, presents general information
    about in-service measurements of polarization mode dispersion (PMD) and chromatic
    dispersion (CD) in fibre optic links. It describes the background and need for
    these measurements, the various methods and techniques developed thus far, and
    their possible implementations for practical applications. Key words: polarization
    mode dispersion (PMD), chromatic dispersion (CD), fibre optic links'
