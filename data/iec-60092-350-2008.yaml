    This part of IEC 60092 provides the general constructional requirements and test methods for use in the manufacture of electric power, control and instrumentation cables with copper conductors intended for fixed electrical systems at voltages up to and including 18/30(36) kV on board ships and offshore (mobile and fixed) units. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2001 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    a) the new insulating compounds contained in IEC 60092-351;<br />
    b) the new sheathing compounds contained in IEC 60092-359;<br />
    c) the publication of IEC 60092-376;<br />
    d) the inclusion of cables up to 30 kV in the revision of IEC 60092-354;<br />
    e) for use in a limited number of closely defined applications, the provision to allow the design of a single core cable with a single extrusion covering, having a thickness equal to that of both an insulation and sheath;<br />
    f) new tests for the determination of enhanced cold properties, oil resistance, and resistance to drilling fluids.
