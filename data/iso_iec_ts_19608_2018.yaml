abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides guidance for:</p><p>— selecting and specifying
    security functional requirements (SFRs) from ISO/IEC 15408-2 to protect Personally
    Identifiable Information (PII);</p><p>— the procedure to define both privacy and
    security functional requirements in a coordinated manner; and</p><p>— developing
    privacy functional requirements as extended components based on the privacy principles
    defined in ISO/IEC 29100 through the paradigm described in ISO/IEC 15408-2.</p><p>The
    intended audience for this document are:</p><p>— developers who implement products
    or systems that deal with PII and want to undergo a security evaluation of those
    products using ISO/IEC 15408. They will get guidance how to select security functional
    requirements for the Security Target of their product or system that map to the
    privacy principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100;</p><p>— authors of Protection Profiles
    that address the protection of PII; and</p><p>— evaluators that use ISO/IEC 15408
    and ISO/IEC 18045 for a security evaluation.</p><p>This document is intended to
    be fully consistent with ISO/IEC 15408; however, in the event of any inconsistency
    between this document and ISO/IEC 15408, the latter, as a normative standard,
    takes precedence.</p>"
