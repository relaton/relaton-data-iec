abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 19608:2018 This document provides guidance for:<br />\r\n-
    selecting and specifying security functional requirements (SFRs) from ISO/IEC
    15408-2 to protect Personally Identifiable Information (PII);<br />\r\n- the procedure
    to define both privacy and security functional requirements in a coordinated manner;
    and<br />\r\n- developing privacy functional requirements as extended components
    based on the privacy principles defined in ISO/IEC 29100 through the paradigm
    described in ISO/IEC 15408-2.<br />\r\nThe intended audience for this document
    are:<br />\r\n- developers who implement products or systems that deal with PII
    and want to undergo a security evaluation of those products using ISO/IEC 15408.
    They will get guidance how to select security functional requirements for the
    Security Target of their product or system that map to the privacy principles
    defined in ISO/IEC 29100;<br />\r\n- authors of Protection Profiles that address
    the protection of PII; and<br />\r\n- evaluators that use ISO/IEC 15408 and ISO/IEC
    18045 for a security evaluation.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to be fully
    consistent with ISO/IEC 15408; however, in the event of any inconsistency between
    this document and ISO/IEC 15408, the latter, as a normative standard, takes precedence."
