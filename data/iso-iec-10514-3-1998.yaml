    <p><b>1.1 Goals</b></p>
    <p>In addition to the goals of the Base Language, the goal of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is to</p>
    <p>provide simple extensions to allow object oriented programming facilities to be added to the</p>
    <p>Base Language defined in International Standard ISO/IEC 10514-1 without altering the</p>
    <p>meaning of any valid program allowed by the Base Language (except for the use of the new</p>
    <p>keywords introduced by this standard, see clause 5).</p>
    <p><b>1.2 Specifications included in this part of ISO/IEC 10514</b></p>
    <p>In addition to the specifications included in the Base Language this part of ISO/IEC 10514</p>
    <p>provides specifications for:</p>
    <p>— required symbols for Object Oriented Modula-2 programs;</p>
    <p>— the lexical structure, the syntactic structure and semantics of Object Oriented Modula-2</p>
    <p>programs;</p>
    <p>— the interface to and the semantics of Object Oriented Modula-2 system modules;</p>
    <p>— violations of the rules for the use of the object oriented extensions that a conforming</p>
    <p>implementation is required to detect;</p>
    <p>— further compliance requirements for implementations, including documentation</p>
    <p>requirements.</p>
    <p><b>1.3 Relationship to ISO/IEC 10514-1</b></p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 10514 is part three of the multi-part standard ISO/IEC 10514. This part</p>
    <p>of ISO/IEC 10514 extends and modifies the Base Language ISO/IEC 10514-1, but the</p>
    <p>adoption of this part of ISO/IEC 10514 is optional with respect to the Base Language. This</p>
    <p>part of ISO/IEC 10514 is also independent of any other parts of ISO/IEC 10514 except for</p>
    <p>part 1, and can be adopted either together with or independently of such other parts.</p>
    <p><b>1.4 Specifications not within the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 10514</b></p>
    <p>In addition to the categories of specifications excluded by the Base Language this part of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 10514 provides no specifications for:</p>
    <p>— the internal representation of the objects and their associated methods;</p>
    <p>— the implementation of the garbage collector;</p>
    <p>— the implementation of the tracking mechanism for traced objects.</p>
