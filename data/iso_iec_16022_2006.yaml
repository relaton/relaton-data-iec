abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 16022:2006 defines the requirements for the symbology known
    as Data Matrix. It specifies the Data Matrix symbology characteristics, data character
    encodation, symbol formats, dimensions and print quality requirements, error correction
    rules, decoding algorithm, and user-selectable application parameters.</p><p>It
    applies to all Data Matrix symbols produced by any printing or marking technology.</p><p>Data
    Matrix is a two-dimensional matrix symbology which is made up of nominally square
    modules arranged within a perimeter finder pattern. Though primarily shown and
    described in ISO/IEC 16022:2006 as a dark symbol on light background, Data Matrix
    symbols can also be printed to appear as light on dark.</p><p>Manufacturers of
    bar code equipment and users of the technology require publicly available standard
    symbology specifications to which they can refer when developing equipment and
    application standards. The publication of standardized symbology specifications
    is designed to achieve this.</p>"
