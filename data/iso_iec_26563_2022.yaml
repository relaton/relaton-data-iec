- content: "ISO/IEC 26563:2022 This document, within the context of methods and tools
    that support the configuration management (CM) capability of software and systems
    product line engineering:<br />\r\n- specifies processes for product line CM (the
    processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes);<br
    />\r\n- specifies method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;<br
    />\r\n- specifies tool capabilities that automate or semi-automate tasks and methods.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not concern the processes and capabilities of tools and
    methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products."
