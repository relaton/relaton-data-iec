abstract:
- content: IEC 61156-11:2019 describes cables intended to be used for transmission
    of 1 Gbps over a single twisted pair for office, home and industrial application.
    An example of existing application is 1000BASE-T1, see ISO/IEC TR 11801-9906.
    The transmission characteristics of these cables are specified up to a frequency
    of 600 MHz and at a temperature of 20 Â°C. The cable type recognised is intended
    to be used for shielded channels with a nominal length of 40 m. Possible designs
    are U/FTP, X/UTP and X/FTP, where X stands for F, S or SF. A blank detail specification
    can be found in Annex A. These cables can comprise more than one pair in the event
    that several systems are operated in parallel. In this case, refer to Clause 7
    of this document. The cables covered by this document are intended to operate
    with voltages and currents normally encountered in communication systems. While
    these cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low impedance sources,
    for example, the electric power supplies of public utility mains, they are intended
    to be used to support the delivery of low-voltage remote powering applications.
