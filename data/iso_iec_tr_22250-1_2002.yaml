abstract:
- content: "<p>This Technical Report gives mechanisms for formally specifying the
    syntax of XML-based languages. For</p><p>example, the syntax of XHTML 1.0 can
    be specified in RELAX.</p><p>Compared with DTDs, RELAX provides the following
    advantages:</p><p>- Specification in RELAX uses XML instance (i.e., document)
    syntax,</p><p>- RELAX provides rich datatypes, and</p><p>- RELAX is namespace-aware.</p><p>The
    RELAX specification consists of two parts,<em>RELAX Core</em>and<em>RELAX Namespace</em>.
    This part of the Technical</p><p>Report gives<em>RELAX Core,</em>which may be
    used to describe markup languages containing a single XML namespace.</p><p>Part
    2 of this Technical Report gives<em>RELAX Namespace</em>, which may be used to
    describe markup languages</p><p>containing more than a single XML namespace, consisting
    of more than one<em>RELAX Core</em>document.</p><p>Given a sequence of elements,
    a software module called the<em>RELAX Core</em>processor compares it against a</p><p>specification
    in<em>RELAX Core</em>and reports the result. The<em>RELAX Core</em>processor can
    be directly invoked by the</p><p>user, and can also be invoked by another software
    module called the<em>RELAX Namespace</em>processor.</p><p>RELAX may be used in
    conjunction with DTDs. In particular, notations and entities declared by DTDs
    can be</p><p>constrained by RELAX.</p><p>This part of the Technical Report also
    gives a subset of<em>RELAX Core</em>, which is restricted to DTD features plus</p><p>datatypes.
    This subset is very easy to implement, and with the exception of datatype information,
    conversion</p><p>between this subset and XML DTDs results in no information loss.</p><p>NOTE
    1 Since XML is a subset of WebSGML (TC2 of ISO 8879), RELAX is applicable to SGML.</p><p>NOTE
    2 A successor of RELAX Core is being developed at the RELAX NG TC of OASIS.</p>"
