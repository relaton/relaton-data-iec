abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 25010:2023 This document defines a product quality model, which
    is applicable to ICT (information and communication technology) products and software
    products. The product quality model is composed of nine characteristics (which
    are further subdivided into subcharacteristics) that relate to quality properties
    of the products. The characteristics and subcharacteristics provide a reference
    model for the quality of the products to be specified, measured and evaluated.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 1 In this document, a product refers to an ICT product that is part
    of an information system. ICT product components include subsystems, software,
    firmware, hardware, data, communication infrastructure, and other elements that
    are part of the ICT product.<br />\r\nThis model can be used for requirements
    specification and evaluation of the target productsâ€™ quality throughout their
    lifecycle by several stakeholders, including developers, acquirers, quality assurance
    and control staff and independent evaluators. Activities in the product lifecycle
    that can benefit from the use of this model include:<br />\r\n- eliciting and
    defining product and information system requirements;<br />\r\n- validating the
    comprehensiveness of requirements definition;<br />\r\n- identifying product and
    information system design objectives, and design necessary process for achieving
    quality;<br />\r\n- identifying product and information system testing objectives;<br
    />\r\n- identifying quality control criteria as the part of quality assurance;<br
    />\r\n- identifying acceptance criteria for a product and/or an information system;<br
    />\r\n- establishing measures of product quality characteristics in support of
    these activities.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Usage of the quality model for measurement is
    explained in Annex C."
