abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document defines a product quality model,
    which is applicable to ICT (information and communication technology) products
    and software products. The product quality model is composed of nine characteristics
    (which are further subdivided into subcharacteristics) that relate to quality
    properties of the products. The characteristics and subcharacteristics provide
    a reference model for the quality of the products to be specified, measured and
    evaluated.</p><p class="Note">NOTE 1 In this document, a product refers to an
    ICT product that is part of an information system. ICT product components include
    subsystems, software, firmware, hardware, data, communication infrastructure,
    and other elements that are part of the ICT product.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    model can be used for requirements specification and evaluation of the target
    products’ quality throughout their lifecycle by several stakeholders, including
    developers, acquirers, quality assurance and control staff and independent evaluators.
    Activities in the product lifecycle that can benefit from the use of this model
    include:</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->eliciting
    and defining product and information system requirements;</p><p class="ListContinue1"

    the comprehensiveness of requirements definition;</p><p class="ListContinue1"

    Annex C.</p>'
