abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017 specifies the concepts, framework, test methods,
    and criteria required to test conformity of biometric products claiming conformance
    to BioAPI (see ISO/IEC 19784-1). Guidelines for specifying BioAPI conformance
    test suites, writing test assertions, and defining procedures to be followed during
    the conformance testing are provided.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017 is concerned
    with conformance testing of biometric products claiming conformance to BioAPI
    (see ISO/IEC 19784-1). It is not concerned with testing other characteristics
    of biometric products or other types of testing of biometric products (i.e. acceptance,
    performance, robustness, security, etc.) Testing by means of test methods, which
    are specific to particular biometric products, are not the subject of ISO/IEC
    24709-1:2017.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24709-1:2017 is applicable to the development and
    use of conformance test method specifications, BioAPI conformance test suites,
    and conformance testing programs for BioAPI-conformant products. It is intended
    primarily for use by testing organizations, but can be applied by developers and
    users of test assertions and test method implementations.</p>"
