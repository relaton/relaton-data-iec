abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-18-3:2011(E) includes the device definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred
    to herein as RAServer Device. The RAServer Device is a UPnP Device UPnP device
    that allows control points to configure Remote Access Servers. This Device provides
    control points with the following functionality:<br/> \n- Determine if the Remote
    Access Server is reachable from the public Internet;<br/> \n- Enable a Remote
    Access Server to be reachable from the public Internet;<br/> \n- Enumerate the
    Remote Access Transport mechanisms supported by the Remote Access Server;<br/>
    \n- Enumerate the Credentials Delivery mechanisms supported by the Remote Access
    Server;<br/> \n- Configure active Remote Access Transport profiles;<br/> \n- Configure
    filters for allowing which local Devices are visible in remote networks;<br/>
    \n- Configure filters for allowing which remote Devices are visible in the local
    network;<br/> \n- Maintains list of registered remote users, and authenticates
