    points with the following functionality:<br />\r\n- Determine if the Remote Access
    Server is reachable from the public Internet;<br />\r\n- Enable a Remote Access
    Server to be reachable from the public Internet;<br />\r\n- Enumerate the Remote
    Access Transport mechanisms supported by the Remote Access Server;<br />\r\n-
    Enumerate the Credentials Delivery mechanisms supported by the Remote Access Server;<br
    />\r\n- Configure active Remote Access Transport profiles;<br />\r\n- Configure
    filters for allowing which local Devices are visible in remote networks;<br />\r\n-
    Configure filters for allowing which remote Devices are visible in the local network;<br
