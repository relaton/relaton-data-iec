abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document specifies the information model for
    representing the mixed and augmented reality (MAR) scene/contents description,
    namely, information constructs for:</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->a)<!--[endif]-->representing the virtual
    reality scene graph and structure such that a comprehensive range of mixed and
    augmented reality contents can also be represented;</p><p class="ListNumber1"
    style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->b)<!--[endif]-->representing
    physical objects in the mixed and augmented reality scene targeted for augmentation;</p><p
    class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->c)<!--[endif]-->representing
    physical objects as augmentation to other (virtual or physical) objects in the
    mixed and augmented reality scene;</p><p class="ListNumber1" style="mso-list:

    associate aforementioned physical objects with the corresponding target objects
    (virtual or physical) in the mixed and augmented reality scene;</p><p class="ListNumber1"
    style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->e)<!--[endif]-->providing
    other necessary functionalities and abstractions that will support the dynamic
    MAR scene description such as event/data mapping, and dynamic augmentation behaviours;</p><p

    the association between these constructs and the MAR system which is responsible
    for taking and interpreting this information model and rendering/presenting it
