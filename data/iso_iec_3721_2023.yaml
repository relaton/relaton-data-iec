abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 3721:2023 This document specifies the information model for representing
    the mixed and augmented reality (MAR) scene/contents description, namely, information
    constructs for:<br />\r\na) representing the virtual reality scene graph and structure
    such that a comprehensive range of mixed and augmented reality contents can also
    be represented;<br />\r\nb) representing physical objects in the mixed and augmented
    reality scene targeted for augmentation;<br />\r\nc) representing physical objects
    as augmentation to other (virtual or physical) objects in the mixed and augmented
    reality scene;<br />\r\nd) providing ways to spatially associate aforementioned
    physical objects with the corresponding target objects (virtual or physical) in
    the mixed and augmented reality scene;<br />\r\ne) providing other necessary functionalities
    and abstractions that will support the dynamic MAR scene description such as event/data
    mapping, and dynamic augmentation behaviours;<br />\r\nf) describing the association
    between these constructs and the MAR system which is responsible for taking and
    interpreting this information model and rendering/presenting it out through the
    MAR display device."
