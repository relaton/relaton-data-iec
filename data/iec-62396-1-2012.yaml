  content: "IEC 62396-1:2012(E) is intended to provide guidance on atmospheric radiation
    effects on avionics electronics used in aircraft operating at altitudes up to
    60 000 feet (18,3 km). It defines the radiation environment, the effects of that
    environment on electronics and provides design considerations for the accommodation
    of those effects within avionics systems. This International Standard is intended
    to help aerospace equipment manufacturers and designers to standardise their approach
    to single event effects in avionics by providing guidance, leading to a standard
    methodology. This International Standard includes the following technical changes
    with respect to the previous Technical Specification:<br />\r\n- Guidance has
    been provided on the environment for altitudes above 60 000 feet (18,3 km) and
    the effects on electronics are documented;<br />\r\n- a new Annex has been added
    to provide late news as of 2011 on SEE cross-sections applicable to the atmospheric
    neutron environment. Keywords: avionics, atmospheric radiation, electronic equipment"
