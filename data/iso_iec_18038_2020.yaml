abstract:
- content: "This document defines the framework and information reference model for
    representing sensor-based 3D mixed-reality worlds. It defines concepts, an information
    model, architecture, system functions, and how to integrate 3D virtual worlds
    and physical sensors in order to provide mixed-reality applications with physical
    sensor interfaces. It defines an exchange format necessary for transferring and
    storing data between physical sensor-based mixed-reality applications.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies the following functionalities:<br />\r\na) representation of
    physical sensors in a 3D scene;<br />\r\nb) definition of physical sensors in
    a 3D scene;<br />\r\nc) representation of functionalities of each physical sensor
    in a 3D scene;<br />\r\nd) representation of physical properties of each physical
    sensor in a 3D scene;<br />\r\ne) management of physical sensors in a 3D scene;<br
    />\r\nf) interface with physical sensor information in a 3D scene.<br />\r\nThis
    document defines a reference model for physical sensor-based mixed-reality applications
    to represent and to exchange functions of physical sensors in 3D scenes. It does
    not define specific physical interfaces necessary for manipulating physical devices,
    but rather defines common functional interfaces that can be used interchangeably
    between applications.<br />\r\nThis document does not define how specific applications
    are implemented with specific physical sensor devices. It does not include computer
    generated sensor information using computer input/output devices such as a mouse
    or a keyboard. The sensors in this document represent physical sensor devices
    in the real world."
