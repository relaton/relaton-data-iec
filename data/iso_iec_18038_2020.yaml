- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This document defines the framework
    and information reference model for representing sensor-based 3D mixed-reality
    worlds. It defines concepts, an information model, architecture, system functions,
    and how to integrate 3D virtual worlds and physical sensors in order to provide
    mixed-reality applications with physical sensor interfaces. It defines an exchange
    format necessary for transferring and storing data between physical sensor-based
    mixed-reality applications.</p><p>This document specifies the following functionalities:</p><p>a)
    representation of physical sensors in a 3D scene;</p><p>b) definition of physical
    sensors in a 3D scene;</p><p>c) representation of functionalities of each physical
    sensor in a 3D scene;</p><p>d) representation of physical properties of each physical
    sensor in a 3D scene;</p><p>e) management of physical sensors in a 3D scene;</p><p>f)
    interface with physical sensor information in a 3D scene.</p><p>This document
    defines a reference model for physical sensor-based mixed-reality applications
    to represent and to exchange functions of physical sensors in 3D scenes. It does
    not define specific physical interfaces necessary for manipulating physical devices,
    but rather defines common functional interfaces that can be used interchangeably
    between applications.</p><p>This document does not define how specific applications
    are implemented with specific physical sensor devices. It does not include computer
    generated sensor information using computer input/output devices such as a mouse
    or a keyboard. The sensors in this document represent physical sensor devices
    in the real world.</p>
