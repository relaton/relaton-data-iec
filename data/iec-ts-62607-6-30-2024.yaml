  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-30:2024 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the chemical key control characteristic<br />\r\n- anion concentration<br />\r\nfor
    powder of graphene-based material by<br />\r\n- ion chromatography.<br />\r\nIn
    this document, the measured anions are fluoride, chloride, nitrite, bromide, nitrate,
    sulphate, and phosphate. These anions, present in the extraction solution of graphene-based
    materials, are separated into distinct elution bands on the ion chromatographic
    separation column and subsequently measured using a conductivity detector. Quantification
    of these anions is accomplished by establishing a proportional relationship between
    the measured signal (peak area or peak height) and the concentration of each anion.
    This is achieved by calibrating the system using a series of standards containing
    known amounts of each anion. Subsequently, unknown samples are analysed under
    the same conditions as the standards to determine their anion concentrations.<br
    />\r\n- Powder of graphene-based material addressed by this document includes
    graphene oxide, reduced graphene oxide and functionalized graphene, graphene,
    bilayer graphene, trilayer graphene and few-layer graphene.<br />\r\nNote: This
    document can also be used for other carbonaceous material such as graphite and
    graphite oxide.<br />\r\n- This document targets graphene-based material manufacturers
    and downstream users to guide their material design, production and quality control."
