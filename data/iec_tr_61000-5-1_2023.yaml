abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61000-5-1:2023 which is a technical report, covers general considerations
    and guidelines on mitigation methods aimed at ensuring electromagnetic compatibility
    (EMC) among electrical and electronic apparatus or systems used in industrial,
    commercial, and residential installations. This document is intended for use by
    all using and installing sensitive electrical or electronic installations and
    systems, and equipment with high emission levels that could degrade the overall
    electromagnetic (EM) environment. It applies primarily to new installations, but
    also applies during modifications or enhancements of legacy installations. Specific
    topics, such as recommendations on the design and implementation of the earthing
    system, including the earth electrode and the earth network, the design and implementation
    of bonding apparatus or systems to earth or to the earth network, the selection
    and installation of appropriate cables, and the design and implementation mitigation
    means involving shielded enclosures, high-frequency filters, isolating transformers,
    surge-protective devices, etc., will be addressed in other parts of IEC 61000-5.
    Within this document the fundamental measures will be described. The practices
    presented in this document address the EMC concerns of the installation, not the
    safety aspects of the installation nor the efficient transportation of power within
    the installation. Nevertheless, these two prime objectives are taken into consideration
    in the technical observations concerning EMC. These two primary objectives can
    be implemented concurrently for enhanced EMC of the installed sensitive apparatus
    or systems without conflict by applying the practices presented in this document
    and the relevant safety requirements. It is the responsibility of the designer
    and the installer to select the relevant technique most appropriate to a particular
    installation. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 1996. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. restructuring of clauses and subclauses with amending of technical content;<br
    />\r\nb. alignment of the terminology with other parts of the IEC 61000 series,
    for example with IEC TR 61000-2-5;<br />\r\nc. addition of an overview regarding
    the IEC 61000-5 series in Annex A."
