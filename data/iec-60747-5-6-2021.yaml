  content: "IEC 60747-5-6:2021 specifies the terminology, the essential ratings and
    characteristics, the measuring methods and the quality evaluations of light emitting
    diodes (LEDs) for general industrial applications such as signals, controllers,
    sensors, etc.<br />\r\nLEDs for lighting applications are out of the scope of
    this part of IEC 60747.<br />\r\nLEDs are classified as follows:<br />\r\n- LED
    package;<br />\r\n- LED flat illuminator;<br />\r\n- LED numeric display and alpha-numeric
    display;<br />\r\n- LED dot-matrix display;<br />\r\n- infrared-emitting diode
    (IR LED);<br />\r\n- ultraviolet-emitting diode (UV LED).<br />\r\nLEDs with a
    heat spreader or having a terminal geometry that performs the function of a heat
    spreader are within the scope of this part of IEC 60747.<br />\r\nAn integration
    of LEDs and controlgears, integrated LED modules, semi-integrated LED modules,
    integrated LED lamps or semi-integrated LED lamps, are out of the scope of this
    part of IEC 60747. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- ultraviolet-emitting diodes (UV
    LED) and their related technical contents were added;<br />\r\n- power efficiency
    (ηPE) as part of electrical and optical characteristics were added;<br />\r\n-
    new measuring methods related to thermal resistance were added;<br />\r\n- hydrogen
    sulphide corrosion test was added to quality evaluation;<br />\r\n- some standards
    were added to the bibliography."
