  content: "IEC TS 62600-101:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC TS 62600-101:2024
    establishes a system for estimating, analysing and reporting the wave energy resource
    at sites potentially suitable for the installation of Wave Energy Converters (WECs).
    This document is to be applied at all stages of site assessment, from initial
    investigations to detailed project design. This document is to be applied in conjunction
    with the IEC Technical Specification on WEC performance (IEC TS 62600-100) to
    estimate the mean annual energy production of a WEC or WEC array as described
    in the methodology in Annex A. This document is not intended for estimation of
    extreme wave conditions. The framework and methodologies prescribed in this document
    are intended to ensure that only adequate models are used, and that they are applied
    in an appropriate manner to ensure confidence and consistency in the reported
    results. Moreover, the document prescribes methods for analysing metocean data
    (including the data generated by modelling) in order to properly quantify and
    characterize the temporal and spatial attributes of the wave energy resource,
    and for reporting the results of a resource assessment in a comprehensive and
    consistent manner.</p>"
