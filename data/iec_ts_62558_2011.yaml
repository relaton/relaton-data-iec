abstract:
- content: "IEC/TS 62558:2011(E) specifies essential characteristics of a phantom
    and method for the measurement of void-detectability ratio for medical ultrasound
    systems and related transducers. It is restricted to the aspect of long-term reproducibility
    of testing results. Medical diagnostic ultrasound systems and related transducers
    need periodic testing as the quality of medical decisions based on ultrasonic
    images may decrease over time due to progressive degradation of essential systems
    characteristics. The TMM (Tissue Mimicking Material) phantom is intended to be
    used to measure and to enable documentation of changes in void-detectability ratio
    in periodic tests over years of use. This technical specification establishes:<br
    />\r\n- Important characteristics and requirements for a TMM 3D artificial cyst
    phantom using anechoic voids<br />\r\n- A design example of a 3D artificial cyst
    phantom, the necessary test equipment and use of relevant computer software algorithms.<br
    />\r\nThis technical specification is currently applicable for linear array transducers.
    A uniformity test prior to void-detectability ratio (VDR) measurement is recommended."
