abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-111:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 60335-2-111:2024 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-111:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric ondol-mattresses for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and
    battery-operated appliances. This standard also applies to control units supplied
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use,
    but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used in community spas or by persons in cold ambient temperatures,
    are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to
    be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of
    a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- blankets,
    pads and similar flexible heating appliances (IEC 60335-2-17);<br />\r\n- room
    heaters (IEC 60335-2-30);<br />\r\n- water bed heaters (IEC 60335-2-66);<br />\r\n-
    heating appliances for breeding and rearing animals (IEC 60335-2-71);<br />\r\n-
    foot warmers and heating mats (IEC 60335-2-81);<br />\r\n- flexible sheet heating
    elements for room heating (IEC 60335-2-96);<br />\r\n- heated carpets and heating
    units for room heating installed under removable floor coverings (IEC 60335 2
    106);<br />\r\n- appliances specifically intended for use under medical supervision
    (IEC 80601-2-35).<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) application of test probe
    19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is
    to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1:2020 and its
    amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
