  content: "IEC 62541-4:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62541-4:2020 defines
    the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Services. The Services defined are the collection
    of abstract Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that are implemented by OPC UA Servers
    and called by OPC UA Clients. All interactions between OPC UA Clients and Servers
    occur via these Services. The defined Services are considered abstract because
    no particular RPC mechanism for implementation is defined in this document. IEC
    62541-6 specifies one or more concrete mappings supported for implementation.
    For example, one mapping in IEC 62541-6 is to XML Web Services. In that case the
    Services described in this document appear as the Web service methods in the WSDL
    contract. Not all OPC UA Servers will need to implement all of the defined Services.
    IEC 62541-7 defines the Profiles that dictate which Services need to be implemented
    in order to be compliant with a particular Profile This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Added ability to resend
    all data of monitored items in a Subscription using the ResendData Method.<br
    />\r\nb) Added support for durable Subscriptions (lifetime of hours or days).<br
    />\r\nc) Added Register2 and FindServersOnNetwork Services to support network-wide
    discovery using capability filters.<br />\r\nd) Removed definition of software
    certificates. Will be defined in a future edition.<br />\r\ne) Extended and partially
    revised the redundancy definition. Added sub-range definitions for ServiceLevel
    and added more terms for redundancy.<br />\r\nf) Added a section on how to use
    Authorization Services to request user access tokens.<br />\r\ng) Added JSON Web
    Tokens (JWTs) as a new user token.<br />\r\nh) Added the concept of session-less
    service invocation.<br />\r\ni) Added a generic structure that allows passing
    any number of attributes to the AddNodes Service.<br />\r\nj) Added requirement
    to protect against user identity token attacks.<br />\r\nk) Added new EncryptedSecret
    format for user identity tokens."
