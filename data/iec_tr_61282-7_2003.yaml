abstract:
- content: Provides methods of representing the process statistics of the chromatic
    dispersion of optical fibres and related components that may be combined in a
    link. The presence of chromatic dispersion can induce distortions in signals leading
    to bit errors depending on; source spectral width; source chirp; bit period; distance.
    Has the status of a Technical report.
