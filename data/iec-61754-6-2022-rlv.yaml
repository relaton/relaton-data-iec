    specifies the standard interface dimensions for type MU family of connectors.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2013 and
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the test method
    IEC 61300-3-22 for the compression force of the ferrule was added;<br />\r\n-
    Annex D (informative) with cut out dimension requirements for testing the strength
    of mounted adaptors was added."
