abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 30106-1:2016 specifies an architecture for a set of interfaces
    which define the OO BioAPI. Components defined in this part of ISO/IEC 30106 include
    a framework, Biometric Service Providers (BSPs), Biometric Function Providers
    (BFPs) and a component registry.<p>NOTE Each of these components have an equivalent
    component specified in ISO/IEC 19784‑1 as the OO BioAPI is intended to be an OO
    interpretation of this part of ISO/IEC 30106.</p><p>For this reason, this part
    of ISO/IEC 30106 is conceptually equivalent to ISO/IEC 19784‑1. Concepts present
    in this part of ISO/IEC 30106 (for example, BioAPI_Unit and component registry)
    have the same meaning as in ISO/IEC 19784‑1. While the conceptual equivalence
    of this part of ISO/IEC 30106 will be maintained with ISO/IEC 19784‑1, there are
    differences in the parameters passed between functions and the sequence of function
    calls. These differences exist to take advantage of the features provided by Object
    Oriented Programming Languages.</p>
