abstract:
- content: "IEC 60695-2-12:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60695-2-12:2021
    specifies the details of the glow-wire test to be applied to test specimens of
    solid electrical insulating materials or other solid materials for flammability
    testing to determine the glow-wire flammability index (GWFI). GWFI is the highest
    temperature, determined during this standardized procedure, at which the tested
    material does not ignite or, if it does, extinguishes within 30 s after removal
    of the glow-wire and is not totally consumed; and molten drips, if they occur,
    do not ignite the wrapping tissue. This test method is a materials test carried
    out on a series of standard test specimens. The data obtained, along with data
    from the glow-wire ignition temperature (GWIT) test method for materials, IEC
    60695-2-13, can then be used in a preselection process in accordance with IEC
    60695-1-30 [4] to judge the ability of materials to meet the requirements of IEC
    60695-2-11. This basic safety publication focusing on safety test method(s) is
    primarily intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of safety
    publications in accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and
    ISO/IEC Guide 51. One of the responsibilities of a technical committee is, wherever
    applicable, to make use of basic safety publications in the preparation of its
    publications. This publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60695-2-10.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2010 and
    Amendment 1:2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) New terms and definitions with regards to times and durations
    have been added to Clause 3, with an effect on the application of the test method."
