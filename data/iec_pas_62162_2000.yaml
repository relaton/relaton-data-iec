abstract:
- content: Describes a uniform method for establishing charged-device model (CDM)
    electrostatic discharge (ESD) withstand thresholds. All packages semiconductor
    components, thin film circuits, surface acoustic wave (SAW) components, opto-electronic
    components, hybrid integrated circuits (HICS), and multi-chip modules (MCMs) containing
    any of these components are to be evaluated according to this standard. IEC/PAS
    62162 will be re-issued in the form of IEC international standard under reference
    IEC 60748-20.
