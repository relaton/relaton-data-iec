abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165 defines requirements for Fabrics supporting the
    Fibre Channel Physical and Signaling Interface (FC-PH) that are independent of
    specific Fabric topologies. FC-PH, together with its second generation (FC-PH-2)
    and third generation (FC-PH-3), describes the point-to-point physical interface
    transmission protocol and signaling protocol of a high-performance serial link
    for the support of higher level protocols.
