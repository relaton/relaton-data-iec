abstract:
- content: "This document specifies a method for measuring the digital copying productivity
    of digital copying devices and multifunctional devices with various copying modes.
    It is applicable to digital copying devices and multifunctional devices equipped
    with automatic document feeder (ADF) and collating function. This document is
    intended to be used for black and white (B&W) as well as colour digital copying
    devices and multifunctional devices of any underlying marking technology. It allows
    comparison of the throughput copying rates for a machine operated in various available
    operating modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates, 2-up, etc.) and various
    available digital image processing configurations. This document includes test
    files, test setup procedures, test procedures, and reporting requirements for
    digital copying productivity measurements.<br />\r\nThis document is not intended
    to be used for devices which are not able to copy on a media size of A4/8,5\"
    x 11\"\x80\x9D, devices that do not have an ADF, or devices which are not able
    to collate multiple copies of original prints from a test set.<br />\r\nThis document
    is not intended to replace manufacturer's rated speeds."
