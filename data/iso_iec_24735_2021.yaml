abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a method for measuring the digital copying
    productivity of digital copying devices and multifunctional devices with various
    copying modes. It is applicable to digital copying devices and multifunctional
    devices equipped with automatic document feeder (ADF) and collating function.
    This document is intended to be used for black and white (B&amp;W) as well as
    colour digital copying devices and multifunctional devices of any underlying marking
    technology. It allows comparison of the throughput copying rates for a machine
    operated in various available operating modes (simplex, duplex, size of substrates,
    2-up, etc.) and various available digital image processing configurations. This
    document includes test files, test setup procedures, test procedures, and reporting
    requirements for digital copying productivity measurements.</p><p>This document
    is not intended to be used for devices which are not able to copy on a media size
    of A4/8,5” × 11”, devices that do not have an ADF, or devices which are not able
    to collate multiple copies of original prints from a test set.</p><p>This document
    is not intended to replace manufacturer's rated speeds.</p>"
