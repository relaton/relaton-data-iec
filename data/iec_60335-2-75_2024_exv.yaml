abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-75:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-75:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-75:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric commercial dispensing appliances and vending machines for preparation
    or delivery of food, drinks and consumer products, their rated voltage being not
    more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances including
    direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nExamples
    of appliances that are within the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n– bulk
    tea or coffee brewing machines;<br />\r\n– cigarette vending machines;<br />\r\n–
    coffee grinders for use in areas open to the public;<br />\r\n– commercial liquid
    heaters;<br />\r\n– coffee makers with or without integrated coffee grinder;<br
    />\r\n– coffee makers with cooling systems;<br />\r\n– hot and cold beverage vending
    machines;<br />\r\n– hot water dispensers;<br />\r\n– ice cream and whipped cream
    dispensers;<br />\r\n– ice dispensers;<br />\r\n– newspaper, audio or video tape
    or disc vending machines;<br />\r\n– packaged food and drink vending machines;<br
    />\r\n– refrigerated merchandisers;<br />\r\n– appliances incorporating electrode-type
    liquid heaters.<br />\r\nAppliances can have more than one function.<br />\r\nOther
    standards can be applicable for some functions such as:<br />\r\n– refrigeration
    (IEC 60335-2-89);<br />\r\n– heating by microwaves (IEC 60335-2-90);<br />\r\n–
    professional ice cream makers (IEC 60335-2-118).<br />\r\nThis standard also deals
    with the hygiene aspects of appliances.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by users and maintenance persons. However, in general, it does not take into account
    young children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the
    fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many
    countries, additional requirements for appliances incorporating pressure vessels
    are specified;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used
    exclusively for household purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used
    exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used
    in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– commercial coffee grinders
    for use in areas not open to the public (IEC 60335-2-64);<br />\r\n– commercial
    electric boiling pans (IEC 60335-2-47);<br />\r\n– commercial electric bains-marie
    (IEC 60335-2-50);<br />\r\n– amusement machines and personal service machines
    (IEC 60335-2-82);<br />\r\n– commercial refrigerating appliances (IEC 60335-2-89);<br
    />\r\n– appliances solely used for dispensing money;<br />\r\n– display cabinets;<br
    />\r\n– requirements for dispensed potentially hazardous food (these are covered
    by national health regulations in many countries).<br />\r\nThis fourth edition
    cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2012, Amendment 1:2015 and
    Amendment 2:2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion
    of some notes to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1, 19.2, 19.101);<br />\r\nc) addition
    of requirements for electrode-type liquid heaters (Clause 1, 3.1.9, 3.6.101, 3.7.103,
    13.2, 13.3, 16.2, 16.3, 19.1, 19.103 to 19.106, 22.6, 22.33, 22.115 to 22.118,
    24.1.2, 27.1, Annex BB);<br />\r\nd) addition of test requirements for appliances
    with a recommended ambient temperature above 25 °C (5.7);<br />\r\ne) application
    of test probes 18 and 19 (8.1.1, 20.2, 22.101, B.22.3, B.22.4);<br />\r\nf) addition
    of accessible surface temperature limits including marking of hot surfaces (7.1,
    7.6, 7.12, 7.14, 7.15, 11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ng) addition of requirements to prevent
    simultaneous operation of multiple loads (22.114, Annex R);<br />\r\nh) clarification
    of requirements for thermal cut-outs located in a service area (24.103).<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
