abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62730:2012+AMD1:2024 CSV is applicable to polymeric insulators
    whose insulating body consists of one or various organic materials. Polymeric
    insulators covered by this technical report include both solid core and hollow
    insulators. They are intended for use on overhead lines and in indoor and outdoor
    equipment with a rated voltage greater than 1 000 V. The object of this technical
    report is:<br />\r\n- to define the common terms used;<br />\r\n- to give the
    background behind the development and use of the 5 000 h multiple stress test
    and the tracking wheel test;<br />\r\n- to describe the test methods for the 5
    000 h multiple stress test and the tracking wheel tests on polymeric insulators;<br
    />\r\n- to describe possible acceptance or failure criteria, if applicable. Key
    words: polymeric insulators, multiple stress test, 5000 h"
