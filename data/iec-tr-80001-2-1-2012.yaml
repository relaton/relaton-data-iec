  content: IEC/TR 80001-2-1:2012(E), which is a technical report, is a step-by-step
    guide to help in the application of risk management when creating or changing
    a medical IT-network. It provides easy to apply steps, examples, and information
    helping in the identification and control of risks. All relevant requirements
    in IEC 80001-1:2010 are addressed and links to other clauses and subclauses of
    IEC 80001-1 are addressed where appropriate (e.g. handover to release management
    and monitoring). This technical report focuses on practical risk management. It
    is not intended to provide a full outline or explanation of all requirements that
    are satisfactorily covered by IEC 80001-1. This step-by-step guidance follows
    a 10-step process that follows subclause 4.4 of IEC 80001-1:2010, which specifically
    addresses risk analysis, risk evaluation and risk control. These activities are
    embedded within the full life cycle risk management process. They can never be
    the first step, as risk management follows the general process model which sets
    planning before any action.
