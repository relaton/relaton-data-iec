  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-16-10:2011(E) describes a service definition which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.service. This service-type enables
    modelling of \"Basic Power Management Proxy\" function capabilities. Basic Power
    Management Proxy (BPMPX) is a combination of UPnP service and a control point.
    As Control Point, Proxy discovers and controls Low Power Device services running
    in the network, and as UPnP Proxy service, it advertises itself to the network,
    and responds to actions from low power aware Control Point. [LPARCH] Basic functions
    that BPMPX does are as follows:<br/>                                                     \n-
    Receive multicast discovery messages from power managed UPnP devices in order
    to be. aware of their power states (i.e. the BPMPX will act as Control Point).<br/>
    \                                 \n- Send multicast or unicast discovery messages
    (i.e. M-SEARCH) to query UPnP devices and keep track of their power states (i.e.
    the BPMPX will act as Control Point).<br/>                         \n- Send GetPowerManagementInfo
    action to obtain power management mechanism provided by power-aware devices.<br/>
    \               \n- Should send the appropriate wakeup message to the specified
    sleeping device when it receives WakeupDevice action from power aware Control
    Point. [LPARCH]. Act as UPnP service.<br/>           \n- Sending BPMPX service
    announcements and M-Search replies.<br/>   \n- Respond to SearchSleepingDevices
    action to provide the information of sleeping devices in network.<br/>                               \n-
    Respond to Wakeup action from Control Point. (Wake up action is directed to the
    low power devices and not for waking up the BPMPX)."
