  content: "IEC 60695-11-5:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60695-11-5:2016
    specifies a needle-flame test to simulate the effect of a small flame which may
    result from fault conditions, in order to assess the fire hazard by a simulation
    technique. The results of this test may be used as elements of a fire hazard assessment
    which takes into account all of the factors which are pertinent to an assessment
    of the fire hazard of a particular end use. It is applicable to electrotechnical
    equipment, its sub-assemblies and components and to solid electrical insulating
    materials or other combustible materials. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The scope has been broadened to allow this
    test method to also simulate the effects of small flames from outside the equipment;<br
    />\r\n- Propane and butane gas are the specified fuel source with a minimum purity
    of 95 %;<br />\r\n- A new concept has been added which allows the burner to be
    moved during the test to avoid dripping material from falling onto the tip of
    the burner tube;<br />\r\n- The burner tube material is now a referenced source;<br
    />\r\n- The reference for the copper block material has changed - the ISO publication
    (ISO 1337) has been withdrawn with no replacement. A new callout is now used and
    Informative Annex C and a bibliography have been added. This basic safety publication
    is intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards in
    accordance with the principles laid down in <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/7516\">IEC
    Guide 104</a> and ISO/IEC Guide 51."
