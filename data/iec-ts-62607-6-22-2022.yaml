  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-22:2022 establishes a standardized method to determine
    the key control characteristic\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li style=\"text-align:justify\">ash

    style=\"text-align:justify\">incineration.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nThe ash content is
    derived by residue obtained after incineration under the operating conditions
    specified in this document, being divided by the mass of the dried test portion.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">The method is applicable for graphene, graphene oxide
    and reduced graphene oxide in forms of both dry powder and dispersion. This document
    can be used as reference for graphite oxide and other modified graphene.</li>\r\n\t<li
    style=\"text-align:justify\">Typical application areas of this method are research,
    manufacturer and downstream user to guide material processing and quality control.</li>\r\n</ul>"
