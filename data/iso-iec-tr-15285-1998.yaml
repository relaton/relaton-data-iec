    <p>The purpose of this Technical Report is to provide a general framework for discussing characters and glyphs. The framework is applicable to a variety of coded character sets and glyph-identification schemes. For illustration, this Technical Report uses examples from characters coded in ISO/IEC 10646 and glyphs registered according to ISO/IEC 10036.</p>
    <p>This Technical Report</p>
    <p>-differentiates between coded characters and registered glyphs</p>
    <p>-identifies the domain of use of coded characters and glyph identifiers</p>
    <p>-provides a conceptual framework for the formatting and presentation of coded character data using glyph identifiers and glyph representations</p>
    <p>This Technical Report describes idealized principles that were not completely followed in coding characters for ISO/IEC 10646 and in registering glyphs according to ISO/IEC 10036. The fact that ISO/IEC 10646, ISO/IEC 10036, and other standards do not completely follow the principles in the model does not invalidate the model and does not diminish the utility of having the model.</p>
