abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 18881:2016 is based on the IEEE 1888&#x99;1 protocols,
    this standard describes network gateway central access control and management
    policy through the extension of existing interface protocols, message formats,
    and interactive processing in ubiquitous green community control networks (UGCCNets).
    This standard extends the definition of the original interface protocols and message
    formats and mainly specifies the network gateway signal flow for access control,
    registration management, state querying, event reporting, remote management, etc.</p>"
