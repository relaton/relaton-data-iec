abstract:
- content: "This part of International Standard IEC 60044 applies to new single-phase
    capacitor voltage transformers connected between line and ground for system voltages
    Um Â³ 72,5 kV at power frequencies from 15 Hz to 100 Hz. They are intended to supply
    a low voltage for measurement, control and protective functions. \n\nThis publication
    has the status of a PAS. A PAS is a technical specification not fulfilling the
    requirements for a standard, but made available to the public.\n\nFollowing publication
    of this PAS, the technical committee or subcommittee concerned will investigate
    the possibility of transforming the PAS into an International Standard."
