abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-47:2013+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular copper winding wire of class 240 with a sole coating of aromatic polyimide
    resin. The range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this standard is:<br
    />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm max.
    5,60 mm. Wires of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this specification and apply
    to the complete range of conductors. The specified combinations of width and thickness,
    as well as the specified width/thickness ratio, are given in IEC 60317-0-2. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1997. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    deletion of the \"in some countries\" statement in the scope;<br />\r\n- new subclause
    containing general notes on winding wire, formerly a part of the scope;<br />\r\n-
    new subclause containing requirements for appearance;<br />\r\n- revision to the
    notes in Clause 19, Dielectric dissipation factor;<br />\r\n- new Clause 23, Pin
    hole test.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords: requirements of enamelled rectangular copper
    winding wire, class 240, sole coating of aromatic polyimide resin"
