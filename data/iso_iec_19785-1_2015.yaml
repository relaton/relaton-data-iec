abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines structures and data elements for biometric
    information records (BIRs).</p><p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the concept of
    a domain of use to establish the applicability of a standard or specification
    that complies with CBEFF requirements.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the
    concept of a CBEFF patron format, which is a published BIR format specification
    that complies with CBEFF requirements, specified by a CBEFF patron.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 defines the abstract values (and associated semantics) of a set of
    CBEFF data elements to be used in the definition of CBEFF patron formats.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 specifies the use of CBEFF data elements by a CBEFF patron to define
    the content and encoding of a standard biometric header (SBH) to be included in
    a biometric information record (i.e. the definition of a CBEFF patron format).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 provides the means for identification of the formats of the BDBs
    in a BIR but the standardization and interoperability of BDB formats are not in
    the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785. It also provides a means (the security
    block) for BIRs to carry information about the encryption of a BDB in the BIR
    and about integrity mechanisms applied to the BIR as a whole; the structure and
    content of security blocks are not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.
    Further, the specification of encryption mechanisms for BDBs and of integrity
    mechanisms for BIRs is not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 specifies transformations from one CBEFF patron format to a different
    CBEFF patron format.</p><p>The encoding of the abstract values of CBEFF data elements
    to be used in the specification of CBEFF patron formats is not in the scope of
    this part of ISO/IEC 19785.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19785-3 specifies several patron format
    specifications for which ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37 is the CBEFF patron.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    19785-4 specifies several security block format specifications for which ISO/IEC
    JTC 1 SC 37 is the CBEFF patron.</p><p>Protection of the privacy of individuals
    from inappropriate dissemination and use of biometric data is not in the scope
    of this part of ISO/IEC 19785 but may be subject to national regulation.</p>"
