abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines structures and data elements for biometric
    information records (BIRs).<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the concept
    of a domain of use to establish the applicability of a standard or specification
    that complies with CBEFF requirements.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 defines the
    concept of a CBEFF patron format, which is a published BIR format specification
    that complies with CBEFF requirements, specified by a CBEFF patron.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 defines the abstract values (and associated semantics) of a set of
    CBEFF data elements to be used in the definition of CBEFF patron formats.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 specifies the use of CBEFF data elements by a CBEFF patron to define
    the content and encoding of a standard biometric header (SBH) to be included in
    a biometric information record (i.e. the definition of a CBEFF patron format).<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 19785-1:2015 provides the means for identification of the formats
    of the BDBs in a BIR but the standardization and interoperability of BDB formats
    are not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785. It also provides a means (the
    security block) for BIRs to carry information about the encryption of a BDB in
    the BIR and about integrity mechanisms applied to the BIR as a whole; the structure
    and content of security blocks are not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.
    Further, the specification of encryption mechanisms for BDBs and of integrity
    mechanisms for BIRs is not in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19785-1:2015 specifies transformations from one CBEFF patron format to a different
    CBEFF patron format.<br />\r\nThe encoding of the abstract values of CBEFF data
    elements to be used in the specification of CBEFF patron formats is not in the
    scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19785-3 specifies several
    patron format specifications for which ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37 is the CBEFF patron.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 19785-4 specifies several security block format specifications for
    which ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 37 is the CBEFF patron.<br />\r\nProtection of the privacy
    of individuals from inappropriate dissemination and use of biometric data is not
    in the scope of this part of ISO/IEC 19785 but may be subject to national regulation."
