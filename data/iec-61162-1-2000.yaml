  content: Contains the requirements for data communication between maritime electronic
    instruments, navigation and radiocommunication equipment when interconnected via
    an appropriate system. Is intended to support one-way serial data transmission
    from a single talker to one or more listeners. Is closely aligned with NMEA 0183
    version 2.30. Reference is made to IEC 61162-2 for applications with higher transmission
    rates.
