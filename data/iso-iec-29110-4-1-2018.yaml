    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2018 series is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended to preclude or discourage their use by larger organizations than VSEs.</p>
    <p>The lifecycle processes defined in the ISO/IEC 29110 series can be used by VSEs when using, as well as when creating and supplying, a software system. They can be applied at any level in a software system's structure and at any stage in the lifecycle. The processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended to preclude or discourage the use of additional processes that VSEs find useful. This document is not intended to preclude the use of different life cycles such as: waterfall, iterative, incremental, evolutionary or agile.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2018 provides a profile specification for the Basic profile. The Basic profile applies to VSEs involved in software development. It selects ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207 project management and software implementation process elements from the single project perspective.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29110-4-1:2018 provides the normative and informative links to the subset of ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207.</p>
