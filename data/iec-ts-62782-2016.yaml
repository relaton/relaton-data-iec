  content: IEC TS 62782:2016(E) provides a test method for performing a cyclic (dynamic)
    mechanical load test in which the module is supported at the design support points
    and a uniform load normal to the module surface is cycled in alternating negative
    and positive directions. This test may be utilized to evaluate if components within
    the module including solar cells, interconnect ribbons and/or electrical bonds
    within the module are susceptible to breakage or if edge seals are likely to fail
    due to the mechanical stresses encountered during installation and operation.
    This test can be performed at any module temperature within the normal operating
    temperature range. This test has been written as a standalone technical specification,
    but it is likely to be used in conjunction with other test standards.
