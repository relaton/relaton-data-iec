  content: "IEC 63391:2024 applies to security screening systems that utilize active
    millimetre-wave (MMW) imaging to inspect persons who are not inside vehicles,
    containers, or enclosures. Specifically, this document applies to systems used
    to detect objects carried on the body of the individual being screened at a security
    checkpoint. This document applies to systems that screen people using radiation
    in the range between 3 GHz and 150 GHz (100 mm to 2 mm).<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies the technical requirements, test methods, and signage of the active
    MMW systems for security screening of humans.<br />\r\nThis document does not
    specify minimum or baseline requirements of image quality, automated threat recognition
    (ATR) performance, nor does it specify a minimum detection time"
