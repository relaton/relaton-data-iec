    <p>The ISO/IEC 23091 series defines various systems code points and fields that establish properties of a multimedia stream that are independent of the compression encoding and bit rate. These properties could describe the appropriate interpretation of decoded multimedia data or could, similarly, describe the characteristics of such signals before the signal is compressed by an encoder that is suitable for compressing such an input signal.</p>
    <p>NOTE       ISO/IEC 23091-1:2018 specifies a URN format applicable to code points from any part of the ISO/IEC 23091 series, and could be revised in future to contain code points specific to multimedia systems (in contrast to video and audio).</p>
