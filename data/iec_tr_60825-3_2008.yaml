abstract:
- content: "This part of IEC 60825, which is a technical report, gives guidance on
    the planning and design, set-up and conduct of laser displays and shows that make
    use of high power lasers. The laser power needed to produce effective theatrical
    or artistic displays in large spaces such as theatres, arenas, or architectural
    sites is great enough to pose a severe accidental exposure hazard, even when personal
    exposure is very brief. For this reason, subclause 4.1.5 of IEC/TR 60825-14 specifies
    that only laser products that are Class 1, Class 2 or visible-beam Class 3R should
    be used for demonstration, display or entertainment purposes in unsupervised areas.
    Laser products of other classes should only be permitted under carefully controlled
    conditions and under the control of a trained experienced operator. The guidance
    provided in this technical report is not intended to include the display or demonstration
    of scientific, medical or industrial laser products. However, many of the principles
    in this guidance may be relevant. This guidance provides recommendations for safety
    for those laser displays or demonstrations that are shows, artistic displays,
    advertising or light sculptures, or museum pieces used to demonstrate optical
    principles, etc. Laser products available for use in a domestic environment or
    for use by people who cannot be expected to have received a suitable level of
    training should be Class 1, Class 2 or visible beam Class 3R. Therefore, such
    equipment is outside the scope of this guidance. This guidance is intended to
    be used by those who:<br />\r\n- design, manufacture, assemble, install or operate
    laser products that are Class 4, Class 3B, or non-visible beam Class 3R for display
    and entertainment purposes;<br />\r\n- operate arenas, theatres, planetaria, discotheques
    or other places where such laser products may be installed and operated; or<br
    />\r\n- are responsible for reviewing the safety of such equipment, installations
    or displays.<br />\r\nThis guidance is not normative, but rather a code of practice
    for the design, installation, operation and evaluation of the safety of laser
    light shows and displays, and the equipment employed in their production. This
    guidance is also intended for persons who modify laser display installations or
    equipment. This guidance contains safety criteria for the protection of the public
    or persons in the vicinity of laser displays in the course of their employment.
    In some countries, there may be specific requirements, such as government permissions
    or notifications of shows, or prohibitions, such as against laser scanning of
    spectators without appropriate safeguards. This guidance is not to be understood
    as in conflict with such requirements but merely to be supplementary. This second
    edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1995. It constitutes
    a technical revision. The main changes since the first edition include<br />\r\n-
    clarification of the scope;<br />\r\n- specific guidance on factors to take into
    account regarding scanning safeguards;<br />\r\n- clarification of the records
    to be maintained; and<br />\r\n- modification of the requirements for the zones
    where unattended laser projectors are used."
