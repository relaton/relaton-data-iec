    <p>This specification, EPUB Canonical Fragment Identifier (epubcfi), defines a standardized method for</p>
    <p>referencing arbitrary content within an EPUB® Publication through the use of fragment identifiers.</p>
    <p>The Web has proven that the concept of hyperlinking is tremendously powerful, but EPUB Publications</p>
    <p>have been denied much of the benefit that hyperlinking makes possible because of the lack of a</p>
    <p>standardized scheme to link into them. Although proprietary schemes have been developed and</p>
    <p>implemented for individual Reading Systems, without a commonly-understood syntax there has been no</p>
    <p>way to achieve cross-platform interoperability. The functionality that can see significant benefit from</p>
    <p>breaking down this barrier, however, is varied: from reading location maintenance to annotation</p>
    <p>attachment to navigation, the ability to point into any Publication opens a whole new dimension not</p>
    <p>previously available to developers and Authors.</p>

    <p>This specification attempts to rectify this situation by defining an arbitrary structural reference that can</p>
    <p>uniquely identify any location, or simple range of locations, in a Publication: the EPUB CFI. The following</p>
    <p>considerations have strongly influenced the design and scope of this scheme:</p>

    <p>·         The mechanism used to reference content should be interoperable: references to a reading</p>
    <p>position created by one Reading System should be usable by another.</p>

    <p>·         Document references to EPUB content should be enabled in the same way that existing</p>
    <p>hyperlinks enable references throughout the Web.</p>

    <p>·         Each location in an EPUB file should be able to be identified without the need to modify the</p>
    <p>            document.</p>

    <p>·         All fragment identifiers that reference the same logical location should be equal when compared.</p>

    <p>·         Comparison operations, including tests for sorting and comparison, should be able to be</p>
    <p>performed without accessing the referenced files.</p>

    <p>·         Simple manipulations should be possible without access to the original files (e.g., given a</p>
    <p>reference deep in a file, it should be possible to generate a reference to the start of the file).</p>

    <p>·         Identifier resolution should be reasonably efficient (e.g., processing of the first chapter is not</p>
    <p>required to resolve a fragment identifier that points to the last chapter).</p>

    <p>·         References should be able to recover their target locations through parser variations and document</p>
    <p>revisions.</p>

    <p>·         Expression of simple, contiguous ranges should be supported.</p>

    <p>·         An extensible mechanism to accommodate future reference recovery heuristics should be</p>
    <p>provided.</p>
