    <p>This International Standard defines the basic gesture commands for text editing with pen-based systems and defines the user</p>
    <p>actions required to have the system execute these commands. The feedback to the user when a gesture command has been</p>
    <p>correctly recognized is also defined. This International Standard does not define the user actions necessary for the input of</p>
    <p>characters.</p>
