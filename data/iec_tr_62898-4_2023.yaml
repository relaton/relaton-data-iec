abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62898-4:2023 which is a technical report, provides a set of use
    cases related to microgrids, as a form of "decentralized energy system". Decentralized
    energy systems are small energy systems containing loads and distributed energy
    resources (generation, storage) with decentralized management for energy supply.
    This document completes the SC 8B roadmap for decentralized electrical energy
    systems. The goal is to explain the methodology retained on the microgrid sub-domain,
    which is a kind of decentralized system. This methodology, based on IEC 62913-1,
    describes high-level use cases (business use cases) covering the main typical
    usage of microgrids, and details some of them through system use cases. The proposed
    list of use cases is a first version, proposed for review; the goal is to cover
    all use cases with the same level of depth.
