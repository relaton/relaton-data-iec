abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62865:2014(E) provides a guide to implementing DRPC. Specifically,
    it defines the relationship between the content usage contract, which serves as
    the basis for permission management, and DRPC. The protection of content and the
    application of watermark technology are beyond the scope of this report.
