- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23000-10:2012 specifies a file format designed to store data
    in and exchange data between surveillance systems. The file format provides an
    overall structure for media content and associated metadata. Media data coverage
    includes image, video and audio data. Specific features to support application
    of the format in surveillance systems include dedicated time information in a
    separate track as well as segmentation and segment linking provisions for media
    data.</p>"
