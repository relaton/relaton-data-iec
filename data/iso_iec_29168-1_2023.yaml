abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29168-1:2023 This document specifies the OID resolution system,
    including the overall architecture and a DNS-based resolution mechanism.<br />\r\nIt
    specifies the means for inserting any application-defined information associated
    with an OID node into the DNS (see clause 6) and the means of retrieval of that
    information using the ORS (see clause 7).<br />\r\nIt does not restrict the number
    of applications it can support.<br />\r\nIt specifies the required operation of
    an ORS client (see clause 7), including the mapping of an OID-IRI value by the
    ORS client into a DNS name to produce a DNS query for the specified application
    information and the processing of any returned information. The ORS has no role
    in the allocation or registration of OID nodes.<br />\r\nThe required behaviour
    of an ORS client is specified, but the interfaces to it are specified only in
    terms of the semantics of the interaction. A bit-level application program interface
    is platform and software dependent, and is not in the scope of this document.<br
    />\r\nA special behaviour of an ORS client is specified to cache OID information
    in order to reduce the response time of OID resolution. This document also specifies
    a mechanism to resolve an OID node when one of its superior OID nodes is not ORS-supported.<br
    />\r\nIt does not include a tutorial or complete specification on the management
    of DNS zone files (for that, see IETF RFC 1035 and IETF RFC 3403); it specifies
    (only) the DNS resource records (see 6.3) that need to be inserted in the zone
    files in order to support ORS access to the information associated with an OID
    node.<br />\r\nThis document specifies required DNS zone file resource records,
    and prohibits the use of other resource records of a similar form but with different
    semantics (in DNS zone files in the ORS domain) â€“ see 6.2. It does not otherwise
    restrict the general use of DNS zone files."
