abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics
    of magnetic tape cassettes, using magnetic tape</p><p>12,65 mm wide so as to provide
    physical interchange of such cassettes between drives. It also specifies the quality
    of the</p><p>recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format, called
    Digital Tape Format-2 (DTF-2), thereby allowing data</p><p>interchange between
    drives by means of such cassettes. The format supports variable length Logical
    Records, high-speed</p><p>search, and the use of a registered algorithm for data
    compression.</p><p>This International Standard specifies two sizes of cassette.
    For the purposes of this International Standard the larger cassette is</p><p>referred
    to as Type L, and the smaller as Type S.</p><p>Together with a standard for volume
    and file structure, e.g. International Standard ISO 1001, this International Standard</p><p>provides
    for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
