abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics of
    magnetic tape cassettes, using magnetic tape 12,65 mm wide so as to provide physical
    interchange of such cassettes between drives. It also specifies the quality of
    the recorded signals, the recording method and the recorded format, called Digital
    Tape Format-2 (DTF-2), thereby allowing data interchange between drives by means
    of such cassettes. The format supports variable length Logical Records, high-speed
    search, and the use of a registered algorithm for data compression.<br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies two sizes of cassette. For the purposes of this
    International Standard the larger cassette is<br />\r\nreferred to as Type L,
    and the smaller as Type S.<br />\r\nTogether with a standard for volume and file
    structure, e.g. International Standard ISO 1001, this International Standard provides
    for full data interchange between data processing systems."
