abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19752:2017 is limited to the evaluation of toner cartridge
    page yield for toner containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and
    toner cartridges without a photoconductor) for monochrome electrophotographic
    print systems. This document could also be applied to the printer component of
    any multifunctional device that has a digital input-printing path (i.e. multi-function
    devices that contain printer components).</p><p>ISO/IEC 19752:2017 is only intended
    for the measurement of toner cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from
    this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p><p>NOTE 1 Application of
    this document for yield measurement of toner replenishment systems (i.e. toner
    cartridge- and bottle-type systems where the toner reservoir is internal to the
    printing system and not user-replaceable) requires some procedural modifications
    specifically noted herein. This document is intended for equipment used in the
    office space and does not apply to production volume or large format printing
    machines where the major cost of ownership is not caused by the consumable yield
    measured in this document.</p><p>NOTE 2 An all-in-one cartridge is a cartridge
    that includes at least a toner containment part, a photoreceptor part and a developer
    part (see ISO/IEC 29142-1).</p>"
