abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19752:2017 is limited to the evaluation of toner cartridge page
    yield for toner containing cartridges (i.e. all-in-one toner cartridges and toner
    cartridges without a photoconductor) for monochrome electrophotographic print
    systems. This document could also be applied to the printer component of any multifunctional
    device that has a digital input-printing path (i.e. multi-function devices that
    contain printer components).<p>ISO/IEC 19752:2017 is only intended for the measurement
    of toner cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from this testing regarding
    quality, reliability, etc.</p><p>NOTE 1 Application of this document for yield
    measurement of toner replenishment systems (i.e. toner cartridge- and bottle-type
    systems where the toner reservoir is internal to the printing system and not user-replaceable)
    requires some procedural modifications specifically noted herein. This document
    is intended for equipment used in the office space and does not apply to production
    volume or large format printing machines where the major cost of ownership is
    not caused by the consumable yield measured in this document.</p><p>NOTE 2 An
    all-in-one cartridge is a cartridge that includes at least a toner containment
    part, a photoreceptor part and a developer part (see ISO/IEC 29142-1).</p>
