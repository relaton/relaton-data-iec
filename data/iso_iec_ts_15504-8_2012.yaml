abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 15504-8:2012 provides an example of an IT Service Management
    Process Assessment Model (PAM) for use in performing a conformance assessment
    in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2. It enables implemented
    processes of ISO/IEC 20000-1 to be assessed according to the requirements of ISO/IEC
    15504-2.<br /><br />\r\nAn integral part of conducting an assessment is to use
    a PAM that is constructed for that purpose. A PAM is related to a Process Reference
    Model (PRM) and is conformant with ISO/IEC 15504-2."
