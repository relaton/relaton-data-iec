  content: Provides guidance related to the testing of microelectronic devices for
    purposes of measuring their susceptibility to single event effects (SEE) induced
    by the atmospheric neutrons. Also shows how the test data can be used to estimate
    the SEE rate of devices and boards due to the atmospheric neutrons in the atmosphere
    at aircraft altitudes.
