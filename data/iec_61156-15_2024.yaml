abstract:
- content: "IEC 61156-15:2024 refers to cables as described in IEC 61156-5:2020 or
    cables containing element(s) from cables as described in IEC 61156-5 which are
    required to maintain both circuit integrity and data transmission capability before,
    during and after flame application under specified conditions.<br />\r\nIn addition
    to the basic cable construction, it describes the means of sample preparation,
    checking arrangements and gives the performance requirements, means to evaluate
    the data transmission capability during and after subjecting to fire, and gives
    means for evaluating test results and the parameters that are specified in the
    detail specification.<br />\r\nThe cables covered by this document are intended
    to operate with voltages and currents normally encountered in communication systems.
    While these cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low impedance
    sources, for example the electric power supplies of public utility mains, they
    are intended to be used to support the delivery of low voltage remote powering
    applications and have no rated voltage and are used for extra low voltage circuits.<br
    />\r\nFor the purpose of this document, fire conditions as currently listed in
    IEC 60331-23:1999 and basic test apparatus as per IEC 60331-11:1999 apply.<br
    />\r\nAs the test method according to IEC 60331-23:1999 will not be developed
    further, other test methods could be used or added in future editions of this
    document.<br />\r\nIEC 60331-1 and IEC 60331-2 will be added in a future revision
    as the standard tests for circuit integrity and the test rig to be used for all
    testing."
