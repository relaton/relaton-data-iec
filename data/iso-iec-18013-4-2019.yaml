    <p>This document describes the test methods used for conformity testing, that is methods for determining whether a driving licence can be considered to comply with the requirements of the ISO/IEC 18013 series for:</p>
    <p>—     machine readable technologies (ISO/IEC 18013-2), and</p>
    <p>—     access control, authentication and integrity validation (ISO/IEC 18013-3).</p>
    <p>The test methods described in this document are based on specifications defined in ISO/IEC 18013-2 and ISO/IEC 18013-3 and underlying normative specifications.</p>
    <p>This document deals with test methods specific to IDL requirements. Test methods applicable to (smart) cards in general (e.g. those specified in the ISO/IEC 10373 series) are outside the scope of this document.</p>
    <p>Hence the purpose of this document is to:</p>
    <p>—     provide IDL implementers with requirements for conformity evaluation,</p>
    <p>—     provide IDL issuing authorities with requirements for quality assurance, and</p>
    <p>—     provide test laboratories and test tool providers with test suite requirements.</p>
