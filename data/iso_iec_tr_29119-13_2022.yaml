abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 29119-13:2022 This document:<br />\r\n- gives information for
    software testers for the systematic, risk-based testing of biometric systems and
    larger systems which include biometric subsystems;<br />\r\n- establishes the
    importance of both biometric standards and software testing standards and provides
    overviews of both areas and their standardization;<br />\r\n- specifies the most
    important biometric standards for software testers of biometric systems;<br />\r\n-
    provides information for software testers who wish to conform to both the relevant
    biometrics standards and the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards
    by providing mappings between the two sets of standards;<br />\r\n- is not limited
    to the testing of the technical performance of biometric systems in terms of error
    rates and throughput rates, but instead covers the testing of the full range of
    relevant quality characteristics, such as reliability, availability, maintainability,
    security, conformance, usability, human factors, and privacy regulation compliance;<br
    />\r\n- gives information on applying a risk-based testing approach to the testing
    of biometric systems that covers the full range of product and project risks;<br
    />\r\n- provides testers with an example set of product and project risks associated
    with biometric systems along with suggestions on how these risks can be treated
    as part of a risk-based approach to the testing;<br />\r\n- includes mappings
    between the documentation requirements of ISO/IEC 19795-1, ISO/IEC 19795-2 and
    ISO/IEC 19795-6 and the software test documentation defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3."
