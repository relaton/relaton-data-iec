abstract:
- content: "<p>This document:</p><p>— gives information for software testers for the
    systematic, risk-based testing of biometric systems and larger systems which include
    biometric subsystems;</p><p>— establishes the importance of both biometric standards
    and software testing standards and provides overviews of both areas and their
    standardization;</p><p>— specifies the most important biometric standards for
    software testers of biometric systems;</p><p>— provides information for software
    testers who wish to conform to both the relevant biometrics standards and the
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119 series of software testing standards by providing mappings
    between the two sets of standards;</p><p>— is not limited to the testing of the
    technical performance of biometric systems in terms of error rates and throughput
    rates, but instead covers the testing of the full range of relevant quality characteristics,
    such as reliability, availability, maintainability, security, conformance, usability,
    human factors, and privacy regulation compliance;</p><p>— gives information on
    applying a risk-based testing approach to the testing of biometric systems that
    covers the full range of product and project risks;</p><p>— provides testers with
    an example set of product and project risks associated with biometric systems
    along with suggestions on how these risks can be treated as part of a risk-based
    approach to the testing;</p><p>— includes mappings between the documentation requirements
    of ISO/IEC 19795-1, ISO/IEC 19795-2 and ISO/IEC 19795-6 and the software test
    documentation defined by ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3.</p>"
