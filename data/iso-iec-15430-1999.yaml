    <p>This International Standard specifies the Wireless terminal call handling additional network features (ANF-WTMI,</p>
    <p>ANF-WTMO), which are applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks</p>
    <p>(PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>Additional network feature Wireless terminal incoming call (ANF-WTMI) directs incoming calls to a WTMI user</p>
    <p>within a PISN regardless of the WTMI user's geographical location within the PISN, provided the WTMI user's</p>
    <p>location is known.</p>
    <p>Additional network feature Wireless terminal outgoing call (ANF-WTMO) detects an outgoing call from a WTMO</p>
    <p>user and establishes it as a basic call, regardless of the user's geographical location within the PISN. It also</p>
    <p>provides the WTMO user's service profile for use by outgoing call control, or alternatively passes the call to the</p>
    <p>WTMO user's home location for processing.</p>
    <p>Service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT Recommendation</p>
    <p>I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of ANF-WTMI and ANF-WTMO.</p>
    <p>The stage 1 specification (clauses 6 and 7) specifies the service as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2</p>
    <p>specification (clauses 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the service and the information flows</p>
    <p>between them.</p>
