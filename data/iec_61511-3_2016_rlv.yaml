abstract:
- content: "IEC 61511-3:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61511-3:2016 applies
    when functional safety is achieved using one or more SIF for the protection of
    either personnel, the general public, or the environment; may be applied in non-safety
    applications such as asset protection; illustrates typical hazard and risk assessment
    methods that may be carried out to define the safety functional requirements and
    SIL of each SIF; illustrates techniques/measures available for determining the
    required SIL; provides a framework for establishing SIL but does not specify the
    SIL required for specific applications; does not give examples of determining
    the requirements for other methods of risk reduction. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition: Additional H&RA example(s) and quantitative analysis
    consideration annexes are provided."
