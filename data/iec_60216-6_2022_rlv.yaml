abstract:
- content: "IEC 60216-6:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60216-6:2022
    specifies the experimental and calculation procedures for deriving the thermal
    endurance characteristics, temperature index (TI) and relative temperature index
    (RTI) of an electrical insulating material (EIM) using the “fixed time frame method
    (FTFM)”. In this protocol, the ageing takes place for a small number of fixed
    times, using the appro­priate number of ageing temperatures throughout each time,
    the properties of the specimens being measured at the end of the relevant time
    interval. This differs from the procedure of IEC 60216-1, where ageing is conducted
    at a small number of fixed temperatures, property measurement taking place after
    ageing times dependent on the progress of ageing. The diagnostic tests employed
    in the fixed time frame method are restricted to destructive tests. The method
    has not yet been applied to non-destructive or proof test procedures. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- clarification of definition of index properties vs. endurance
    properties;<br />\r\n- complete rework of Annex G and the corresponding program."
