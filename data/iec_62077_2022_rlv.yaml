abstract:
- content: "IEC 62077:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62077: 2022
    applies to circulators used in the field of fibre optics bearing all of the following
    features:<br />\r\n- they are non-reciprocal optical devices, in which each port
    is either an optical fibre or fibre optic connector;<br />\r\n- they are passive
    devices in accordance with the categorization and definition provided in IEC TS
    62538;<br />\r\n- they have three or more ports for directionally transmitting
    optical power.<br />\r\nAn example of optical circulator technology and application
    is described in Annex A and Annex B, respectively. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- harmonization of terms and definitions
