abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-28:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-28:2015 specifies
    the requirements, testing and marking of equipment emitting optical radiation
    intended for use in explosive atmospheres. It also covers equipment located outside
    the explosive atmosphere or protected by a Type of Protection listed in IEC 60079-0,
    but which generates optical radiation that is intended to enter an explosive atmosphere.
    It covers Groups I, II and III, and EPLs Ga, Gb, Gc, Da, Db, Dc, Ma and Mb. This
    standard does not cover ignition by ultraviolet radiation and by absorption of
    the radiation in the explosive mixture itself. Explosive absorbers or absorbers
    that contain their own oxidizer as well as catalytic absorbers are also outside
    the scope of this standard. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition, published in 2006, and constitutes a technical revision. Refer to the
    Foreword of the document for a complete listing of the technical changes between
    edition 2.0 and previous edition of the document.<br />\r\nKeywords: equipment
    emitting optical radiation intended for use in explosive atmospheres<br />\r\nThe
    interpretation sheet 1 of November 2019 have been included in this copy."
