abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 26557:2016, within the context of tools and methods of variability
    mechanisms for software and system product lines<strong>:</strong></p><p>- provides
    the terms and definitions related to variability mechanisms for software and systems
    product lines;</p><p>- defines processes and their subprocesses for operating
    variability mechanisms at each product line life cycle stages and those for providing
    managerial supports. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs,
    tasks and outcomes;</p><p>- defines method capabilities to support the defined
    tasks of each process;</p><p>- defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate
    tasks or defined method capabilities.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26557:2016 does not concern
    processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system, but rather
    deals with those for a family of products.</p>"
