  content: "IEC 62893-3:2017(E) applies to cables for AC charging according to modes
    1, 2 and 3 of IEC 61851-1. The cables are of rated voltages <em>U<sub>0</sub>/U</em>
    up to and including 450/750 V. Ordinary duty cables with rated voltage 300/500
    V are only permitted for charging mode 1 of IEC 61851-1.<br />\r\nMaximum conductor
    operating temperature for the cables in this document is 90 ºC."
