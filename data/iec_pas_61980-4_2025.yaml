abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 61980-4:2025 applies to the off-board supply equipment for high-power
    wireless power transfer (H-WPT) via magnetic field (MF-WPT) to electric road vehicles
    for purposes of supplying electric energy to the RESS (rechargeable energy storage
    system) or other on-board electrical systems, or both.<br />\r\nThe MF-WPT system
    operates at standard supply voltage ratings per IEC 60038 up to 1 000 V AC and
    up to 1 500 V DC from the supply network. The power transfer takes place while
    the electric vehicle (EV) is stationary.<br />\r\nThe aspects covered in this
    document include<br />\r\n– the characteristics and operating conditions,<br />\r\n–
    specific power transfer requirements for the off-board side of magnetic field
    high-power wireless power transfer systems for electric road vehicles,<br />\r\n–
    the required level of electrical safety,<br />\r\n– requirements for basic communication
    for safety and process matters if required by a MF WPT system,<br />\r\n– requirements
    for positioning to assure efficient and safe MF-WPT power transfer, and<br />\r\n–
    specific EMC requirements for MF-WPT systems<br />\r\nThis document does not apply
    to<br />\r\n– safety aspects related to maintenance, and<br />\r\n– trolley buses,
    rail vehicles and vehicles designed primarily for use off-road"
