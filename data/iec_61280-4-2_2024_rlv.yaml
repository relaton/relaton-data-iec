abstract:
- content: "IEC 61280-4-2:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62180-4-2:2024
    is applicable to the measurements of attenuation and optical return loss of an
    installed optical fibre cabling plant using single-mode fibre. This cabling plant
    can include single-mode optical fibres, connectors, adapters, splices, and other
    passive devices. The cabling can be installed in a variety of environments including
    residential, commercial, industrial and data centre premises, as well as outside
    plant environments. This document is applicable to all single-mode fibre types
    including those designated by IEC 60793-2-50 as Class B fibres. The principles
    of this document can be applied to cabling plants containing branching devices
    (splitters) and at specific wavelength ranges in situations where passive wavelength
    selective components are deployed, such as WDM, CWDM and DWDM devices. This document
    is not intended to apply to cabling plants that include active devices such as
    fibre amplifiers or dynamic channel equalizers. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of the equipment cord method;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of test limit adjustment related to test cord grades;<br />\r\nc)
    refinements on measurement uncertainties."
