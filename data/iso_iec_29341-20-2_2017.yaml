abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-20-2:2017 is compliant with the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture
    version 1.0 [14]. It defines a device type referred to herein as MediaRenderer.<br
    />\r\nThe MediaRenderer specification defines a general-purpose device template
    that can be used to instantiate any Consumer Electronics (CE) device that is capable
    of rendering AV content from the home network. It exposes a set of rendering controls
    in which a control point can control how the specified AV content is rendered.
    This includes controlling various rendering features such as brightness, contrast,
    volume, etc.<br />\r\nExample instances of a MediaRenderer include traditional
    devices such as TVs and stereo systems. Some more contemporary examples include
    digital devices such as MP3 players and Electronic Picture Frames (EPFs). Although
    most of these examples typically render one specific type of content (for example,
    a TV typically renders video content), a MediaRenderer is able to support a number
    of different data formats and transfer protocols. For example, a sophisticated
    implementation of a TV MediaRenderer could also support MP3 data so that its speakers
    could be used to play MP3 audio content.<br />\r\nThe MediaRenderer device specification
    is very lightweight and is easy to implement on low-resource devices such as an
    MP3 player. However, it can also be used to expose the high-end capabilities of
    devices such as a PC."
