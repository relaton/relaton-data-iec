    <p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Message Waiting Indication supplementary service (SS-MWI) at the Q reference point between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINXs) connected together within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p>
    <p>The supplementary service MWI enables a Served User to be sent a Message Waiting Indication and also enables this Message Waiting Indication to be cancelled. The Served User may also be permitted to interrogate the Message Centre for any Message Waiting Indication.</p>
    <p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p>
    <p>Service specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in ETS 300 387. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15505.</p>
    <p>The signalling protocol for SS-MWI uses certain aspects of the generic procedures for the control of supplementary services specified in ISO/IEC 11582.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 also specifies additional signalling protocol requirements for the support of interactions at the Q reference point between SS-MWI and other supplementary services and ANFs.</p>
    <p>NOTE Additional interactions that have no impact on the signalling protocol at the Q reference point can be found in the relevant stage 1 specifications.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15506:2003 is applicable to PINXs which can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>
