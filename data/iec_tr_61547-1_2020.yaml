abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TR 61547-1:2020 is available as IEC TR 61547-1:2020 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<p>IEC TR 61547-1:2020
    describes an objective light flickermeter, which can be applied for the following
    purposes:<br />\r\n- measuring the intrinsic performance of all lighting equipment
    without the application of voltage fluctuations in terms of illuminance flicker;
    during this measurement, the lighting equipment is supplied with a stable mains;<br
    />\r\n- testing the immunity performance of lighting equipment against (unintentional)
    voltage fluctuation disturbance on the AC mains in terms of illuminance flicker;
    during this test a set of defined voltage fluctuations are applied to the AC mains
    and the immunity of the lighting equipment to the disturbance is determined.<br
    />\r\nApart from the above two purposes, the immunity performance of lighting
    equipment can also be tested against intentional voltage fluctuation on the AC
    mains arising for example from mains signalling. This is however not described
    in further detail in this document. This third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the scope of this document has been clarified
    to make a distinction between flicker testing without voltage fluctuations to
    measure the intrinsic performance of lighting equipment and flicker testing in
    which a specific set of voltage fluctuations are applied in order to measure the
    immunity of the lighting equipment to voltage fluctuations present on the mains;<br
    />\r\n- the test procedure for flicker testing has been clarified.</p>"
