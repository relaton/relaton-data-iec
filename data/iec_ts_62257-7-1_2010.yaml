abstract:
- content: "IEC/TS 62257-7-1:2010(E) specifies the general requirements for the design
    and the safety of generators used in decentralized rural electrification systems.
    Provides requirements for ELV and LV PV arrays. Particular attention must be paid
    to voltage level, as this is important for safety reasons and has an influence
    on protective measures and on the skill and ability level of operators. The main
    technical changes with regard to the previous edition are the following:<br />\r\n-
    this new version is focused on small PV generators up to 100 kWp;<br />\r\n- it
    provides case studies."
