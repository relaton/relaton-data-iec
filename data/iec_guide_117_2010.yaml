abstract:
- content: IEC Guide 117:2010(E) provides guidance for assessing the risk, to any
    person, of a burn from contact with hot touchable surfaces of electrotechnical
    equipment. Establishes surface temperature limits, where such limits are required,
    and describes the maximum contact periods with a hot surface that any person may
    be subjected to without being exposed to a risk of burn. Curves of maximum temperatures
    versus contact times are described for different types of material with different
    types of surfaces. These temperature limit values shall be taken into consideration
    by technical committees in determining surface temperature limits in product standards.
