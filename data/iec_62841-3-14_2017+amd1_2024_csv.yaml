abstract:
- content: "IEC 62841-3-14:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV applies to transportable drain cleaners.
    The rated voltage is not more than 250 V for single-phase a.c. or d.c. tools,
    and 480 V for three-phase a.c. tools. The rated input is not more than 3 700 W.
    The limits for the applicability of this standard for battery tools are given
    in Annex K. This standard deals with the hazards presented by tools which are
    encountered by all persons in the normal use and reasonably foreseeable misuse
    of the tools. Hand-held electric tools, which can be mounted on a support or working
    stand for use as fixed tools without any alteration of the tool itself, are within
    the scope of this standard and such combination of a hand-held tool and a support
    is considered to be a transportable tool and thus covered by the relevant Part
    3.<br />\r\nDrain cleaners are also known as pipe cleaners.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to hand-held drain cleaners. Hand-held drain cleaners are covered
    by IEC 62841-2-21.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to high pressure cleaners
    to clean drains. High pressure cleaners are covered by IEC 60335-2-79.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to machines that use a solid rod to clean drains<br />\r\nThis
    Part 3-14 is to be used in conjunction with the first edition of IEC 62841-1:2014.<br
    />\r\nThe attention of National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment
    manufacturers and testing organizations may need a transitional period following
    publication of a new, amended or revised IEC publication in which to make products
    in accordance with the new requirements and to equip themselves for conducting
    new or revised tests.<br />\r\nIt is the recommendation of the committee that
    the content of this publication be adopted for implementation nationally not earlier
    than 36 months from the date of publication."
