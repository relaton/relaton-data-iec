abstract:
- content: <p>This International Standard specifies the 8-contact connector (plug
    and jack) and the assignments of its contact</p><p>numbers for use in the physical
    interfaces of Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) primary rate access</p><p>services
    conforming to ITU-T Recommendation I.431.</p><p>In this International Standard,
    as in ITU-T Recommendation I.431, the term "NT" is used to indicate the network</p><p>terminating
    layer 1 aspects of NT1s and NT2s, and the term "TE" is used to indicate terminal
    layer 1 aspects of</p><p>TE1s, TAs and NT2s.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>1 This International
    Standard specifies only those connector dimensions required to ensure intermatability
    of plug and</p><p>jack. Complete detailed specifications of the connector are
    the subject of IEC 603-7, see annex C.</p><p>2 ITU-T recognizes an alternative
    connection system which is not covered by this International Standard. It uses</p><p>coaxial
    connectors as specified in IEC 169-8 (see annex C), and is illustrated in annex
    B.</p>
