abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the 8-contact connector (plug and jack) and the assignments of its contact</p><p>numbers
    for use in the physical interfaces of Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
    primary rate access</p><p>services conforming to ITU-T Recommendation I.431.</p><p>In
    this International Standard, as in ITU-T Recommendation I.431, the term "NT" is
    used to indicate the network</p><p>terminating layer 1 aspects of NT1s and NT2s,
    and the term "TE" is used to indicate terminal layer 1 aspects of</p><p>TE1s,
    TAs and NT2s.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>1 This International Standard specifies only those
    connector dimensions required to ensure intermatability of plug and</p><p>jack.
    Complete detailed specifications of the connector are the subject of IEC 603-7,
    see annex C.</p><p>2 ITU-T recognizes an alternative connection system which is
    not covered by this International Standard. It uses</p><p>coaxial connectors as
    specified in IEC 169-8 (see annex C), and is illustrated in annex B.</p>
