abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63282:2020(E) collects information and reports experience in order
    to make recommendations for the standardization of voltage levels and related
    aspects (power quality, EMC, measurement â€¦) for LVDC systems (systems with voltage
    level lower than 1 500 V d.c.).<br />\r\nRationale for the proposed voltage values
    are given. Variation of parameters for the voltage (power quality) and recommendation
    for their boundaries are defined. Nevertheless, some of the technical items are
    not exhaustively explained in this document and some gaps are identified for future
    work.<br />\r\nAttention is paid to the definition of DC voltage.<br />\r\nSystems
    in which a unipolar voltage is interrupted periodically for certain purposes,
    e.g. pulse voltage, are not considered.<br />\r\nTraction systems are excluded
    from this document"
