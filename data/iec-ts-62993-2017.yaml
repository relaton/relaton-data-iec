  content: "IEC TS 62993:2017 gives guidance to technical committees which deal with
    equipment having a rated voltage of more than 1 000 V AC and up to 2 000 V AC,
    or a rated voltage of more than 1 500 V DC and up to 3 000 V DC. Rated voltages
    up to 1 000 V AC and 1 500 V DC, as well as higher or lower internal voltages,
    are covered by IEC 60664-1.<br />\r\nThis document applies to equipment for use
    up to 2 000 m above sea level, and provides guidance for use at higher altitudes.<br
    />\r\nThis document gives guidance for clearances, creepage distances and solid
    insulation for equipment to achieve safety. It includes methods of electric testing.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of June 2018 have been included in this
    copy."
