    The object of this technical specification is as follows:

    - to protect persons from exposure to hazardous infrared optical radiation, resulting from products used for free air infrared data transmission, remote control, surveillance;

    - to lay down requirements, for both user and manufacturer, to establish procedures and supply information so that proper precautions can be adopted;

    - to ensure adequate warning to individuals of hazards associated with accessible optical radiation from products with infrared optical sources, through signs, labels and instructions;

    - to reduce the possibility of injury by minimizing unnecessary accessible radiation, and to give improved control of the optical radiation emitted by products with infrared optical sources, through protective features and also to provide safe usage of products.
