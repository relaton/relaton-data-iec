abstract:
- content: "IEC 60730-2-8:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60730-2-8:2018 applies to
    electrically operated water valves for use in, on or in association with equipment
    for household and similar use, including heating, air-conditioning and similar
    applications. The equipment can use electricity, gas, oil, solid fuel, solar thermal
    energy, etc., or a combination thereof. This document is applicable to electrically
    operated water valves for building automation within the scope of ISO 16484. This
    document also applies to automatic electrically operated water valves for equipment
    that can be used by the public, such as equipment intended to be used in shops,
    offices, hospitals, farms and commercial and industrial applications. This document
    does not apply to electrically operated water valves intended exclusively for
    industrial process applications unless explicitly mentioned in the relevant equipment
    standard. This document applies to electrically operated water valves powered
    by primary or secondary batteries, requirements for which are contained within
    the standard, including Annex V. This document does not cover the prevention of
    contamination of drinking water as a result of contact with materials. This document
    applies to the inherent safety, to the operating values, operating times and operating
    sequences where such are associated with equipment safety, and to the testing
    of automatic electrical control devices used in, on or in association with, household
    and similar equipment. This document contains requirements for electrical features
    of water valves and requirements for mechanical features of valves that affect
    their intended operation. This document is also applicable to electrically operated
    water valves for appliances within the scope of the IEC 60335 series of standards.
    This document does not apply to:<br />\r\n- electrically operated water valves
    of nominal connection size above DN 50;<br />\r\n- electrically operated water
    valves for admissible nominal pressure rating above 1,6 MPa;<br />\r\n- food dispensers;<br
    />\r\n- detergent dispensers;<br />\r\n- steam valves;<br />\r\n- electrically
    operated water valves designed exclusively for industrial applications. This document
    applies to electrically operated water valves, responsive to or controlling such
    characteristics as temperature, pressure, passage of time, humidity, light, electrostatic
    effects, flow, or liquid level, current, voltage, acceleration, or combinations
    thereof. This document also applies to actuators and to valve bodies which are
    designed to be fitted to each other. This document applies to individual valves,
    valves utilized as part of a system and valves mechanically integral with multi-functional
    controls having non-electrical outputs. This document applies to AC or DC powered
    electrically operated water valves with a rated voltage not exceeding 690 V AC
    or 600 V DC. This document does not take into account the response value of an
    automatic action of a valve, if such a response value is dependent upon the method
    of mounting the valve in the equipment. Where a response value is of significant
    purpose for the protection of the user, or surroundings, the value defined in
    the appropriate equipment standard or as determined by the manufacturer shall
    apply. This document applies also to electrically operated water valves incorporating
    electronic devices, requirements for which are contained in Annex H. This document
    applies also to electrically operated water valves using NTC or PTC thermistors,
    requirements for which are contained in Annex J. This document applies to the
    electrical and functional safety of electrically operated water valves capable
    of receiving and responding to communications signals, including signals for power
    billing rate and demand response. The signals can be transmitted to or received
    from external units being part of the valve (wired), or to and from external units
    which are not part of the valve (wireless) under test. This document does not
    address the integrity of the output signal to the network devices, such as interoperability
    with other devices unless it has been evaluated as part of the control system.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2000,
    Amendment 1:2002 and its Amendment 2:2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- alignment of the text with IEC 60730-1
    fifth edition (2013) including Amendment 1:2015;<br />\r\n- introduction of specific
    requirements for thermoplastic bodied valves for the control of water for tap
    and shower outlets (18.101.4.3 and Annex CC);<br />\r\n- removal of Subclause
    18.102 Wetted material specifications. This part 2-8 is intended to be used in
    conjunction with IEC 60730-1. It was established on the basis of the fifth edition
    (2013) including Amendment 1 (2015) of that publication.<br /><br />\r\nKey words:
