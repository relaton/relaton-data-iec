  content: IEC TR 61577-5:2019 provides basic data and technical information in order
    to support the design of instruments and their practical application for the measurement.
    The document covers 222Rn as well as 220Rn and the short-lived decay products
    of both. It is an accompanying document for the application of the technical standards
    series IEC 61577, and provides physical and technical fundamentals of the measurements
    methods.
