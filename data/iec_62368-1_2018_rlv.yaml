abstract:
- content: "IEC 62368-1:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62368-1:2018 is applicable
    to the safety of electrical and electronic equipment within the field of audio,
    video, information and communication technology, and business and office machines
    with a rated voltage not exceeding 600 V. This document does not include requirements
    for performance or functional characteristics of equipment. This is a product
    safety standard that classifies energy sources, prescribes safeguards against
    those energy sources, and provides guidance on the application of, and requirements
    for, those safeguards. The prescribed safeguards are intended to reduce the likelihood
    of pain, injury and, in the case of fire, property damage. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n– addition of requirements
    for outdoor equipment;<br />\r\n– new requirements for optical radiation;<br />\r\n–
    addition of requirements for insulating liquids;<br />\r\n– addition of requirements
    for work cells;<br />\r\n– addition of requirements for wireless power transmitters;<br
    />\r\n– addition of requirements for fully insulated winding wire (FIW);<br />\r\n–
    alternative method for determination of top, bottom and side openings for fire
    enclosures;<br />\r\n– alternative requirements for sound pressure.<br />\r\nThis
    group safety publication is primarily intended to be used as a product safety
    standard for the products mentioned in the scope, but shall also be used by technical
    committees in the preparation of standards for products similar to those mentioned
    in the scope of this standard, in accordance with the principles laid down in
    IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of
    April 2020 have been included in this copy.<br />\r\nKey words: Audio, Video,
    Communication, Safety</p>"
