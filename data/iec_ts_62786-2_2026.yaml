abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62786-2:2026 supplements IEC TS 62786-1, and specifies requirements
    for the connection of the solar photovoltaic energy system or photovoltaic generating
    system (PV system) with an electric power network, or the network. This document
    covers all sizes of PV systems connected to low voltage or medium voltage power
    networks and gives typical requirements for various sizes of PV systems.<br />\r\nIn
    this document, requirements for grid-connected PV systems are applied to those
    categorized as grid tied, grid tied with storage and grid tied with storage and
    back up. Mini-grid and Micro-grid are out of scope. Those types of PV systems
    with possible elements are described in 4.3.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    the following technical requirements for the PV system:<br />\r\n- reference points
    of requirements,<br />\r\n- elements and configuration,<br />\r\n- basic operation,<br
    />\r\n- protection and fault ride through function,<br />\r\n- power control and
    grid support function,<br />\r\n- electromagnetic compatibility for low frequency
    conducted disturbances,<br />\r\n- information exchange for remote monitoring,
    control, and configuration."
