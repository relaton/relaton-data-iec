  content: "IEC TR 80002-3:2014 which is a technical report (TR), provides the description
    of software life cycle processes for medical devices. The medical device software
    life cycle processes are derived from IEC 62304:2006, with corresponding safety
    classes. They have been aligned with the software development life cycle processes
    of ISO/IEC 12207:2008 and are presented herein in full compliance with ISO/IEC
    24774:2010. The content of these three standards provides the foundation of this
    TR. This TR does not:<br />\r\n- address areas already covered by existing related
    standards, e.g. the international standards that relate to the four standards
    used to build this TR (see Bibliography);<br />\r\n- FDA guidance documents; or<br
    />\r\n- software development tools. This TR describes the process reference model
    for medical device software development and is limited in scope to the life cycle
    processes described in IEC 62304:2006. The process names correspond to those of
    IEC 62304:2006. The mappings provided in Annex B are essential for the alignment
    between IEC 62304:2006 (which is based on ISO/IEC 12207:1995) and ISO/IEC 12207:2008,
    developed to address the detailed normative relationship between the two standards.
    This technical report is not intended to be used as the basis of regulatory inspection
    or certification assessment activities."
