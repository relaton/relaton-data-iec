  content: "IEC TS 62876-3-4:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a standardized guideline to assess<br />\r\n• reliability of metallic interfaces<br
    />\r\nof Ohmic-contacted field-effect transistors (FETs) using 2D nano-materials
    by quantifying<br />\r\n• linearity of current-voltage (I-V) output curves<br
    />\r\nfor devices with various materials combinations of van der Waals (vdW) interfaces.<br
    />\r\nFor metallic interfaces with 2D materials (eg. graphene, MoS2, MoTe2, WS2,
    WSe2, etc) and metals (eg. Ti, Cr, Au, Pd, In, Sb, etc), the reliability of Ohmic
    contact is quantified.<br />\r\nFor FETs consisting of 2D materials-based channels
    (eg. MoS2, MoTe2, WS2, WSe2, etc), the reliability of Ohmic contact when varying
    contacting metal, channel length, channel thickness, applied voltage, and surface
    treatment condition is quantified.<br />\r\nThe reliability of the metallic contacts
    is quantified from the linearity of I-V characteristics measured over extended
    time periods."
