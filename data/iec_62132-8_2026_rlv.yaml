abstract:
- content: "IEC 62132-8:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62132-8:2026
    specifies a method for measuring the immunity of an integrated circuit (IC) to
    radio frequency (RF) radiated electromagnetic disturbances using an IC stripline.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) frequency range of 150 kHz to 3 GHz was deleted
    from the scope;<br />\r\nb) extension of upper usable frequency to 6 GHz or higher
    as long as the defined requirements are fulfilled.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 62132
    is to be read in conjunction with IEC 62132-1."
