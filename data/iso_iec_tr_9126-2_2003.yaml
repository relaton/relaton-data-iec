abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>provides external metrics for measuring
    attributes of six external quality characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 9126-1.
    ISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>defines external metrics, ISO/IEC TR 9126-3 defines
    internal metrics and ISO/IEC 9126-4 defines quality in use metrics, for measurement
    of the characteristics or the subcharacteristics. Internal metrics measure the
    software itself, external metrics measure the behaviour of the computer-based
    system that includes the software, and quality in use metrics measure the effects
    of using the software in a specific context of use.<br /><br />\r\nThe metrics
    listed in ISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>are not intended to be an exhaustive
    set. Developers, evaluators, quality managers and acquirers may select metrics
    from ISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>for defining requirements, evaluating software
    products, measuring quality aspects and other purposes.<br /><br />\r\nUsers of
    ISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>can select or modify and apply metrics and measures
    from ISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003 or may define application-specific metrics for their
    individual application domain.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>is
    intended to be used together with ISO/IEC 9126-1.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>contains
    an explanation of how to apply software quality metrics, a basic set of metrics
    for each subcharacteristic and an example of how to apply metrics during the software
    product life cycle.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 9126-2:2003<em></em>does not assign
    ranges of values of these metrics to rated levels or to grades of compliance,
    because these values are defined for each software product or a part of the software
    product, by its nature, depending on such factors as category of the software,
    integrity level and users' needs. Some attributes may have a desirable range of
    values, which does not depend on specific user needs but depends on generic factors;
    for example, human cognitive factors."
