    CISPR 18-3:2010(E), which is a technical report, applies to radio noise from overhead power lines and high-voltage equipment which may cause interference to radio reception, excluding the fields from power line carrier signals. The frequency range covered is 0,15 MHz to 300 MHz. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1986. It is a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    - while the first edition of CISPR 18-3 only covered recommendations for minimizing the generation of radio noise emanating from high-voltage (HV) power systems,<br />
    - this second edition now also covers a new clause providing formulae for predetermination of the radio noise field strength levels from HV overhead power lines with large conductor bundles.<br />
    Furthermore, Annex A was accomplished with a collation of predetermination formulae developed and used by several institutions  around the world. The tables also contain typical examples of radio noise field strength levels obtained during some measurements campaigns at several HV overhead power line constructions.
