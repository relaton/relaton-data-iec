abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 12207:2017 also provides processes that can be employed
    for defining, controlling, and improving software life cycle processes within
    an organization or a project.</p><p>The processes, activities, and tasks of this
    document can also be applied during the acquisition of a system that contains
    software, either alone or in conjunction with ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015,<em>Systems
    and software engineering?System life cycle processes</em>.</p><p>In the context
    of this document and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288, there is a continuum of human-made systems
    from those that use little or no software to those in which software is the primary
    interest. It is rare to encounter a complex system without software, and all software
    systems require physical system components (hardware) to operate, either as part
    of the software system-of-interest or as an enabling system or infrastructure.
    Thus, the choice of whether to apply this document for the software life cycle
    processes, or ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288:2015,<em>Systems and software engineering?System
    life cycle processes</em>, depends on the system-of-interest. Processes in both
    documents have the same process purpose and process outcomes, but differ in activities
    and tasks to perform software engineering or systems engineering, respectively.</p>"
