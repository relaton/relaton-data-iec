  content: "IEC 60794-3:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60794-3:
    2022 specifies the requirements for optical fibre cables and cable elements which
    are intended to be used externally in communications networks. Other types of
    applications requiring similar types of cables can be considered. Requirements
    for cables to be used in ducts, for directly buried applications, aerial cables
    and cables for lake and river crossings are included in this document. Also included
    are cables for specialized use in sewers and in water and gas pipes. For aerial
    application, this document does not cover all functional aspects of cables installed
    in the vicinity of overhead power lines. For such applications, additional requirements
    and test methods can be necessary. Moreover, this document excludes optical ground
    wires and cables attached to the phase or earth conductors of overhead power lines.
    For cables for lake and river crossings, this document does not cover methods
    of cable repair, nor repair capability, nor does it cover cables for use with
    underwater line amplifiers. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical change with respect to the
    previous edition: the ribbon specification has been removed, because it is covered
    in IEC 60794-1-31."
