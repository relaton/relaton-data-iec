abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63114:2018(E) describes the general principle and technical details
    of the reverse bend test method used for evaluating the ductility of electrical
    steel strip and sheet. This test method is applicable to Epstein test strip specimens
    obtained from non-oriented and grain-oriented electrical steel of any grade. The
    test specimens shall not be annealed.
