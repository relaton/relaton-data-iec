abstract:
- content: "IEC Guide 118:2017(E) is intended for technical committees and gives guidance
    on how to consider energy efficiency aspects when preparing IEC publications.<br
    />\r\nIts purpose is:<br />\r\n- to describe the contributions of IEC publications
    to energy efficiency;<br />\r\n- to describe the concept of an energy efficiency
    aspect;<br />\r\n- to provide categories of energy efficiency aspects and a list
    of energy efficiency aspects to be considered by technical committees.<br />\r\nThis
    Guide:<br />\r\n- helps in harmonizing the approach to energy efficiency;<br />\r\n-
    raises awareness that provisions in IEC publications can affect the energy performance
    of the product itself (taken individually) and of the entire application (embedding
    the product), in both negative and positive ways;<br />\r\n- helps technical committees
    to identify energy efficiency aspects that contribute to energy efficiency improvement
    of the product itself and of the entire application;<br />\r\n- promotes the use
    of a systematic approach when addressing energy efficiency in the context of standardization;<br
    />\r\n- promotes the use of a systems approach when addressing energy efficiency
    aspects in the context of standardization."
