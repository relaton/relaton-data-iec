abstract:
- content: describes the steps recommended to complete a loop check, which comprises
    the activities between the completion of the loop construction (including installation
    and point-to-point checks) and the start-up of cold commissioning. Is applicable
    for the construction of new plants and for expansion/retrofits (i.e. revamping)
    of E&I installations in existing plants (including PLC, BAS, DCS, panel-mounted
    and field instrumentation). It does not include a detailed checkout of power distribution
    systems, except as they relate to the loops being checked (i.e. a motor starter
    or a power supply to a four-wire transmitter).
