    <p>ISO/IEC 20926:2009 specifies the set of definitions, rules and steps for applying the IFPUG (International Function Point Users Group) functional size measurement (FSM) method.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 20926:2009 is conformant with all mandatory provisions of ISO/IEC 14143-1:2007. It can be applied to all functional domains and is fully convertible to prior editions of IFPUG sizing methods.</p>
    <p>IFPUG function point analysts have identified different delivery rates (hours to deliver a function point) related to building applications in different functional domains calibrated for varying project sizes and software complexities.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 20926:2009 can be applied by anyone requiring a measurement of functional size. Persons experienced with the method will find ISO/IEC 20926:2009 to be a useful reference.</p>
