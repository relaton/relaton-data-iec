  content: "IEC 60296:2012 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60296:2012 is applicable
    to specifications and test methods for unused mineral insulating oils. It applies
    to oil intended for use in transformers, switchgear and similar electrical equipment
    in which oil is required for insulation and heat transfer. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- specifications for corrosive sulphur compounds that can lead to copper
    sulphide deposition in transformers (in non-passivated and passivated oils);<br
    />\r\n- definitions of additives in oil; and<br />\r\n- re-insertion of a missing
    note on oxidation."
