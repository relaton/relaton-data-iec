abstract:
- content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol) and others. This International Standard
    features the basic fibre channel services introduced into Framing and Signalling
    (FC-FS). In addition, it describes any ancillary functions and services required
    to support the Fibre Channel services, such as name, management, discovery, time
    and alias services.
