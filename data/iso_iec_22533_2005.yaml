abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 22533:2005 defines the characteristics of 90 mm Optical Disk Cartridges
    (ODC) with a capacity of 2,3 GB per cartridge. It specifies only Type R/W for
    2 048-byte sectors of such cartridge.   Type R/W provides for data to be written,
    read and erased many times over the entire recording surface of the disk using
    the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects. It is also referred to as "fully
    rewritable". ISO/IEC 22533:2005 provides for 2 048-byte sectors only. All sectors
    on a disk are of the same size.   ISO/IEC 22533:2005 specifies:    the conditions
    for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;  the environments in which the
    cartridges are to be operated and stored;  the mechanical and physical characteristics
    of the cartridge, so as to provide mechanical interchange ability between data
    processing systems;  the format of the information on the disk, both embossed
    and user-written, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors,
    the error correction codes and the modulation method used;  the characteristics
    of the embossed information on the disk;  the magneto-optical characteristics
    of the disk, enabling processing systems to write data onto the disk;  the minimum
    quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to
    read data from the disk.     ISO/IEC 22533:2005 provides for interchange between
    optical disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it
    provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.'
