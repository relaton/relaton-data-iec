abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 22533:2005 defines the characteristics of 90 mm Optical Disk
    Cartridges (ODC) with a capacity of 2,3 GB per cartridge. It specifies only Type
    R/W for 2 048-byte sectors of such cartridge.</p><p>Type R/W provides for data
    to be written, read and erased many times over the entire recording surface of
    the disk using the thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects. It is also referred
    to as "fully rewritable". ISO/IEC 22533:2005 provides for 2 048-byte sectors only.
    All sectors on a disk are of the same size.</p><p>ISO/IEC 22533:2005 specifies:</p><ul><li>the
    conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</li><li>the environments
    in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</li><li>the mechanical
    and physical characteristics of the cartridge, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    ability between data processing systems;</li><li>the format of the information
    on the disk, both embossed and user-written, including the physical disposition
    of the tracks and sectors, the error correction codes and the modulation method
    used;</li><li>the characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;</li><li>the
    magneto-optical characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write
    data onto the disk;</li><li>the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk,
    enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    22533:2005 provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with
    a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange
    between data processing systems.</p>
