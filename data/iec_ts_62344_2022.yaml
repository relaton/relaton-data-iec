- content: "<!-- NEW! -->IEC TS 62344:2022 is available as  IEC TS 62344:2022 RLV
    \ which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    TS 62344:2022 applies to the design of earth electrode stations for high-voltage
    direct current (HVDC) links. It is intended to provide necessary guidelines, limits,
    and precautions to be followed during the design of earth electrodes to ensure
    safety of personnel and earth electrodes, and reduce any significant impacts on
    DC power transmission systems and the surrounding environment. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- Changed the requirement of earthing resistance limit for short-time unipolar
    earth system in 5.1.3.<br />\r\n- Corrected the coefficient before ρs from 0,015
    9 to 0,008 in touch voltage limit calculation formula (3) in 5.1.5.<br />\r\n-
    Deleted the analytical calculation formulas of earthing resistance for sea and
    shore electrodes in 6.1.3.<br />\r\n- Changed the current density limit from 100
    A/m2 to 40 A/m2 ~ 50 A/m2 for the sea electrodes that are not accessible to human
    beings or to marine fauna in 6.1.7.<br />\r\n- Extended some detailed technical
    requirements for the measurement of ground/water soil parameters in 6.2.5.<br
    />\r\n- Reformulated the types and characteristics of electrode element material
    for sea and shore electrodes in 6.3.2.<br />\r\n- Added an informative Annex B:
    Earth electrode design process.<br />\r\n- Added an informative Annex C: Test
    results of human body resistance.<br />\r\n- Deleted the formula for calculating
    the average soil resistivity using harmonic mean when processing the measurement
    data in D.2.6 of Annex D.<br />\r\n- Extended some detailed technical requirements
    of electrode online monitoring system in Annex H.<br />\r\n- CIGRE 675:2017 is
    added to the bibliography.<br />\r\n- Terminology and way of expressions are modified
    using more commonly used terms in the HVDC electrode design industries and English-speaking
    countries, so as to make the readers understand the content more easily."
