abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 90003:2014 provides guidance for organizations in the application
    of ISO 9001:2008 to the acquisition, supply, development, operation and maintenance
    of computer software and related support services. ISO/IEC 90003:2014 does not
    add to or otherwise change the requirements of ISO 9001:2008.<br />\r\nThe guidelines
    provided in ISO/IEC 90003:2014 are not intended to be used as assessment criteria
    in quality management system registration/certification.<br />\r\nThe application
    of ISO/IEC 90003:2014 is appropriate to software that is<br />\r\n· part of a
    commercial contract with another organization,<br />\r\n· a product available
    for a market sector,<br />\r\n· used to support the processes of an organization,<br
    />\r\n· embedded in a hardware product, or<br />\r\n· related to software services.<br
    />\r\nSome organizations may be involved in all the above activities; others may
    specialize in one area. Whatever the situation, the organization's quality management
    system should cover all aspects (software related and non-software related) of
    the business.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 90003:2014 identifies the issues that should be
    addressed and is independent of the technology, life cycle models, development
    processes, sequence of activities and organizational structure used by an organization.
    Additional guidance and frequent references to the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 software
    engineering standards are provided to assist in the application of ISO 9001:2008,
    in particular ISO/IEC 12207:2008."
