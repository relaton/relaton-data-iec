abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62786-42:2026 defines minimum requirements for AC voltage measurement
    used to control distributed energy resources (DER) and loads connected to distribution
    networks.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the characteristics of voltage magnitude
    measurement to evaluate their performances (including voltage and frequency measuring
    range, accuracy, voltage and frequency operating range, resolution, etc).<br />\r\nThis
    document describes the main use cases of voltage measurement, with associated
    level of performances.<br />\r\nThis document describes the principle of functional
    tests to evaluate the specified characteristics and defines the influencing factors
    that affect these performances, under steady state or dynamic conditions.<br />\r\nThis
    document defines the functional requirements applicable to voltage measurement
    which can be embedded inside DER or loads controller or performed as an external
    control system. In the case of DER, this document is a subpart of requirements
    which are defined in the other parts of the IEC 62786 series.<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to DER and loads regardless of voltage level at the point of connection
    to the distribution grid.<br />\r\nThis document does not specify hardware, software
    or a method for voltage measurement. It does not specify tests linked to environmental
    conditions associated to hardware devices (climatic, mechanical stress, electromagnetic
    compatibility test, etc)."
