abstract:
- content: "IEC 60172:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60172:2020
    specifies, in accordance with the provisions of IEC 60216-1, a method for evaluating
    the temperature index of enamelled wire, varnished or unvarnished with an impregnating
    agent, and of tape wrapped round and rectangular wire, in air at atmospheric pressure
    by periodically monitoring changes in response to AC proof voltage tests. This
    procedure does not apply to fibre-insulated wire or wire covered with tapes containing
    inorganic fibres. NOTE The data obtained according to this test procedure provide
    the designer and development engineer with information for the selection of winding
    wire for further evaluation of insulation systems and equipment tests. This fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2015. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of
    3.1, definition of thermal index;<br />\r\n- revision of 3.3, time to failure;<br
    />\r\n- revisions to 5.1.1 for clarity and to reduce the range wire size range
    to which the test applies;<br />\r\n- revisions to 5.1.2 for tape wrapped round
    and enamelled or tape wrapped rectangular wire for clarity;<br />\r\n- revision
    to Clause 9 to add the correlation coefficient, r to the report."
