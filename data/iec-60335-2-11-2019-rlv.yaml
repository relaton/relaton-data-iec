  content: "IEC 60335-2-11:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-11:2019
    deals with the safety of electric tumble dryers intended for household and similar
    purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances. This standard applies to the drying function of
    washing machines having a drying cycle. This standard also deals with the safety
    of tumble dryers that use a refrigerating system, incorporating sealed motor-compressors,
    for drying textile material. These appliances may use flammable refrigerants.
    Additional requirements for these appliances are given in Annex AA. Appliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms are within the scope of this standard. Examples
    of such appliances are tumble dryers for communal use in blocks of flats or in
    launderettes. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards
    presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons. However, in general,
    it does not take into account:<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n–
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements may be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour, the national water supply authorities,<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– appliances incorporating steam generating
    devices in which steam is produced at a pressure exceeding 50 kPa.<br />\r\nThis
    eighth edition cancels and replaces the seventh edition published in 2008, Amendment
    1:2012 and Amendment 2:2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    seventh edition:<br />\r\n– aligns the text with IEC 60335-1, Ed 5, and its Amendments
    1 and 2;<br />\r\n– some notes have been converted to normative text (7.12, 7.12.1,
    11.3, 19.101, AA.5.2);<br />\r\n– more detailed test specifications have been
    given in 11.3 and 15.2;<br />\r\n– specific requirements have been added in 3.1.9,
    3.6.101, 7.12, 11.7, 19.1, and Clause 22 to cover appliances with steam generators;<br
    />\r\n– specific requirements have been added in 22.108 to cover programmable
    electronic circuits;<br />\r\n– Annex AA has been deleted, because it is covered
    by Part 1 and the remaining annexes have been renumbered.<br />\r\nThis part 2
    is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments.
    It was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
