  content: "IEC 60794-1-23:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60794-1-23:2019 describes
    test procedures to be used in establishing uniform requirements for the geometrical,
    material, mechanical, environmental properties of optical fibre cable elements.
    This document applies to optical fibre cables for use with telecommunication equipment
    and devices employing similar techniques, and to cables having a combination of
    both optical fibres and electrical conductors. Throughout the document, the wording
    \"optical cable\" can also include optical fibre units, microduct fibre units,
    etc. See IEC 60794-1-2 for a reference guide to test methods of all types and
    for general requirements and definitions. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2012. It constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of a new test Method G9: Bleeding and evaporation
    (formerly known as Method E15 in IEC 60794-1-21:2015);<br />\r\n- addition of
    a new test Method G10A: Stripping force stability of cabled optical fibres (formerly
    known as Method E5A in IEC 60794-1-21:2015);<br />\r\n- addition of a new test
    Method G10B: Strippability of optical fibre ribbons (formerly known as Method
    E5B in IEC 60794-1-21:2015);<br />\r\n- addition of a new test Method G10C: Strippability
    of buffered optical fibres (formerly known as Method E5C in IEC 60794-1-21:2015);<br
    />\r\n- addition of a new test Method G11: Tensile strength and elongation of
    buffer tubes (included in IEC 60811-501);<br />\r\n- addition of a new test Method
    G12: Elongation of buffer tubes at low temperature (included in IEC 60811-505);<br
    />\r\n- clarification of the sample preparation procedure in Method G5: Ribbon
    tear (separability);<br />\r\nKeywords: optical fibre cable, optical cable test
    procedures</p>"
