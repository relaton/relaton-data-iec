abstract:
- content: "The development and delivery of smart cities involves many different systems,
    types of data, and sets of information. This complexity, and the dynamic interaction
    between the large numbers of stakeholders and city systems, makes planning and
    managing cities a great challenge. Without a tangible operational model to combine
    cross-sector data and information, the holistic, cross-boundary planning of cities,
    districts and neighbourhoods remains constrained. Therefore, new and effective
    tools are needed to enable the delivery of better city services and to make the
    urban environment more liveable, inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.<br
    /><br />\r\nCity information modelling (CIM) and urban digital twins (UDT) are
    two emerging technologies for smart cities that aim to provide such tools. Both
    offer solutions for data processing, urban analysis, design, simulation and modelling.
    They connect all involved stakeholders and actors to collaboratively deliver the
    vision of a smart city: a sustainable, inclusive, healthy, prosperous and participative
    city. They provide solutions for smart cities based on open standards and a multiscale
    and multitemporal database that integrates a wide variety of data sources presenting
    the full range of smart urban features, systems and processes.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    report is an output of the international conference,<em>Conversation between City
    Information Modelling and Urban Digital Twins: 2021 Virtual Forum</em>, organized
    by IEC SyC Smart Cities and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 41: Internet of things and digital
    twin, and held on 22-23 June 2021.<br /><br />\r\nThis IEC Technology Report is
    available for free download."
