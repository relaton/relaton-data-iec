abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18051:2004 specifies the Services and Event Reports for Computer-Supported
    Telecommunications Applications (CSTA), Phase III. It is focused on providing
    application service interfaces to a Switching Function, Computing Function and
    a Special Resource Function. A CSTA application interface is disassociated from
    the various user-network interfaces and network-network interfaces CSTA applications
    may serve, observe or manipulate. Because CSTA operates with existing telecommunications
    interfaces indirectly, it operates generically, so that differences among various
    existing interfaces are hidden from CSTA applications. Support of user-to-network
    interfaces is outside the scope of CSTA.</p><p>Although most terminal equipment
    (TE) is suitable for use with CSTA, there will be instances of TE that will not
    be suitable in certain circumstances. Examples are:</p><ul><li>FAX terminals and
    modems that are unable to adjust their transmission modes to prevent carrier conflict
    when both parties are alerted via CSTA during call establishment; and</li><li>Functional
    terminals that perform telecommunication functions outside the control of the
    Switching Function.</li></ul><p>Services defined in ISO/IEC 18051:2004 allow functional
    integration between a computing network and a telecommunications network. Computing
    platforms (i.e. Application Programming Interfaces or APIs) that support such
    functionally-integrated applications are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 18051:2004.</p><p>Communication
    between the computing and switching (i.e. telecommunications) networks may take
    place via intervening networks ranging from simple point-to-point connections
    to local or wide area telecommunications networks.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18051:2004 is
    part of a suite of CSTA International Standards and Technical Reports that provide
    a comprehensive description of the architectural and practical issues involved
    in applying, implementing and utilizing CSTA-based CTI applications.</p>"
