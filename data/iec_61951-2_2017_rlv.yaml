    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of battery type;<br />\r\n- addition
    of ‘F’ (high recovery type) designation for cells and batteries;<br />\r\n- addition
    of ‘I’ (low self-discharge type) designation for cells;<br />\r\n- revision of
    Figure 3 (6.1.3.1);<br />\r\n- addition of “optional pip” note to positive contact;<br
