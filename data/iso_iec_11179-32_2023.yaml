abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a specification for an extension to a metadata
    registry (MDR), as specified in ISO/IEC 11179-3:2023, in which metadata that describes
    concept systems can be registered.</p><p>The specification in this document, together
    with the relevant clauses of the specification in ISO/IEC 11179-3, provides the
    ability to record the following metadata:</p><ul><li>concept systems and associated
    concepts;</li><li>relations among concepts in a concept system;</li><li>assertions
    about concepts in a concept system.</li></ul><p>The metamodel in this document
    is intended to support the full description of a concept system, including ontologies.</p><p>Where
    there is a requirement to register an ontology where the details are defined elsewhere,
    consider using ISO/IEC 19763-3 instead.</p>"
