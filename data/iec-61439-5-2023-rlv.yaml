  content: "IEC 61439-5:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61439-5:2023
    defines the specific requirements for public electricity network distribution
    assemblies (PENDAs). PENDAs have the following criteria:<br />\r\n- used for the
    distribution of electrical energy in three phase systems for which the rated voltage
    does not exceed 1 000 V AC (see Figure 101 for a typical distribution network)
    and DC systems not exceeding 1 500 V DC;<br />\r\n- stationary;<br />\r\n- open
    type assemblies are not covered by this document;<br />\r\n- suitable for installation
    in places where only skilled persons have access for their use, however, outdoor
    types can be installed in situations that are accessible to ordinary persons<br
    />\r\n- intended for use in energy distribution in public power grids;<br />\r\n-
    indoor use: assemblies for installation inside of electric power substations;<br
    />\r\n- outdoor use: assemblies containing an enclosure suitable for open air
    installation.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) omission of the requirement to conduct mechanical tests at
    -25 °C when enclosures are made of a metallic material;<br />\r\nb) addition of
    assumed loading factors generation supplies and electric vehicle charging applications;<br
    />\r\nc) additional dielectric tests when a PENDA is used in a distribution substation
    with separate HV and LV earths;<br />\r\nd) further clarification of representative
    samples for design verification.<br />\r\nThe content of the corrigendum 1 (2025-02)
    has been included in this copy."
