abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard is designed to specify the processing of
    valid SGML documents.</p><p>DSSSL defines the semantics, syntax, and processing
    model of two languages for the specification of document processing:</p><p>a)
    The transformation language for transforming SGML documents marked up in accordance
    with one or more DTDs into other SGML documents marked up in accordance with other
    DTDs. The specification of this transformation process is fully defined by this
    International Standard.</p><p>b) The style language, where the result is achieved
    by applying a set of formatting characteristics to portions of the data, and the
    specification is, therefore, as precise as the application requires, leaving some
    formatting decisions, such as line-end and column-end decisions, to the composition
    and layout process.</p><p>The DSSSL style language is intended to be used in a
    wide variety of environments with typographic requirements ranging from simple
    single-column layouts to complex multipleÂ­column layouts. This International Standard
    does not standardize a formatter nor does it standardize composition or other
    processing algorithms. Rather, it provides the means whereby an implementation
    may externalize 'style characteristics' and other techniques for associating style
    information with an SGML document.</p><p>DSSSL provides a mechanism for specifying
    the use of 'external processes' to manipulate data. The nature of these processes
    is outside the scope of DSSSL, but may include typical data management functions,
    such as sorting and indexing; typical composition functions, such as hyphenation
    algorithms; and graphics or multimedia processes for non-SGML data.</p><p>Documents
    that have already been formatted or do not contain any hierarchical structural
    information or generic markup are not within the field of application of this
    International Standard.</p><p>DSSSL expresses specifications to be performed by
    some processor that accepts an input document and produces an output document.
    DSSSL is independent of the type of formatter, formatting system, or other transformation
    processor.</p><p>a) Constructs that provide access to, and control of, all possible
    marked-up information in an SGML document, as well as mechanisms for string processing
    to allow for the manipulation of non-marked up data. This is provided by the Standard
    Document Query Language (SDQL) component of DSSSL.</p><p>NOTE I String processing
    is necessary so that no special 'markers' need be embedded in the source document
    to indicate presentational changes. The display of a dropped or raised capital
    letter in a larger point size at the beginning of a line or paragraph is an example
    of a case where string processing may be used to isolate the first character or
    group of characters in order to achieve a desired presentational effect.</p><p>b)
    Provisions for specifying the relationship between one or more SGML documents
    as input to a transformation process and zero or more resulting SGML documents
    as the output of the process.</p><p>c) Provisions for specifying the relationships
    between the SGML document(s), as expressed in the source Document Type Definition(s),
    and the result of the formatting process. The output of the formatting process
    may be an 1SO/IEC l 0 180 Standard Page Description Language (SPDL) document or
    it may be a document in some other, possibly proprietary, form.</p><p>d) Provisions
    for describing the typographic style and layout of a document.</p><p>e) Definitions
    of a machine-processable syntax for the representation of a DSSSL specification
    and its various components.</p><p>f) Provisions for creating new DSSSL characteristics
    and their associated values, as well as new flow object classes. These are declared
    in the declarations for the style language portion of the DSSSL specification.</p><p></p><p>This
    International Standard is intended for use in a wide variety of SGML application
    environments, including both electronic publishing and conventional printing.</p>"
