  content: "IEC 60227-1:2024 applies to rigid and flexible cables with insulation,
    and sheath if any, based on polyvinyl chloride, of rated voltages Uo/U up to and
    including 450/750 V used in power installations of nominal voltage not exceeding
    450/750 V AC.<br />\r\nNOTE For some types of flexible cables the term \"cord\"
    is used.<br />\r\nThe particular types of cables are specified in IEC 60227-3,
    IEC 60227-4, IEC 60227-5, IEC 60227-6 and IEC 60227-7. The code designations of
    these types of cables are provided in this document. The test methods specified
    in this document, IEC 60227-3, IEC 60227-4, IEC 60227-5, IEC 60227-6 and IEC 60227-7
    are given in IEC 63294, IEC 60332-1-2 and in the relevant parts of the IEC 60811
