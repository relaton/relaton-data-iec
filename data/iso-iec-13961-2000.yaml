  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />The scalable coherent interface (SCI)
    provides computer-bus-like services but, instead of a bus, uses a collection of
    fast point-to-point unidirectional links to provide the far higher throughput
    needed for high-performance multiprocessor systems. SCI supports distributed,
    shared memory with optional cache coherence for tightly coupled systems, and message-passing
    for loosely coupled systems. Initial SCI links are defined at 1 Gbyte&#x2F;s (16-bit
    parallel) and 1 Gb&#x2F;s (serial). For applications requiring modular packaging,
    an interchangeable module is specified along with connector and power. The packets
    and protocols that implement transactions are defined and their formal specification
    is provided in the form of computer programs. In addition to the usual read-and-write
    transactions, SCI supports efficient multiprocessor lock transactions. The distributed
    cache-coherence protocols are efficient and can recover from an arbitrary number
    of transmission failures. SCI protocols ensure forward progress despite multiprocessor
    conflicts (no deadlocks or starvation).
