abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC TR 18037:2004 specifies a series of extensions of the programming
    language C (as specified by ISO/IEC 9899:1999) to support features commonly found
    in embedded processors.ISO/IEC TR 18037:2004 deals with the following topics:
    extensions to support fixed-point arithmetic, named address spaces, and basic
    I/O hardware addressing. Each topic begins with a technical description of its
    features and ends with the editorial changes to ISO/IEC 9899:1999 necessary to
    fully specify the topic, and thereby provides a complete definition. Additional
    explanation and rationale are provided in annexes.'
