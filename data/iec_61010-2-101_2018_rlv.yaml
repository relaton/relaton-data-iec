    applies to equipment intended for in vitro diagnostic (IVD) medical purposes,
    including self-test IVD medical purposes. It has the status of a group safety
    publication, as specified in IEC Guide 104. This document has been prepared in
    close collaboration with Working Group CENELEC BTTF 88.1. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- adaptation of changes
    introduced by Amendment 1 of IEC 61010-1;<br />\r\n- added tolerance for stability
    of AC voltage test equipment to Clause 6.<br />\r\nThis Part 2-101 is intended
    to be used in conjunction with IEC 61010-1. It was established on the basis of
    the third edition (2010) and its Amendment 1 (2016).</p>"
