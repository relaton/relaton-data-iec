abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 21000-7:2007 specifies the syntax and semantics of tools that
    may be used to assist the adaptation of Digital Items, i.e. the Digital Item Declaration
    and resources referenced by the declaration. Users can use the tools to satisfy
    transmission, storage and consumption constraints, as well as Quality of Service
    management.<br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 21000-7:2007 specifies tools to describe:<br
    /><br />\r\nuser characteristics, terminal capabilities, network characteristics
    and natural environment characteristics;<br />\r\nthe high-level syntax of a binary
    media resource, media resource and XML streaming instructions, and properties
    style sheet;<br />\r\nthe relationship between Quality of Service constraints,
    feasible adaptation operations satisfying these constraints and associated media
    resource qualities that result from adaptation:<br />\r\nlimitation and optimization
    constraints on adaptations;<br />\r\nmeans for linking adaptation decisions with
    actual media resource adaptation engines;<br />\r\nmetadata adaptation hint information;<br
    />\r\nconfiguration-state information of a Digital Item;<br />\r\ninformation
    required for the configuration of an adaptation engine; and<br />\r\npermitted
    changes and change constraints.<br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 21000-7:2007
    does not specify the adaptation engines themselves."
