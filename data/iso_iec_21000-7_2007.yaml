abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 21000-7:2007 specifies the syntax and semantics of tools that
    may be used to assist the adaptation of Digital Items, i.e. the Digital Item Declaration
    and resources referenced by the declaration. Users can use the tools to satisfy
    transmission, storage and consumption constraints, as well as Quality of Service
    management.</p><p>ISO/IEC 21000-7:2007 specifies tools to describe:</p><ul><li>user
    characteristics, terminal capabilities, network characteristics and natural environment
    characteristics;</li><li>the high-level syntax of a binary media resource, media
    resource and XML streaming instructions, and properties style sheet;</li><li>the
    relationship between Quality of Service constraints, feasible adaptation operations
    satisfying these constraints and associated media resource qualities that result
    from adaptation:</li><li>limitation and optimization constraints on adaptations;</li><li>means
    for linking adaptation decisions with actual media resource adaptation engines;</li><li>metadata
    adaptation hint information;</li><li>configuration-state information of a Digital
    Item;</li><li>information required for the configuration of an adaptation engine;
    and</li><li>permitted changes and change constraints.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 21000-7:2007
    does not specify the adaptation engines themselves.</p>"
