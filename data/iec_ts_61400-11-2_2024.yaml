abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61400-11-2:2024 presents measurement procedures, that enable the
    sound characteristics of a wind turbine to be determined at receptor (immission)
    locations. This involves using measurement methods appropriate to sound immission
    assessment at far-field locations of a wind turbine or wind farm. The procedures
    described are different in some respects from those that would be used for noise
    assessment from other industrial sound sources in environmental noise impact assessments.
    The procedures present methodologies that will enable the sound immission and
    sound characteristics of wind turbines to be described in a consistent and accurate
    manner.
