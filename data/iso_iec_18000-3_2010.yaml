abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 18000 has been developed in order to:    provide a framework to
    define common communications protocols for Internationally useable frequencies
    for radio frequency identification (RFID), and, where possible, to determine the
    use of the same protocols for all frequencies such that the problems of migrating
    from one to another are diminished;    minimize software and implementation costs;    enable
    system management and control and information exchange to be common as far as
    is possible.     ISO/IEC 18000-1 provides explanation of the concepts behind ISO/IEC
    18000-3:2010.  ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010 has 3 MODES of operation, intended to address
    different applications. The detailed technical differences between the modes are
    shown in parameter tables.  ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010 provides physical layer, collision
    management system and protocol values for RFID systems for item identification
    operating at 13,56 MHz in accordance with the requirements of ISO/IEC 18000-1.  It
    provides definitions for systems for each MODE determined in ISO/IEC 18000-3:2010.  It
    defines three non-interfering MODES.    The MODES are not interoperable.   The
    MODES, whilst not interoperable, are non-interfering.'
