  content: "IEC TR 62001-1:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, provides guidance
    on the specifications of AC filters for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems
    with line-commutated converters and filter performance calculation. This document
    deals with the specification and design evaluation of AC side harmonic performance
    and AC side filters for HVDC schemes. It is intended to be primarily for the use
    of the utilities and consultants who are responsible for issuing the specifications
    for new HVDC projects and evaluating designs proposed by prospective suppliers.
    The scope of this document covers AC side filtering for the frequency range of
    interest in terms of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances. It
    excludes filters designed to be effective in the Power Line Carrier (PLC) and
    radio interference spectra. The bulk of this document concentrates on the \"conventional\"
    AC filter technology and line-commutated HVDC converters. The changes entailed
    by new technologies are also discussed. This first edition of IEC TR 62001-1,
    together with IEC TR 62001-2, IEC TR 62001-3 and IEC TR 62001-4, cancels and replaces
    IEC TR 62001 published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    IEC TR 62001-1 includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to IEC TR 62001:<br />\r\na) Clauses 3 to 5, 7 to 9, 17, 20, Annexes A and C to
    E have been expanded and supplemented;<br />\r\nb) Annexes C and F on the definition
    of telephone interference parameters and voltage sourced converters have been
    added."
