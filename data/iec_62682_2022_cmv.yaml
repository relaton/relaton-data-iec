abstract:
- content: "IEC 62682:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62682:2022 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62682:2014
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 65A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62682:2022 specifies general principles and processes for the
    management of alarm systems based on controls system and human-machine interfaces
    (HMI) for facilities in the process industries. It covers all alarms to be presented
    to the operator through the control system, which includes alarms from basic process
    control systems, annunciators, packaged systems, and safety instrumented systems.<br
    />\r\nThe practices in this document are applicable to continuous, batch, and
    discrete processes. There can be differences in implementation to meet the specific
    needs based on process type.<br />\r\nThe primary function within the alarm system
    is to notify operators of abnormal process conditions or equipment malfunctions
    and support the response. The alarm systems can include both the basic process
    control system (BPCS) and the safety instrumented system (SIS), each of which
    uses measurements of process conditions and logic to generate alarms. Figure 1
    illustrates the concepts of alarm and response dataflow through the alarm system.
    The alarm system also includes a mechanism for communicating the alarm information
    to the operator via an HMI, usually a computer screen or an annunciator. Additional
    functions of the alarm system are an alarm and event log, an alarm historian,
    and the generation of performance metrics for the alarm system. There are external
    systems that can use the data from the alarm system."
