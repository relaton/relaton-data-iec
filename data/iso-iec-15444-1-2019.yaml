    <p>This Recommendation | International Standard defines a set of lossless (bit-preserving) and lossy compression methods for coding bi-level, continuous-tone grey-scale, palletized colour, or continuous-tone colour digital still images.</p>
    <p>This Recommendation | International Standard:</p>
    <p>?     specifies decoding processes for converting compressed image data to reconstructed image data;</p>
    <p>?     specifies a codestream syntax containing information for interpreting the compressed image data;</p>
    <p>?     specifies a file format;</p>
    <p>?     provides guidance on encoding processes for converting source image data to compressed image data;</p>
    <p>?     provides guidance on how to implement these processes in practice.</p>
    <p>NOTE ? As this specification was first published as common text only after ISO/IEC JTC1 had approved the first edition in 2000, edition numbers in the ITU and ISO/IEC versions are offset by one. This is the third edition of ITU-T T.800 and the fourth edition of ISO/IEC 15444-1.</p>
