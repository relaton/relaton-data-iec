abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    18092:2013 defines communication modes for Near Field Communication Interface
    and Protocol (NFCIP 1) using inductive coupled devices operating at the centre
    frequency of 13,56 MHz for interconnection of computer peripherals. It also defines
    both the Active and the Passive communication modes of Near Field Communication
    Interface and Protocol (NFCIP-1) to realize a communication network using Near
    Field Communication devices for networked products and also for consumer equipment.
    ISO/IEC 18092:2013 specifies, in particular, modulation schemes, codings, transfer
    speeds, and frame format of the RF interface, as well as initialization schemes
    and conditions required for data collision control during initialization. Furthermore,
    ISO/IEC 18092:2013 defines a transport protocol including protocol activation
    and data exchange methods."
