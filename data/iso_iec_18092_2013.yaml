abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18092:2013 defines communication modes for Near Field Communication
    Interface and Protocol (NFCIP 1) using inductive coupled devices operating at
    the centre frequency of 13,56 MHz for interconnection of computer peripherals.
    It also defines both the Active and the Passive communication modes of Near Field
    Communication Interface and Protocol (NFCIP-1) to realize a communication network
    using Near Field Communication devices for networked products and also for consumer
    equipment. ISO/IEC 18092:2013 specifies, in particular, modulation schemes, codings,
    transfer speeds, and frame format of the RF interface, as well as initialization
    schemes and conditions required for data collision control during initialization.
    Furthermore, ISO/IEC 18092:2013 defines a transport protocol including protocol
    activation and data exchange methods.</p>"
