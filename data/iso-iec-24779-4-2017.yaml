    <p>ISO/IEC 24779-4:2017 contains a set of symbols, icons and pictograms to help the general public understand the concepts and procedures for using electronic systems that collect and/or process fingerprints. This set of symbols, icons and pictograms is designed to be used to</p>
    <p>-      identify the type of biometric device,</p>
    <p>-      provide static instructions related to a fingerprint device,</p>
    <p>-      display dynamic real-time information related to the fingerprint device, and</p>
    <p>-      indicate the status of the fingerprint device.</p>
    <p>To provide this functionality, the set of symbols, icons and pictograms includes both directional symbols, icons and pictograms and real-time action or feedback symbols, icons and pictograms. The fingerprint device symbols, icons and pictograms can be categorized as</p>
    <p>-      finger/hand general biometric,</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      kind of finger, four fingers or hand device,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>-      finger/hand placement,</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      biometric position and impression which needs to be presented next,</li>
    <li>-      hand orientation (switched hands),</li>
    </ul>
    <p>-      finger/hand quality feedback,</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      press (more or less),</li>
    <li>-      raise/lower angle,</li>
    </ul>
    <p>-      finger/hand positioning,</p>
    <ul>
    <li>-      hand/finger orientation,</li>
    <li>-      necessary finger/hand movement (forward, backward, lateral),</li>
    <li>-      rotation,</li>
    <li>-      change angle, and</li>
    <li>-      rolling finger(s).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although the symbols, icons and pictograms are presented individually, it is intended that the symbols, icons and pictograms be combined to fully illustrate the fingerprinting interaction.</p>
    <p>Alternative illustrations might be used; for example, in a customs or immigration environment, procedures constructed from the individual symbols, icons and pictograms could additionally be presented as</p>
    <p>-      a series of posters while waiting to use the biometric system,</p>
    <p>-      a series of transitional frames in a biometric booth,</p>
    <p>-      an animated video or series of transitional frames while waiting to use the biometric system, and</p>
    <p>-      instructional leaflets to read while waiting to use the biometric system.</p>
    <p>This multi-part International standard focuses on communication with the data capture subject. Operators could use this International standard, but they might need additional symbols and information.</p>
