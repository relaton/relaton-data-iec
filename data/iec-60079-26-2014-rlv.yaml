  content: "IEC 60079-26:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60079-26:2014 specifies
    alternative requirements for construction, test and marking for electrical equipment
    that provides Equipment Protection Level (EPL) Ga when single standardised Types
    of Protection (e.g. Ex \"ia\", Ex \"ma\", Ex \"da\") cannot be applied. This standard
    also applies to equipment mounted across a boundary where different Equipment
    Protection Levels may be required. This electrical equipment, within the operational
    parameters specified by the manufacturer, ensures a very high Level of Protection
    that includes rare malfunctions related to the equipment or two malfunctions occurring
    independently of each other. This standard supplements and modifies the general
    requirements of IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement of this standard conflicts with
    a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the requirement of this standard takes precedence.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2006 and
    constitutes a technical revision. The numerous changes are identified in the Foreword
    of the document.<br />\r\nKeywords: Equipment Protection Level (EPL) Ga"
