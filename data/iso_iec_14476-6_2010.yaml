abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 14476-6:2010 provides a specification of QoS management for accomplishing
    a desired quality of service in n-plex multicast transport connections. For this
    purpose, it describes the QoS management operations in n-plex multicast transport
    connections such as QoS negotiation, QoS monitoring and QoS maintenance. ISO/IEC
    14476-6:2010 is an integral part of ECTP-5 (ITU-T Rec. X.608 ISO/IEC 14476-5).
    All of the protocol components, including packet formats and protocol procedures
    specified in ITU-T Rec. X.608 ISO/IEC 14476-5, are also valid in ISO/IEC 14476-6:2010.
