abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17344:2006 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of 120 mm recordable optical disks with capacities of 4,7 Gbytes and 9,4 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written once and read many times using
    a non-reversible method. These disks are identified as +R.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17344:2006
    also specifies 80 mm disks with capacities of 1,46 Gbytes and 2,92 Gbytes. These
    disks have the same characteristics as the 120 mm disks, except for some parameters
    related to the smaller dimensions.</p><p>ISO/IEC 17344:2006 specifies:</p><ul><li>two
    related but different Types of this disk;</li><li>the conditions for conformance;</li><li>the
    environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored;</li><li>the
    mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide
    mechanical interchange between data processing systems;</li><li>the format of
    the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks
    and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method; and</li><li>the
    characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing
    systems to read the data from the disk.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 17344:2006 provides
    for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems.</p>"
