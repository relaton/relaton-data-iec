  content: ISO/IEC TR 11801-9903:2015(E) establishes a matrix-model for formulating
    limits for differential mode parameters for return loss, insertion loss, and near
    and far end crosstalk, within and between two pairs of balanced cabling. This
    is for the purpose of supporting new, improved balanced cabling channel and link
    specifications, which are expected to be included in the next edition of ISO/IEC
    11801.
