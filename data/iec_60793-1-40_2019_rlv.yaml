abstract:
- content: "IEC 60793-1-40:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60793-1-40:2019
    establishes uniform requirements for measuring the attenuation of optical fibre,
    thereby assisting in the inspection of fibres and cables for commercial purposes.
    Four methods are described for measuring attenuation, one being that for modelling
    spectral attenuation:<br />\r\n– method A: cut-back;<br />\r\n– method B: insertion
    loss;<br />\r\n– method C: backscattering;<br />\r\n– method D: modelling spectral
    attenuation.<br />\r\nMethods A to C apply to the measurement of attenuation for
    all categories of the following fibres:<br />\r\n– class A multimode fibres;<br
    />\r\n– class B single-mode fibres.<br />\r\nMethod C, backscattering, also covers
    the location, losses and characterization of point discontinuities. Method D is
    applicable only to class B fibres. Information common to all four methods appears
    in Clauses 1 to 11, and information pertaining to each individual method appears
    in Annexes A, B, C, and D, respectively. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2001. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Improvement of the description of measurement
    details for B6 fibre;<br />\r\nb) Improvement of the calibration requirements
    for A4 fibre;<br />\r\nc) Introduction of Annex E describing examples of short
    cable test results on A1 multimode fibres.<br />\r\nKeywords: measuring the attenuation
    of optical fibre"
