abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    8473-2:1996 Differs from the other related International Standards by the layers
    defined in ISO/IEC 7498-1. In particular, it defines the way in which a local
    area network that conforms to ISO/IEC 8802 may be used as a subnetwork within
    the network layer to provide the abstract underlying service with respect to which
    the protocol defined by ISO/IEC 8473-1 is specified."
