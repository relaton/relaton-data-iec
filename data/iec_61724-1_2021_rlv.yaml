abstract:
- content: "IEC 61724-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61724-1:2021
    outlines terminology, equipment, and methods for performance monitoring and analysis
    of photovoltaic (PV) systems. It also serves as a basis for other standards which
    rely upon the data collected. This document defines classes of photovoltaic (PV)
    performance monitoring systems and serves as guidance for monitoring system choices.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition, published in 2017.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Monitoring of bifacial systems is introduced.<br
    />\r\n- Irradiance sensor requirements are updated.<br />\r\n- Soiling measurement
    is updated based on new technology.<br />\r\n- Class C monitoring systems are
    eliminated.<br />\r\n- Various requirements, recommendations and explanatory notes
    are updated."
