    <p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a series of related 130 mm optical disk</p>
    <p>cartridges (ODCs) by using a number of Type designations.</p>
    <p>A disk has two sides, called Side A and Side B. Each side can have a nominal capacity of 2,6 Gbytes.</p>
    <p><b>Type R/W </b>provides for data to be written, read and erased many times over the</p>
    <p>recording surface of the corresponding disk side, using the thermo-magnetic</p>
    <p>and magneto-optical effects.</p>
    <p><b>Type P-ROM </b>provides for a part of the disk surface to be pre-recorded and reproduced by</p>
    <p>stamping or other means. This part of the disk is read without recourse to</p>
    <p>the magneto-optical effect. All parts which are not pre-recorded provide for</p>
    <p>data to meet the requirements of Type R/W.</p>
    <p><b>Type O-ROM </b>provides for the whole of the disk surface to be pre-recorded and reproduced</p>
    <p>by stamping or other means. The corresponding disk sides are read without</p>
    <p>recourse to the magneto-optical effect.</p>
    <p><b>Type DOW </b>provides for data to be written and read many times over the recording</p>
    <p>surface of the corresponding disk side, using the direct overwrite thermomagnetic</p>
    <p>and magneto-optical effects requiring a single external magnetic</p>
    <p>field.</p>
    <p><b>Type P-DOW </b>provides for a part of the disk surface to be pre-recorded and reproduced by</p>
    <p>stamping or other means. This part of the disk is read without recourse to</p>
    <p>the magneto-optical effect. All parts which are not pre-recorded provide for</p>
    <p>data to meet the requirements of Type DOW.</p>
    <p><b>Type WO </b>provides write once, read multiple functionality using the thermo-magnetic</p>
    <p>and magneto-optical effects.</p>
    <p><b>Type WO-DOW </b>provides write once, read multiple functionality using the direct overwrite</p>
    <p>thermo-magnetic and magneto-optical effects.</p>
    <p>In addition, for each Type, this International Standard provides for cartridges containing a disk with a</p>
    <p>sector size of 512 bytes, cartridges containing a disk with a sector size of 1 024 bytes and cartridges</p>
    <p>containing a disk with a sector size of 2 048 bytes. All sectors of a disk are the same size.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>- the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</p>
    <p>- the environments in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</p>
    <p>- the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge, so as to</p>
    <p>provide mechanical interchangeability between data processing systems;</p>
    <p>- the format of the information on the disk, both embossed and user-written, including</p>
    <p>the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correction codes, the</p>
    <p>modulation methods used;</p>
    <p>- the characteristics of the embossed information on the disk;</p>
    <p>- the magneto-optical characteristics of the disk, enabling processing systems to write</p>
    <p>data onto the disk;</p>
    <p>- the minimum quality of user-written data on the disk, enabling data processing</p>
    <p>systems to read data from the disk.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together with a</p>
    <p>Standard for volume and file structure it provides for full data interchange between data processing</p>
    <p>systems.</p>
