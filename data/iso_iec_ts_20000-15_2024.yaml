abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 20000-15:2024 This document provides guidance on the relationship
    between ISO/IEC 20000-1:2018 and two commonly used frameworks, Agile and DevOps.
    It can be used by any organization or person wishing to understand how Agile and
    DevOps can be used with ISO/IEC 20000-1, including:<br />\r\na) an organization
    that has demonstrated or intends to demonstrate conformity to the requirements
    specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1 and is seeking guidance on the use of Agile or DevOps
    to establish or improve the SMS and the services;<br />\r\nb) an organization
    that already uses Agile or DevOps and is seeking guidance on how Agile or DevOps
    can be used to support efforts to demonstrate conformity to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 20000-1;<br />\r\nc) an assessor or auditor who wishes to understand
    the use of Agile or DevOps as a support for achieving the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 20000-1.<br />\r\nBoth approaches can be used independently or together.
    Depending on the context, an organization can deploy Agile frameworks only, DevOps
    frameworks only, use both Agile and DevOps frameworks in isolation, or use an
    integrated workflow with combined Agile and DevOps approaches. In any of these
    situations, this document can be used as guidance for the integration of Agile
    and DevOps practices in an SMS.<br />\r\nThe guidance in this document can assist
    an organization in planning and preparing for a conformity assessment against
    ISO/IEC 20000-1, noting that an organization can only claim conformity by fulfilling
    all requirements specified in ISO/IEC 20000-1."
