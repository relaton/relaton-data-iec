abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 2375:2003 specifies the procedures to be followed for preparing,
    maintaining, and publishing a register of escape sequences and of the coded character
    sets they identify.</p><p>The registration process specified in ISO/IEC 2375:2003
    is<em>not</em>a procedure for standardization of characters or coded character
    sets. Organizations that wish ISO and/or IEC to create an international standard
    for a coded character set or that wish ISO and/or IEC to code additional characters
    into ISO/IEC 10646 need to follow the ISO/IEC procedures for doing so.</p><p>In
    particular,</p><ul><li>Registration of a coded character set according to the
    procedures specified by ISO/IEC 2375:2003 implies no commitment by ISO and/or
    IEC to adopt the coded character set as an ISO/IEC standard.</li><li>The existence
    of a character in an approved registration does not imply a commitment by ISO
    and/or IEC to encode that character into ISO/IEC 10646.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 2022
    describes the escape sequences referenced in ISO/IEC 2375:2003, except for escape
    sequences reserved in ISO/IEC 2022 for private use.</p><p>The use of these escape
    sequences includes code extension, that is, the provision of additional sets of
    characters, or of additional control functions, in accordance with ISO/IEC 2022.</p><p>An
    escape sequence registered in accordance with ISO/IEC 2375:2003 serves as an identification
    of the character, the set of characters, or the control function associated with
    it in the register.</p><p>The registration itself does not specify the rules in
    accordance with which a character or character set identified by an escape sequence
    is to be used. Rather, the registration identifies the documents (for example,
    standards) which specify such rules.</p>"
