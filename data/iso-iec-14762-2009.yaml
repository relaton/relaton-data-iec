  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO/IEC 14762:2009(E) specifies the
    general functional safety requirements for HBES following the principles of the
    basic standard for functional safety IEC 61508. This International Standard sets
    the requirements for functional safety for Home and Building Electronic Systems
    (HBES) products and systems, a multi-application bus system where the functions
    are decentralised, distributed and linked through a common communication process.
    The requirements may also apply to the distributed functions of any equipment
    connected in a home or building control system if no specific functional safety
    standard exists for this equipment or system. This International Standard only
    addresses HBES products. HBES and HES products in this International Standard
    are for non-safety related applications.
