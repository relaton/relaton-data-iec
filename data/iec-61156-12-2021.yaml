  content: "IEC 61156-12:2021 describes cables intended to be used for transmission
    of 1 Gbit/s over a single twisted pair for office, home and industrial application.
    An example of an existing application is 1000BASE-T1; see ISO/IEC TR 11801-9906.
    The transmission characteristics of these cables are specified up to a frequency
    of 600 MHz and at a temperature of 20 °C. The cable type recognised is intended
    to be used for the work area wiring of shielded channels with a nominal length
    of 40 m. Possible designs are U/FTP, X/UTP and X/FTP, where X stands for F, S
    or SF.<br />\r\nThe cables covered by this document are intended to operate with
    voltages and currents normally encountered in communication systems. While these
    cables are not intended to be used in conjunction with low impedance sources,
    e.g. the electric power supplies of public utility mains, they are intended to
    be used to support the delivery of low voltage remote powering applications."
