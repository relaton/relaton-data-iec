abstract:
- content: "IEC 61300-3-30:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-30:2020
    describes a method of measuring the end face geometry of rectangular multifibre
    ferrules having an IEC defined optical interface. The primary attributes are fibre
    position relative to the end face, either withdrawal or protrusion, end face angle
    relative to the guide pin bores, fibre tip radii and core dip for multimode fibres.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    measurement of the individual fibre tip radii;<br />\r\n- introduction of the
    geometry limit (GL) metric;<br />\r\n- introduction of the minus coplanarity metric;<br
    />\r\n- new method for measuring the core dips;<br />\r\n- all measurement regions
    are now identical for MM and SM fibres;<br />\r\n- the ferrule surface angle sign
    convention has been changed."
