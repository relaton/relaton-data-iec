abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 11694-1:2005 is one of a series of International Standards
    defining the parameters for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for
    the storage and interchange of digital data.</p><p>ISO/IEC 11694 recognizes the
    existence of different methods of recording and reading information on optical
    memory cards, the characteristics of which are specific to the recording method
    employed. ISO/IEC 11694-1:2005 is specific to optical memory cards using the linear
    recording method. It defines the physical characteristics and the extent of compliance
    with, addition to and/or deviation from the relevant base document ISO/IEC 11693.</p>"
