abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000-7:2014 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating as an active RF tag in the 433 MHz band used in item
    management applications. It provides a common technical specification for RFID
    devices that can be used by ISO technical committees developing RFID application
    standards. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2014 is intended to allow for compatibility and to
    encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international
    marketplace. It defines the forward and return link parameters for technical attributes
    including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating channel accuracy,
    occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power, spurious emissions, modulation, duty
    cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission order, and,
    where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence, spreading
    sequence, and chip rate. It further defines the communications protocol used in
    the air interface.
