    <p>This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120 mm</p>
    <p>rewritable optical disks with capacities of 3,0 Gbytes and 6,0 Gbytes. It specifies the quality of the recorded and</p>
    <p>unrecorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange</p>
    <p>by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many times using the phase change</p>
    <p>method. These disks are identified as +RW.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>_ two related but different Types of this disk (see clause 7),</p>
    <p>_ the conditions for conformance,</p>
    <p>_ the environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored,</p>
    <p>_ the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange</p>
    <p>between data processing systems,</p>
    <p>_ the format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error</p>
    <p>correcting codes and the coding method,</p>
    <p>_ the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to read the data</p>
    <p>from the disk.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a</p>
    <p>standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
