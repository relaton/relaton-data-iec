abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 25024:2015 defines data quality measures for quantitatively
    measuring the data quality in terms of characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 25012.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    25024:2015 contains the following:</p><p>- a basic set of data quality measures
    for each characteristic;</p><p>- a basic set of target entities to which the quality
    measures are applied during the data-life-cycle;</p><p>- an explanation of how
    to apply data quality measures;</p><p>- a guidance for organizations defining
    their own measures for data quality requirements and evaluation.</p><p>It includes,
    as informative annexes, a synoptic table of quality measure elements defined in
    this International standard (Annex A), a table of quality measures associated
    to each quality measure element and target entitiy (Annex B), considerations about
    specific quality measure elements (Annex C), a list of quality measures in alphabetic
    order (Annex D), and a table of quality measures grouped by characteristics and
    target entities (Annex E).</p><p>This International Standard does not define ranges
    of values of these quality measures to rate levels or grades because these values
    are defined for each system by its nature depending on the system context and
    users' needs.</p><p>This International Standard can be applied to any kind of
    data retained in a structured format within a computer system used for any kinds
    of applications.</p><p>People managing data and services including data are the
    primary beneficiaries of the quality measures.</p><p>This International Standard
    is intended to be used by people who need to produce and/or use data quality measures
    while pursuing their responsibilities.</p><p>- Acquirer (an individual or organization
    that acquires or procures data from a supplier).</p><p>- Evaluator (an individual
    or organization that performs an evaluation, which can, for example, be a testing
    laboratory, the quality department of an organization, a government organization,
    or a user).</p><p>- Developer (an individual or organization that performs development
    activities including requirements, analysis, design, implementation, and testing
    data during the data-life-cycle).</p><p>- Maintainer (an individual or organization
    that performs operation and maintenance activities of data).</p><p>- Supplier
    (an individual or organization that enters into a contract with the acquirer for
    the supply of data or service under the terms of the contract).</p><p>- User (an
    individual or organization that uses data to perform a specific function).</p><p>-
    Quality manager (an individual or organization that performs a systematic examination
    of the data).</p><p>- Owner (an individual or organization that takes responsibility
    for the management and financial value of the data with the legal authority and
    responsibility to establish for them evaluation, collections, access, dissemination,
    storage, security, and cancellation).</p><p>ISO/IEC 25024:2015 takes into account
    a large range of data of target entities.</p><p>It can be applied in many types
    of information systems, for example, such as follows:</p><p>- legacy information
    system;</p><p>- data warehouse;</p><p>- distributed information system;</p><p>-
    cooperative information system;</p><p>- world wide web.</p><p>The scope does not
    include the following:</p><p>- knowledge representation;</p><p>- data mining techniques;</p><p>-
    statistical significance for random sample.</p>"
