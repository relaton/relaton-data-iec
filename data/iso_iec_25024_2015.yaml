abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 25024:2015 defines data quality measures for quantitatively measuring
    the data quality in terms of characteristics defined in ISO/IEC 25012.This International
    Standard contains the following:<br />\r\n- a basic set of data quality measures
    for each characteristic;<br />\r\n- a basic set of target entities to which the
    quality measures are applied during the data-life-cycle;<br />\r\n- an explanation
    of how to apply data quality measures;<br />\r\n- a guidance for organizations
    defining their own measures for data quality requirements and evaluation.<br />\r\nIt
    includes, as informative annexes, a synoptic table of quality measure elements
    defined in this International standard (Annex A), a table of quality measures
    associated to each quality measure element and target entitiy (Annex B), considerations
    about specific quality measure elements (Annex C), a list of quality measures
    in alphabetic order (Annex D), and a table of quality measures grouped by characteristics
    and target entities (Annex E).<br />\r\nThis International Standard does not define
    ranges of values of these quality measures to rate levels or grades because these
    values are defined for each system by its nature depending on the system context
    and users' needs.<br />\r\nThis International Standard can be applied to any kind
    of data retained in a structured format within a computer system used for any
    kinds of applications.<br />\r\nPeople managing data and services including data
    are the primary beneficiaries of the quality measures."
