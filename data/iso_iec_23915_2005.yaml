abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 23915:2005 specifies signalling interworking between "QSIG"
    and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) in support of call diversion within
    corporate telecommunication networks (CN), also known as enterprise networks.</p><p>"QSIG"
    is a signalling protocol that operates between Private Integrated services Network
    eXchanges (PINX) within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN). A PISN provides
    circuit-switched basic services and supplementary services to its users.</p><p>SIP
    is an application layer protocol for establishing, terminating and modifying multimedia
    sessions. It is typically carried over IP.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23915:2005 specifies
    signalling interworking for call diversion during the establishment of calls between
    a PISN employing QSIG and a corporate IP network employing SIP. It covers both
    the impact on SIP of call diversion in the QSIG network and the impact on QSIG
    of request retargeting in the SIP network.</p><p>ISO/IEC 23915:2005 is applicable
    to any interworking unit that can act as a gateway between a PISN employing QSIG
    and a corporate IP network employing SIP.</p>
