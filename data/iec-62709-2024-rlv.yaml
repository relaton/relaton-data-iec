  content: "IEC 62709:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62709:2024
    applies to security screening systems that utilize X-ray radiation and are used
    to inspect people who are not inside vehicles, containers, or enclosures. Specifically,
    this document applies to systems used to detect objects carried on or within the
    body of the individual being inspected. The objective is to provide standard methods
    of measuring and reporting imaging quality characteristics that enable system
    manufacturers, potential system users and other interested parties to:<br />\r\na)
    Establish a consistent indicator of the expected technical performance of screening
    systems used for the inspection of individuals. Such technical performance testing
    complements explicit detection testing and evaluation. In this document \"detection\"
    refers to items in an image.<br />\r\nb) Provide repeatable and verifiable imaging
    performance data that can be used to compare systems from different vendors.<br
    />\r\nc) Establish a baseline that can be used over time to calibrate the system
    or detect any performance degradation. (It is not intended that the entire test
    method be employed for daily quality assurance testing.)<br />\r\nd) Establish
    minimum acceptable performance requirements for the systems described above.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2014. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Clarified the test procedures to maintain
    consistency with IEC 62463.<br />\r\nb) Changed the term \"spatial resolution\"
    to \"pentalith resolution\".<br />\r\nc) Modified some standard test conditions.<br
    />\r\nd) Modified some terms and definitions.<br />\r\ne) Changed the imaging
    requirements for transmission general-use systems."
