  content: "IEC PAS 62840-3:2021 applies to battery swap systems for removable RESS
    of electric road vehicle when connected to the supply network, with a rated supply
    voltage up to 480 V AC or up to 400 V DC, for battery systems with a rated voltage
    up to 120 V DC.<br />\r\nThis document applies to battery swap systems for removable
    RESS/EV where the removable RESS/EV is stored for the purpose of transfer power
    between the battery swap station and removable RESS/EV.<br />\r\nRequirements
    for bidirectional energy transfer DC to AC are under consideration and are not
    part of this document.<br />\r\nThis document applies to:<br />\r\n– battery swap
    systems supplied from on-site storage systems (for example buffer batteries etc;<br
    />\r\n– manual, mechanically assisted and automatic systems);<br />\r\n– battery
    swap systems intended to supply removable battery systems having communication
    allowing to identify the battery system characteristics;<br />\r\n– battery swap
    systems intended to be installed at an altitude of up to 2 000 m.<br />\r\nThe
    aspects covered in this document include:<br />\r\n– requirements for power transfer
    between the battery systems;<br />\r\n– additional requirements for communication;<br
    />\r\n– the connection to supply network.<br />\r\nAdditional requirements may
    apply to special locations.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to:<br />\r\n–
    safety requirements for mechanical equipment covered by ISO 10218 (all parts);<br
    />\r\n– locking compartments systems providing AC socket-outlets for the use of
    manufacturer specific voltage converter units and manufacturer specific battery
    systems;<br />\r\n– safety aspects related to maintenance;<br />\r\n– electrical
    devices and components which are covered by their specific product standards;<br
    />\r\n– trolley buses, rail vehicles;<br />\r\n– any on-board equipment which
    is covered by ISO;<br />\r\n– EMC requirements for on-board equipment while connected
    to the supply, which are covered by IEC 61851-21-1.<br />\r\nRequirements for
    battery swap systems using protective measures as covered by 410 of IEC 60364-4-41:2005
    other than double or reinforced insulation are under consideration."
