  content: "IEC 61010-2-034:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 61010-2-034:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 61010-1:2010 and IEC 61010-1:2010/AMD1:2016.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC
    61010-2-034:2023 specifies safety requirements to equipment for measuring insulation
    resistance and to equipment for testing electric strength which have an output
    voltage exceeding 50 V a.c. or 120 V d.c. This document also applies to combined
    measuring equipment which has an insulation resistance measurement function or
    an electric strength test measurement function. This document has the status of
    a horizontal publication in accordance with IEC Guide 108. It has the status of
    a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) in 1.2.1, requirements
    for protection against hazards which could occur from reading a voltage have been
    added to the scope;<br />\r\nb) Clause 2, all normative references have been dated;
    new normative references have been added;<br />\r\nc) in 4.3.2.5, requirements
    for power supply have been modified;<br />\r\nd) in 4.3.2.6, requirements for
    inputs/outputs have been modified;<br />\r\ne) in 5.1.5.101.2, minimum ratings
    for voltage of measuring terminals are required;<br />\r\nf) in 5.4.2, new ratings
    for documentation have been added;<br />\r\ng) in 5.4.4, new instructions for
    operation have been added;<br />\r\nh) in 5.101.1, hazard indicators shall be
    functional in normal condition and in single fault condition;<br />\r\ni) in 6.6.101.1,
    insulating material of group I may be allowed for determination of creepage distances
    of measuring circuit terminals;<br />\r\nj) in 6.6.101.2, Clearances and creepage
    distances above 1 000 V a.c. and 1 500 V d.c. for measuring circuit terminals
    in unmated position have been defined;<br />\r\nk) in 6.6.101.3, requirements
    for measuring circuit terminals in partially mated position have been specified;<br
    />\r\nl) in 6.6.101.4, requirements for measuring circuit terminals in mated position
    have been specified;<br />\r\nm) Subclause 6.102 replaces 6.9.103 and has been
    rephrased;<br />\r\nn) new Subclause 9.101 to consider the protection of measuring
    circuits against the spread of fire and arc flash has been added. Table 102 has
    been replaced by Table K.101;<br />\r\no) In 9.101.2, relocation of 101.3 of previous
    edition;<br />\r\np) In 9.101.3, relocation of 101.4 of previous edition, extension
    to measurement category II and reference to IEC 61000-4-5 for tests;<br />\r\nq)
    in 9.101.4, requirements for measuring circuit terminals in mated position have
    been specified;<br />\r\nr) in 9.101.5, relocation of K.103 of previous edition
    with numerous technical changes;<br />\r\ns) in 14.101, relocation of 14.102.
    14.101 of previous edition has been removed;<br />\r\nt) in 101.3, relocation
    of 101.5 of previous edition, and more requirements added against hazard occurring
    from reading a voltage value;<br />\r\nu) in K.2.1, another method for determination
    of clearances of secondary circuits is proposed;<br />\r\nv) in K.3.2, new Table
    K.15 and Table K.16 for clearance calculation;<br />\r\nw) in K.3.101, relocation
    of 6.9.104 of previous edition;<br />\r\nx) in K.101.4.1, new Table K.103 and
    Table K.104 replace Table K.102, Table K.103 and Table K.104;<br />\r\ny) in K.101.4,
    the subclause has been reviewed. Tables and tests for solid insulation have been
    modified. Table K.105 replaces Table K.9;<br />\r\nz) Table K.101, replacement
    of Table K.106;<br />\r\naa) Clause K.4, redraft of the clause to propose a method
    for determination of Ut for circuits which reduce transient overvoltages;<br />\r\nbb)
    Annex EE: addition of a new informative annex for determination of clearances
    for Table 101."
