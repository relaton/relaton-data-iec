abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62726:2014 describes principles and guidance on quantifying greenhouse
    gas emission (CO2e) reductions compared to a baseline (which includes "business
    as usual") for electrical and electronic products and systems (hereinafter referred
    as EE products). It is based on the result of a comparative study on existing
    methodologies published or under discussion in international organizations.
