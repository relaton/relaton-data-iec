abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62726:2014 describes principles and guidance on quantifying greenhouse
    gas emission (CO<sub>2</sub>e) reductions compared to a baseline (which includes
    "business as usual") for electrical and electronic products and systems (hereinafter
    referred as EE products). It is based on the result of a comparative study on
    existing methodologies published or under discussion in international organizations.
