abstract:
- content: "IEC 60684-3-283:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60684-3-283:2019
    gives the requirements for two types of heat-shrinkable, polyolefin sleeving for
    bus-bar insulation, with a nominal shrink ratio of 2,5:1. This sleeving has been
    found suitable up to temperatures of 100 °C.<br />\r\nType A: Medium wall - internal
    diameter up to 170,0 mm typically<br />\r\nType B: Thick wall - internal diameter
    up to 165,0 mm typically<br />\r\nThese sleevings are normally supplied in colour,
    red or brown. Since these types of sleeving cover a significantly large range
    of sizes and wall thicknesses, Annex A (Tables A.1 and A.2) provides guidance
    to the range of sizes available. The actual size and wall thickness will be agreed
    between the user and supplier depending on the electric strength of the installed
    tubing offered and the requirements of the user. Materials which conform to this
    specification meet established levels of performance. However, the selection of
    a material by a user for a specific application will be based on the actual requirements
    necessary for adequate performance in that application and not based on this specification
    alone. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2010 and Amendment 1:2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- change of moulded plaque thickness for resistance
    to tracking and weathering tests to (6 ± 0,5) mm.<br />\r\nKeywords: Heat-shrinkable,
    polyolefin sleeving for bus-bar insulation"
