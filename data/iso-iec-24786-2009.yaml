    <p>People with disabilities (e.g. visual, hearing, physical) can experience difficulties in accessing computers and other information/communication technology (ICT) devices. Accessible user interfaces, as defined in ISO/IEC 24786:2009, can help them to operate computers if they are able to adjust accessibility settings prior to use. If this is not possible, some people will not be able to access these devices without help from another party. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24786:2009 specifies requirements and recommendations for making accessibility settings accessible. This will make the information technologies more accessible by ensuring that people with disabilities can adjust accessibility settings by themselves. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24786:2009 provides guidance on specific accessibility settings. It specifies how to access and operate the accessibility setting mode, and how to directly activate specific accessibility functions. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24786:2009 applies to all operating system user interfaces on computers, but can also be applied to other types of ICT, where appropriate. It does not apply to the user interface before the operating system is loaded and active.</p>
