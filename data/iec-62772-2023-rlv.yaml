  content: "IEC 62772:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62772:2023
    applies to composite hollow core station post insulators consisting of a load-bearing
    insulating tube (core) made of resin impregnated fibres, insulating filler material
    (solid, liquid, gaseous – pressurized or unpressurized), a housing (outside the
    insulating tube) made of polymeric material (for example silicone or ethylene-propylene)
    and fixing devices at the ends of the insulating tube. Composite hollow core station
    post insulators as defined in this standard are intended for general use in substations
    in both, outdoor and indoor environments, operating with a rated AC voltage greater
    than 1 000 V and a frequency not greater than 100 Hz or for use in direct current
    systems with a rated voltage greater than 1 500 V DC. The object of this document
    is:<br />\r\n- to define the terms used;<br />\r\n- to specify test methods;<br
    />\r\n- to specify acceptance criteria."
