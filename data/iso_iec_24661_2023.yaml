abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace:
    none;">This document specifies user interfaces (UIs) designed for full duplex
    (FDX) speech interaction. It also specifies the FDX speech interaction model,
    features, functional components and requirements, thus providing a framework to
    support natural conversational interfaces between humans and machines. It also
    provides privacy considerations for applying FDX speech interaction.</p><p class="MsoBodyText"
    style="mso-layout-grid-align: none; text-autospace: none;">This document is applicable
    to UIs for speech interaction and communication protocols for setting up a session-oriented
    FDX interaction between humans and machines.</p><p class="MsoBodyText" style="mso-layout-grid-align:
    none; text-autospace: none;">This document does not define the speech interaction
    engines themselves or specify the details of specific engines, devices and approaches.</p>'
