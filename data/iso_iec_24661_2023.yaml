abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24661:2023 This document specifies user interfaces (UIs) designed
    for full duplex (FDX) speech interaction. It also specifies the FDX speech interaction
    model, features, functional components and requirements, thus providing a framework
    to support natural conversational interfaces between humans and machines. It also
    provides privacy considerations for applying FDX speech interaction.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to UIs for speech interaction and communication protocols
    for setting up a session-oriented FDX interaction between humans and machines.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not define the speech interaction engines themselves
    or specify the details of specific engines, devices and approaches."
