  content: Provides guidance to those involved in the design of avionic systems and
    equipment. Builds on the initial guidance on the system level approach to Single
    Event Effects in IEC/TS 62396-1, considers some avionic systems and provides basic
    methods to accommodate SEE so that system hardware assurance levels may be met.
