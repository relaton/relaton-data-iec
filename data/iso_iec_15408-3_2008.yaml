abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15408-3:2008 defines the assurance requirements of the evaluation
    criteria. It includes the evaluation assurance levels that define a scale for
    measuring assurance for component targets of evaluation (TOEs), the composed assurance
    packages that define a scale for measuring assurance for composed TOEs, the individual
    assurance components from which the assurance levels and packages are composed,
    and the criteria for evaluation of protection profiles and security targets.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15408-3:2008 defines the content and presentation of the assurance
    requirements in the form of assurance classes, families and components and provides
    guidance on the organization of new assurance requirements. The assurance components
    within the assurance families are presented in a hierarchical order."
