abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63528:2025 specifies descriptors for classifying and grouping the
    diverse and wide range of haptics events and functions in multimedia systems,
    which are already used in consumer electronics, computer interfaces, automobiles,
    amusements, and communications.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document is to define
    descriptors for classifying various types of haptics systems from different perspectives.
    This will enable the consideration of standardization items such as compatibility,
    interoperability, performance, and evaluation and measurement methods for the
    classified haptics systems."
