abstract:
- content: "IEC PAS 61851-1-1:2023 applies to a new type of AC EV supply equipment
    for charging electric road vehicles, with a rated supply voltage up to 1 000 V
    AC and a rated output voltage up to 1 000 V AC.<br />\r\nThis document provides
    specific requirements for AC charging system using type 4 vehicle coupler.<br
    />\r\nType 4 vehicle coupler is under consideration by SC23H.<br />\r\nVehicle
    inlet and vehicle connector of type 4 are intended to be used for charging in
    modes 2 and 3, case C.<br />\r\nThis document is to be read in conjunction with
