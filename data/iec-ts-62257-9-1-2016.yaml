  content: "IEC TS 62257-9-1:2016(E) provides general requirements for the design,
    erection and operation of micropower plants and general requirements to ensure
    the safety of persons and property. The micropower plants covered by this specification
    are low-voltage a.c., three-phase or single-phase, with rated capacity less than,
    or equal to, 100 kVA. The main technical changes with regard to the previous edition
    are as follows: changing the voltage range covered by the technical specification
    to AC nominal voltage below 1 000 V and DC nominal voltage below 1 500 V.<br />\r\n<br
