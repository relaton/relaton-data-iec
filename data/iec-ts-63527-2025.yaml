  content: "IEC TS 63527:2025 is applicable to the safe management and operation of
    and work activity on, with, or near electrical installations operating at voltage
    levels from and including extra-low voltage up to and including high voltage.<br
    />\r\nThis latter term includes those levels commonly referred to as medium and
    extra-high voltage.<br />\r\nThese electrical installations are designed for the
    generation, transmission, conversion, distribution and use of electrical power.
    Some of these electrical installations are permanent and fixed, such as a distribution
    installation in a factory or office complex, others are temporary, such as on
    construction sites, and others are mobile or capable of being moved either whilst
    energized or whilst not energized nor charged. Examples are electrically driven
    excavating machines in quarries or open-cast coal sites.<br />\r\nThis document
    sets out the requirements for the safe management and operation of and work activity
    on, with, or near these electrical installations. The requirements apply to all
    operational, working and maintenance procedures. They apply to all non-electrical
    work such as building work near to overhead lines or underground cables as well
    as electrical work , when there is a risk of electrical danger.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not apply to ordinary persons when using installations and equipment,
    provided that the installations and equipment comply with relevant standards and
    are designed and installed for use by ordinary persons.<br />\r\nThis document
    has not been developed specifically to apply to the electrical installations listed
    below. However, if there are no other rules or procedures, the principles of this
    document could be applied to them:<br />\r\n– on any aircraft and hovercraft moving
    under its own power, (international aviation laws can apply);<br />\r\n– on any
    sea going ship moving under its own power, or under the direction of the master,
    (international marine laws can apply);<br />\r\n– electronic telecommunications
    and information systems;<br />\r\n– electronic instrumentation, control and automation
    systems;<br />\r\n– at coal or other mines;<br />\r\n– on off-shore installations
    (international marine laws can apply);<br />\r\n– on vehicles;<br />\r\n– on electric
    traction systems;<br />\r\n–on experimental electrical research work."
