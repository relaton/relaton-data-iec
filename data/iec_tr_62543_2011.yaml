abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62543:2011(E) gives general guidance on the subject of voltage-sourced
    converters used for transmission of power by high voltage direct current (HVDC).
    It describes converters that are not only voltage-sourced (containing a capacitive
    energy storage medium and where the polarity of d.c. voltage remains fixed) but
    also self-commutated, using semiconductor devices which can both be turned on
    and turned off by control action. The scope includes 2-level and 3-level converters
    with pulse-width modulation (PWM), along with multi-level converters, but excludes
    2-level and 3-level converters operated without PWM, in square-wave output mode.
    HVDC power transmission using voltage sourced converters is known as &quot;VSC
    transmission&quot;. The various types of circuit that can be used for VSC transmission
    are described in the report, along with their principal operational characteristics
    and typical applications. The overall aim is to provide a guide for purchasers
    to assist with the task of specifying a VSC transmission scheme. Line-commutated
    and current-sourced converters are specifically excluded from this report. This
    technical report cancels and replaces IEC/PAS 62543:2008 (Ed.1) which was published
    by IEC and CIGRÃ‰ jointly, and combined with engineering experience.
