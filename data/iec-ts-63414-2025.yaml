  content: "IEC TS 63414:2025 is applicable for the determination of the AC and DC
    pollution flashover and withstand voltage characteristics of insulators with polymeric
    housing, to be used outdoors in HV applications and exposed to polluted environments.
    This is also applicable for insulators with hydrophobic coatings. This document
    refers to AC systems with a rated voltage greater than 1 000 V and DC systems
    with a rated voltage greater than 1 500 V.<br />\r\nThe object of this technical
    specification is to prescribe standardized test methods, requirements and procedures
    for artificial pollution tests applicable to polymeric insulators for overhead
    lines including traction lines, station post and hollow insulators of equipment.
    Available test experience with polymeric station post and hollow insulators, especially
    for DC applications, is limited.<br />\r\nThe proposed tests are not applicable
    to ceramic and glass insulators without polymeric housing, to greased insulators
    or to special types of insulators (e.g., insulators with semiconducting glaze).<br
    />\r\nDifferently to ceramic and glass insulators without polymeric housing:<br
    />\r\n- The pollution performance of insulators with polymeric housing varies
    with the hydrophobicity condition of the surface. The specific conditions simulated
    by standardized tests might not represent the actual dynamic field conditions.<br
    />\r\n- The determination of the flashover and/or withstand voltage under pollution
    conditions is not enough for dimensioning. Additional constraints related to possible
    ageing are also to be considered.<br />\r\n- If the Hydrophobicity Transfer Material
    (HTM) test according to IEC TR 62039 confirms that an insulator is non-HTM, it
    can be tested according to IEC 60507 or IEC TS 61245."
