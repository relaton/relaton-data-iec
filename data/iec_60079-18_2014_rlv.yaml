abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-18:2014 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60079-18:2014
    gives the specific requirements for the construction, testing and marking of electrical
    equipment, parts of electrical equipment and Ex components with the type of protection
    encapsulation \"m\" intended for use in explosive gas atmospheres or explosive
    dust atmospheres. This part applies only for encapsulated electrical equipment,
    encapsulated parts of electrical equipment and encapsulated Ex components (hereinafter
    always referred to as \"m\" equipment) where the rated voltage does not exceed
    11 kV. The application of electrical equipment in atmospheres, which may contain
    explosive gas as well as combustible dust simultaneously, may require additional
    protective measures. This standard does not apply to dusts of explosives, which
    do not require atmospheric oxygen for combustion, or to pyrophoric substances.
    This standard does not take account of any risk due to an emission of flammable
    or toxic gas from the dust. This standard supplements and modifies the general
    requirements of IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement of this standard conflicts with
    a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the requirement of this standard takes precedence.
    This International Standard is to be used in conjunction with IEC 60079-0, Explosive
    atmospheres - Part 0: Equipment-General requirements. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition of IEC 60079-18:2009, and constitutes a technical
    revision. Please refer to the foreword of the document for a listing of the technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition.<br />\r\nKeywords: encapsulation
    \"m\", explosive gas atmospheres, explosive dust atmospheres<br />\r\nThe contents
    of the corrigendum of July 2018 have been included in this copy."
