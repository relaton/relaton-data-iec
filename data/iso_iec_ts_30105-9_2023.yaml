abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 30105-9:2023 This document specifies the essentials of digital
    transformations and illustrates the key drivers for enhancing the digital transformation
    capabilities of the organization, while taking account of different stakeholdersâ€™
    interests. It describes elements that ITES-BPO organizations can include specifically
    for digital transformation when implementing the lifecycle processes in the ISO/IEC
    30105 series, and which can assist the organization in achieving their desired
    process capability levels, hereafter \"maturity levels\", as defined by the stakeholders.
    It provides guidance on process capability assessment for digital transformation
    for ITES-BPO organizations. Additionally, this document:<br />\r\n- covers IT
    enabled business processes that are outsourced;<br />\r\n- is not intended to
    address the maturity and capability of the IT processes that support ITES-BPO,
    but identifies the IT capabilities needed to support the achievement of specific
    ITES-BPO capabilities;<br />\r\n- is applicable to the service provider, not to
    the customer;<br />\r\n- is applicable to all lifecycle processes of ITES-BPO;<br
    />\r\n- provides guidelines to supplement the ISO/IEC 30105-2 process assessment
    model, enabling assessment of process capability of ITES-BPO organizations undergoing
    digital transformation."
