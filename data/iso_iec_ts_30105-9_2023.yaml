    none;">This document specifies the essentials of digital transformations and illustrates
    the key drivers for enhancing the digital transformation capabilities of the organization,
    while taking account of different stakeholders’ interests. It describes elements
    that ITES-BPO organizations can include specifically for digital transformation
    when implementing the lifecycle processes in the ISO/IEC 30105 series, and which
    can assist the organization in achieving their desired process capability levels,
    hereafter "maturity levels", as defined by the stakeholders. It provides guidance
    on process capability assessment for digital transformation for ITES-BPO organizations.
    Additionally, this document:</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="tab-stops: 19.85pt
