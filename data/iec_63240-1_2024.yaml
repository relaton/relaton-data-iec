abstract:
- content: "IEC 63240-1:2024 specifies the AAL reference architecture. This document
    defines concepts and introduces terminology. It provides generic rules for designers
    of AAL systems and services with the aim to facilitate systems design and enable
    interoperability between components. This document identifies safety, security,
    privacy, and other requirements for AAL systems such as usability, accessibility,
    and trustworthiness (reliability, resilience) and sets up a process to identify
    the needs on the body area network (BAN), edge and cloud computing in the architecture
    perspective.<br />\r\nIEC 63240-1:2024 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) clarifying the Introduction;<br />\r\nb) new terms
    and definitions have been added in 3.1;<br />\r\nc) adaption of terms according
    to the IEV in the whole document;<br />\r\nd) reference to ethical considerations
    of AI when applied in the AAL context has been added in Clause 5;<br />\r\ne)
    clarifying the description of AAL reference architecture in 6.3.1;<br />\r\nf)
    process to identify the needs on BAN, edge and cloud computing in the architecture
    perspective has been added in 6.3.2 and 6.3.3;<br />\r\ng) new figures have been
    added in 6.3.2 and 6.3.3;<br />\r\nh) reference to standards inventory has been
