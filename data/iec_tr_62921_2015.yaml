abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62921:2015(E) outlines detailed guidance to streamline the quantification
    of greenhouse gas emissions for computers and monitors. It provides specific guidance
    for the use of streamlining techniques that minimize cost and resources needed
    to complete greenhouse gas emissions quantifications. In addition, the product
    category rules (PCR) section of this Technical Report recommends "state-of-the-art"
    process and data assumptions in order to reduce uncertainty. Lastly, this Technical
    Report provides an example of how a calculation could be performed.
