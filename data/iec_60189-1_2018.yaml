abstract:
- content: "IEC 60189-1:2018 specifies mechanical, electrical and climatic test methods
    for low-frequency cables and wires designed for use in telecommunication inside
    plants and equipment and in electronic devices employing similar techniques. This
    fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2007. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Test methods for dielectric strength and insulation resistance that were referenced
    in the previous edition have been withdrawn. They have been replaced with references
    to similar test methods described in current standards.<br />\r\nb) References
    to the IEC 60811 series have been updated as the numbering of this series has
    completely been changed."
