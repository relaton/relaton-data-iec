abstract:
- content: "IEC 61158-4-2:2023 is one of a series produced to facilitate the interconnection
    of automation system components. It is related to other standards in the set as
    defined by the \"three-layer\" fieldbus reference model described in IEC 61158â€‘1.<br
    />\r\nThe data-link protocol provides the data-link service by making use of the
    services available from the physical layer. The primary aim of this document is
    to provide a set of rules for communication expressed in terms of the procedures
    to be carried out by peer data-link entities (DLEs) at the time of communication.
    These rules for communication are intended to provide a sound basis for development
    in order to serve a variety of purposes:<br />\r\n- as a guide for implementers
    and designers;<br />\r\n- for use in the testing and procurement of equipment;<br
    />\r\n- as part of an agreement for the admittance of systems into the open systems
    environment;<br />\r\n- as a refinement to the understanding of time-critical
    communications within OSI."
