abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62343-6-3:2010(E) describes the round robin measurement results
    for the group delay ripple (GDR) of tunable dispersion compensators (TDCs). It
    briefly explains the four typical TDCs measured and four typical methods of measuring
    group delay (GD), as well as the GDR round robin measurement results of TDCs,
    and an analysis of repeatability and differences among these measurement methods.
