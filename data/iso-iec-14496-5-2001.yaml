    <p>Reference software is normative in the sense that any conforming implementation of the software, taking the same</p>
    <p>conformant bitstreams, using the same output file format, will output the same file. Complying ISO/IEC 14496</p>
    <p>implementations are not expected to follow the algorithms or the programming techniques used by the reference</p>
    <p>software. Although the decoding software is considered normative, it cannot add anything to the textual technical</p>
    <p>description included in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of ISO/IEC 14496.</p>
    <p>The software contained in this part of ISO/IEC 14496 is divided into three categories:</p>
    <p>a) <b>Elementary stream decoding software </b>is catalogued in clauses 3, 4 and 5. This software accepts</p>
    <p>elementary streams encoded according to the normative specification in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of ISO/IEC 14496</p>
    <p>and decodes the streams into the media types associated with each elementary stream. While this software</p>
    <p>appears in the normative part of this specification, attention is drawn to the fact that the implementation</p>
    <p>techniques used in this software are not considered normative ? several different implementations could</p>
    <p>produce the same result ? but the software is considered normative in that it correctly implements the decoding</p>
    <p>processes described in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of ISO/IEC 14496.</p>
    <p>b) <b>Elementary stream encoding software </b>is catalogued in Annex A (informative). This software creates</p>
    <p>elementary streams from associated media types. The encoders are provided as a means to obtain</p>
    <p>elementary streams with the normative syntax described in parts 1, 2 and 3 of ISO/IEC 14496. The techniques</p>
    <p>used for encoding are not specified by this specification, and the quality and complexity of these encoders has</p>
    <p>not been optimized.</p>
    <p>c) <b>Utility software </b>is catalogued in Annex B (informative). This software was found useful by the developers of</p>
    <p>the standard, but may not conform to the normative specifications given in parts 1, 2, 3 and 6 of</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 14496.</p>
    <p>File locations given in this part of ISO/IEC 14496 are expressed relative to its location in the source tree.</p>
