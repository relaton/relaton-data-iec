abstract:
- content: <p>This part of ISO/IEC 14478 defines a standard set of multimedia system
    services that can be used by multimedia application de足velopers in a variety of
    computing environments. The focus is on enabling multimedia applications in a
    heterogeneous, distrib足uted computing environment. Throughout this part of ISO/IEC
    14478, this component will also be referred to as "Multimedia Systems Services",
    and abbreviated as MSS.</p><p>The Multimedia Systems Services constitutes a framework
    of "middleware" - system software components lying in the region between the generic
    operating system and specific applications. As middleware, the Multimedia Systems
    Services marshals low足er-level system resources to the task of supporting multimedia
    processing, providing a set of common services which can be used by multimedia
    application developers.</p><p>The Multimedia Systems Services encompasses the
    following characteristics:</p><p>a) provision of an abstract type for a media
    processing node, extensible through subtyping to support abstractions of real
    media processing hardware or software;</p><p>b) provision of an abstract type
    for the data flow path or the connection between media processing nodes, encapsulating
    low-level connection and transport semantics;</p><p>c) grouping of multiple processing
    nodes and connections into a single unit for purposes of resource reservation
    and stream control;</p><p>d) provision or a media dataflow abstraction. with support
    for a variety of position, time and/or synchronization capabili足ties;</p><p>e)
    separation of the media format abstractions from the dataflow abstraction;</p><p>f)
    synchronous exceptions and asynchronous events;</p><p>g) application visible characterization
    of object capabilities;</p><p>h) registration of objects in a distributed environment
    by location and capabilities;</p><p>i) retrieval of objects in a distributed environment
    by location and constraints;</p><p>j) definition of a Media Stream Protocol to
    support media independent transport and synchronization.</p><p>The Multimedia
    Systems Services rely on the object model of ISO/IEC 14478-1 (Fundamentals of
    PREMO) and the object types and non-object data types defined in TSO/IEC 14478-2
    (PREMO Foundation Component).</p>
