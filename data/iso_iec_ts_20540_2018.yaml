abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 20540:2018 This document provides recommendations and checklists
    which can be used to support the specification and operational testing of cryptographic
    modules in their operational environment within an organization's security system.<br
    />\r\nThe cryptographic modules have four security levels which ISO/IEC 19790
    defines to provide for a wide spectrum of data sensitivity (e.g. low-value administrative
    data, million-dollar funds transfers, life-protecting data, personal identity
    information, and sensitive information used by government) and a diversity of
    application environments (e.g. a guarded facility, an office, removable media,
    and a completely unprotected location).<br />\r\nThis document includes:<br />\r\na)
    recommendations to perform secure assessing for cryptographic module installation,
    configuration and operation;<br />\r\nb) recommendations to inspecting the key
    management system, protection of authentication credentials, and public and critical
    security parameters in the operational environment;<br />\r\nc) recommendations
    for identifying cryptographic module vulnerabilities;<br />\r\nd) checklists for
    the cryptographic algorithm policy, security guidance and regulation, security
    manage requirements, security level for each of the 11 requirement areas, the
    strength of the security function, etc.; and<br />\r\ne) recommendations to determine
    that the cryptographic module's deployment satisfies the security requirements
    of the organization.<br />\r\nThis document assumes that the cryptographic module
    has been validated as conformant with ISO/IEC 19790.<br />\r\nIt can be used by
    an operational tester along with other recommendations if needed.<br />\r\nThis
    document is limited to the security related to the cryptographic module. It does
    not include assessing the security of the operational or application environment.
    It does not define techniques for the identification, assessment and acceptance
    of the organization's operational risk.<br />\r\nThe organization's accreditation,
    deployment and operation processes, shown in Figure 1, is not included to the
    scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document addresses operational testers who
    perform the operational testing for the cryptographic modules in their operational
    environment authorizing officials of cryptographic modules."
