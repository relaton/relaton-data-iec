abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides recommendations and checklists which can be
    used to support the specification and operational testing of cryptographic modules
    in their operational environment within an organization's security system.</p><p>The
    cryptographic modules have four security levels which ISO/IEC 19790 defines to
    provide for a wide spectrum of data sensitivity (e.g. low-value administrative
    data, million-dollar funds transfers, life-protecting data, personal identity
    information, and sensitive information used by government) and a diversity of
    application environments (e.g. a guarded facility, an office, removable media,
    and a completely unprotected location).</p><p>This document includes:</p><p>a)
    recommendations to perform secure assessing for cryptographic module installation,
    configuration and operation;</p><p>b) recommendations to inspecting the key management
    system, protection of authentication credentials, and public and critical security
    parameters in the operational environment;</p><p>c) recommendations for identifying
    cryptographic module vulnerabilities;</p><p>d) checklists for the cryptographic
    algorithm policy, security guidance and regulation, security manage requirements,
    security level for each of the 11 requirement areas, the strength of the security
    function, etc.; and</p><p>e) recommendations to determine that the cryptographic
    module's deployment satisfies the security requirements of the organization.</p><p>This
    document assumes that the cryptographic module has been validated as conformant
    with ISO/IEC 19790.</p><p>It can be used by an operational tester along with other
    recommendations if needed.</p><p>This document is limited to the security related
    to the cryptographic module. It does not include assessing the security of the
    operational or application environment. It does not define techniques for the
    identification, assessment and acceptance of the organization's operational risk.</p><p>The
    organization's accreditation, deployment and operation processes, shown in Figure
    1, is not included to the scope of this document.</p><p>This document addresses
    operational testers who perform the operational testing for the cryptographic
    modules in their operational environment authorizing officials of cryptographic
    modules.</p>"
