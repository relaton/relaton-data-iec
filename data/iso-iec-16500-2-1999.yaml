    <p>The purpose of this part of ISO/IEC 16500 is to specify normative protocols and associated dynamic system</p>
    <p>behavior, including session and connection manipulation, configuration and download, for an ISO/IEC 16500</p>
    <p>system. The emphasis is on the significant dynamic system entities (e.g., session control, call/connection</p>
    <p>control), the behavior of these entities (e.g., information flows, entity actions, parameters passed) and the</p>
    <p>allowable physical placement(s) of these entities in a DAVIC system (i.e., physical instances). As such, this</p>
    <p>part of ISO/IEC 16500 complements the static systems reference model described in ISO/IEC 16500-1,</p>
    <p>specifying normative dynamic behavior as well as specifying the protocol(s) required to realize this behavior.</p>
    <p>The protocols themselves are specified primarily through the use of "Protocol Network Architecture"</p>
    <p>diagrams which visually illustrate, for each of the defined physical instances and application scenarios, the</p>
    <p>various protocol stacks which are to be used. Detailed specification of the individual protocol tools</p>
    <p>themselves (e.g., the detailed protocol messages used to realize the DAVIC dynamic flow behavior) is</p>
    <p>provided in ISO/IEC 16500-5 (mid- and higher layers) and ISO/IEC 16500-4 (lower layers) of this</p>
    <p>specification.</p>
    <p>This results in instance specifications made up of building blocks from the DAVIC tool set organized in a</p>
    <p>manner describing a system which performs DAVIC functions.</p>
