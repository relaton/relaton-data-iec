  content: "IEC 60704-2-7:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 60704-2-7:2020 applies
    to electrical fans (including their accessories and their component parts) for
    household and similar use, designed for AC or DC supply. The motor, the impeller
    and their housing, if any, form a single unit. These particular requirements apply
    to:<br />\r\n– conventional fans,<br />\r\n– table fans,<br />\r\n– pedestal fans,<br
    />\r\n– ceiling fans,<br />\r\n– bladeless fans,<br />\r\n– wall bracket fans,<br
    />\r\n– ceiling bracket fans,<br />\r\n– louver fans,<br />\r\n– tower fans,<br
    />\r\n– ventilating and partition ventilating fans.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to:<br />\r\n– fans that are part of a ventilation system,<br />\r\n–
    fans designed exclusively for industrial purposes,<br />\r\n– fans that are part
    of an appliance (for example cooling fans),<br />\r\n– fans with additional functions
    (for example heating, humidifying).<br />\r\nLimitations for the use of this test
    code are given in the scope of IEC 60704-1.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 1997. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) it includes additional fan categories
    as defined in IEC 60879:2019 and IEC 60665:2018;<br />\r\nb) it includes standard
    deviations of sound power levels in 1.3;<br />\r\nc) a comparison method has been
    added;<br />\r\nd) the normative references have been updated (ISO 3744:2010 and
    ISO 3743-1:2010);<br />\r\ne) it has been adjusted with regard to IEC 60704-1:2010.<br
    />\r\nThis International Standard is to be used in conjunction with IEC 60704
    1:2010, Household and similar electrical appliances – Test code for the determination
    of airborne acoustical noise – Part 1: General requirements. This Part 2-7 supplements
    or modifies the corresponding clauses in IEC 60704-1:2010, so as to establish
    the test code for fans.</p>"
