  content: "IEC 61676:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61676:2023
    specifies the performance requirements of instruments as used in the non-invasive
    measurement of X-RAY tube voltage up to 150 kV and the relevant compliance tests.
    This document also describes the method for calibration and gives guidance for
    estimating the uncertainty in measurements performed under conditions different
    from those during calibration. Applications for such measurement are found in
    diagnostic radiology including mammography, computed tomography (CT), dental radiology
    and radioscopy. This document is not concerned with the safety aspect of such
    instruments. The requirements for electrical safety applying to them are contained
    in IEC 61010-1. IEC 61676:2023 cancels and replaces first edition published in
    2002, Amendment 1:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision. It includes
    an assessment of the combined standard uncertainty for the performance of a hypothetical
    instrument for the non-invasive measurement of the tube high voltage (in Annex
    A) which replaces Annex A of the edition 1.1 titled \"Recommended performance
    criteria for the invasive divider\".<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    of January 2024 have been included in this copy."
