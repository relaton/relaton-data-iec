abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 61836:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 61836:2016(E)
    deals with the terms, definitions and symbols from national and international
    solar photovoltaic standards and relevant documents used within the field of solar
    photovoltaic (PV) energy systems. It includes the terms, definitions and symbols
    compiled from the published IEC technical committee 82 standards. The main technical
    change with regard to the previous edition consists of adding / revising terms
    and definitions which have been discussed and agreed on during recent meetings
    of the TC 82 terminology working group."
