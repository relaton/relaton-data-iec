  content: "IEC 61936-1:2021 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61936-1:2021 CMV edition 3.0 and the previous IEC
    61936-1:2010+AMD1:2014 CSV edition 2.1. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 99 experts
    are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIEC 61936-1:2021 provides requirements for the design and the erection of
    electrical power installations in systems with nominal voltages exceeding 1 kV
    AC and nominal frequency up to and including 60 Hz, so as to provide safety and
    proper functioning for the use intended.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply
    to the design and erection of any of the following:<br />\r\n– overhead and underground
    lines between separate electrical power installations;<br />\r\n– electrified
    railway tracks and rolling stock;<br />\r\n– mining equipment and installations;<br
    />\r\n– fluorescent lamp installations;<br />\r\n– installations on ships according
    to IEC 60092 (all parts) and offshore units according to IEC 61892 (all parts),
    which are used in the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, processing and
    storage purposes;<br />\r\n– electrostatic equipment (e.g. electrostatic precipitators,
    spray-painting units);<br />\r\n– test sites;<br />\r\n– medical equipment, e.g.
    medical X-ray equipment.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to the design of
    prefabricated, type-tested switchgear and high voltage/low voltage prefabricated
    substation, for which separate IEC standards exist.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\nintroduction has been rewritten to reflect the status when this
    document is produced;<br />\r\nthe scope has been improved to clarify the application
    of this document;<br />\r\nmissing and obsolete terms and definitions have been
    updated including improvement of existing terms;<br />\r\nTable 1 has been updated
    where agreements between supplier and user are needed;<br />\r\nrequirements of
    electromagnetic compatibility have been clarified;<br />\r\ninsulation coordination
    clause (Clause 5) has improved wording for better clarity and the technical content
    has an updated coordination to the latest versions of the insulation coordination
    standards;<br />\r\nwording regarding electrical equipment has been improved and
    made clearer;<br />\r\nsubclause for fuses has been improved and reworded;<br
    />\r\nrequirements have been added for labelling when multiple sources are required
    to be disconnected;<br />\r\nmissing requirements for GIS have been reintroduced;<br
    />\r\nsubclause regarding ventilation (HVAC) has been improved;<br />\r\nfigures
    in Clause 7 have been updated and moved to the corresponding subclause;<br />\r\nrequirements
    for transformer installations have been improved including adjustment of editorial
    typing-errors;<br />\r\nclause on protection, automation and auxiliary systems
    has been restructured and improved;<br />\r\nprotection against lightning strokes
    has been extended;<br />\r\nclarification of content due to the distinction between
    erection (and providing electrical safety for the intended use of the electrical
    power installation) and subsequent activities such as maintenance and repair with
    safe working procedures;<br />\r\nwhere no provincial, national or regional regulations
    are available for safe working procedures, an informative guideline is provided
    in Annex F. This replaces the former parts of Figure 3 in Clause 7."
