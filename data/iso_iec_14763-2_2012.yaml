- content: |-
    ISO/IEC 14763-2:2012(E) specifies requirements for the planning, installation and operation of cabling and cabling infrastructures (including cabling, pathways, spaces, earthing and bonding) in support of generic cabling standards and associated documents. The following aspects are addressed:<br />
    - specification of the installation,<br />
    - quality assurance,<br />
    - installation planning,<br />
    - installation practice,<br />
    - documentation,<br />
    - administration,<br />
    - testing,<br />
    - inspection,<br />
    - operation,<br />
    - maintenance and repair. The requirements of Clauses 5 to 14 of this standard are premises-independent and may be amended by the requirements of premises-specific Annexes. This first edition supersedes Clauses 11 and 12 of ISO/IEC 11801, published in 2002, replaces ISO/IEC 14763-1, published in 1999, its Amendment 1 (2004), ISO/IEC TR 14763-2, published in 2000, ISO/IEC 18010, published in 2002, and its Amendment 1 (2005) and constitutes a technical revision. It includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: In addition to the supersession of parts of earlier standards and the incorporation of other standards, this standard provides much greater detail in all aspects of planning and installation with respect to ISO/IEC/TR 14763-2 and provides clearly differentiated and directed requirements and recommendations.
