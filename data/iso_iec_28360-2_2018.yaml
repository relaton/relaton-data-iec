abstract:
- content: <p>This Standard (all parts) specifies methods to determine chemical emission
    rates of analyte from ICT &amp; CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission
    Test Chamber (ETC).</p><p>This Standard (all parts) includes specific methods
    for equipment using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables,
    such as monitors and PC's.</p><p>Part 2 specifies the methods to determine chemical
    emission rates of analyte from electronic equipment not using consumables.</p><p>The
    methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in a controlled ETC, storage
    and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission rates.</p><p>Examples of EUT
    that do not use consumables are:</p><p>— Monitors and TV sets (CRT, Plasma, LCD,
    Rear projector, Beamer).</p><p>— Video (VCR, DVD Player/Recorder, Camcorder).</p><p>—
    SAT Receiver (Set-Top Box).</p><p>— Audio units (CD Player/Recorder, Home theatre
    Systems, Audio Home Systems, Micro-/Mini, Midi Systems, Amplifier, Receiver).</p><p>—
    Portable Audio (CD Player, MP 3 Player, Radio recorder, Clock radio, etc.).</p><p>—
    Computer (desktop, tower, server), portable computers (Notebooks).</p><p>The emission
    rates determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same
    class.</p><p>Predictions of "real indoor"<em>concentrations</em> from the determined<em>emission</em><em>rates</em>
    are outside the scope of this Standard.</p>
