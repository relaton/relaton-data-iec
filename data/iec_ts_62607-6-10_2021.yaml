abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-10:2021(E) establishes a standardized method to determine
    the electrical key control characteristic<br />\r\n– sheet resistance (Rs)<br
    />\r\nfor films of graphene-based materials by<br />\r\n– terahertz time domain
    spectroscopy (THz-TDS).<br />\r\nIn this technique, a THz pulse is sent to the
    graphene-based material. The transmitted or reflected THz waveform is measured
    in the time domain and transformed to the frequency domain by the fast Fourier
    transform (FFT). Finally, the spectrum is fitted to the Drude model (or another
    comparable model) to obtain the sheet resistance.<br />\r\n• This non-contact
    inspection method is non-destructive, fast and robust for the mapping of large
    areas of graphene films, with no upper sample size limit.<br />\r\n• The method
    is applicable for statistical process control, comparison of graphene films produced
    by different vendors, or to obtain information about imperfections on the microscale
    such as grain boundaries and defects, etc.<br />\r\n• The method is applicable
    for graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) or other methods on or
    transferred to dielectric substrates, including but not limited to quartz, silica
    (SiO2), silicon (Si), sapphire, silicon carbide (SiC) and polymers.<br />\r\n•
    The minimum spatial resolution is in the order of 300 µm (at 1 THz) given by the
    diffraction limited spot size of the THz pulse."
