    <p>Link Aggregation provides protocols, procedures, and managed objects that allow the following:</p>
    <p>- One or more parallel instances of full-duplex point-to-point links to be aggregated together to form a Link Aggregation Group (LAG), such that a MAC Client can treat the LAG as if it were a single link.</p>
    <p>- A resilient interconnect using multiple full-duplex point-to-point links among one to three nodes in a network and one to three nodes in another, separately administered, network, along with a means to ensure that frames belonging to any given service will use the same physical path in both directions between the two networks.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-1AX:2015 defines the MAC-independent Link Aggregation capability and general information relevant to specific MAC types that support Link Aggregation. The capabilities defined are compatible with previous versions of this standard.</p>
