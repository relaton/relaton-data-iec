  content: Fibre Channel provides a general data transport vehicle for Upper Level
    Protocols (ULPs) such as Intelligent Peripheral Interface (IPI) and Small Computer
    System Interface (SCSI) command sets, the High-Performance Parallel Interface
    (HIPPI) data framing, IP (Internet Protocol), ANSI&#x2F;IEEE 802.2, and others.
    This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 14165 describes a communication interface between a
    channel and I&#x2F;O control units that utilize the Single-Byte Command Code Sets
    (SBCCS) as implemented in a wide range of data processing systems. It employs
    information formats and signalling protocols that provide a uniform means for
    communicating with various types of I&#x2F;O control units, facilitating a high
    bandwidth, high performance and long distance information exchange environment.
    The protocol, abbreviated FC-SB-2, is intended for use with ANSI X3.230, FC-PH
    and its subsequent enhancements which specify the Fibre Channel Physical and Signalling
    Interface. FC-SB-2 is one of a number of Fibre Channel protocol mappings, referred
    to as FC-4s. The reader should be familiar with FC-PH, Single-Byte Command Code
    Sets Connection (SBCON) Architecture (ANSI X3.296-1997).
