abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-350:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60092-350:2020
    provides the general constructional requirements and test methods for use in the
    manufacture of electric power, control and instrumentation cables with copper
    conductors intended for fixed electrical systems at voltages up to and including
    18/30(36) kV on board ships and offshore (mobile and fixed) units.<br />\r\nThe
    reference to fixed systems includes those that are subjected to vibration (due
    to the movement of the ship or installation) or movement (due to motion of the
    ship or installation) and not to those that are intended for frequent flexing.
    Cables suitable for frequent or continual flexing use are detailed in other IEC
    standards, for example IEC 60227 (all parts) and IEC 60245 (all parts), and their
    uses are restricted to those situations which do not directly involve exposure
    to a marine environment, for example, portable tools and domestic appliances.<br
    />\r\nThe following types of cables are not included:<br />\r\n- optical fibre;<br
    />\r\n- sub-sea and umbilical cables;<br />\r\n- data and communication cables;<br
    />\r\n- coaxial cables.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2014 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) more detailed description of the test procedures in 7.7.6 and 7.7.7;<br
    />\r\nb) description of the relationship between Annex A and Annex D."
