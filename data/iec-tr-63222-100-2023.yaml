  content: IEC TR 63222-100:2023, which is a Technical Report, collects relevant information
    on power quality impacts from, e.g., CIGRE reports, case studies, research findings,
    etc., in order to uncover the mechanisms of how electrical equipment/installations/system
    are impacted by power quality disturbances, as well as to fully understand the
    guidelines for power quality management. The contents of this document aim to
    help network operators, network users and equipment suppliers make rational investments
    and actively cooperate to manage power quality and keep it consistent with relevant
    EMC standards.
