abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides a framework for developing quality measurement.</p><p>The
    contents of this document are as follows:</p><p>— quality measurement reference
    model;</p><p>— relationships among different types of quality measures;</p><p>—
    guidelines for selecting quality measures;</p><p>— guidelines for constructing
    quality measures;</p><p>— guidelines for planning and performing measurements;</p><p>—
    guidelines for the application of measurement results.</p><p>It includes considerations
    for selecting quality measures and quality measure elements (Annex A), assessing
    the reliability of measurement and the validity of quality measures (Annex B),
    elements for documenting quality measures (Annex C), normalized measurement function
    for quality measures (Annex D) and the measurement information model in ISO/IEC/IEEE
    15939 (Annex E).</p><p>This document can be applied for designing, identifying,
    evaluating and executing the measurement model of system and software product
    quality, quality in use, data quality and IT service quality. This reference model
    can be used by developers, acquirers, quality assurance staff and independent
    evaluators—essentially by people responsible for specifying and evaluating the
    quality of information and communication technology (ICT) systems and services.</p>"
