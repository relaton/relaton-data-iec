abstract:
- content: "This document provides a framework for developing quality measurement.<br
    />\r\nThe contents of this document are as follows:<br />\r\n- quality measurement
    reference model;<br />\r\n- relationships among different types of quality measures;<br
    />\r\n- guidelines for selecting quality measures;<br />\r\n- guidelines for constructing
    quality measures;<br />\r\n- guidelines for planning and performing measurements;<br
    />\r\n- guidelines for the application of measurement results.<br />\r\nIt includes
    considerations for selecting quality measures and quality measure elements (Annex
    A), assessing the reliability of measurement and the validity of quality measures
    (Annex B), elements for documenting quality measures (Annex C), normalized measurement
    function for quality measures (Annex D) and the measurement information model
    in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15939 (Annex E).<br />\r\nThis document can be applied for designing,
    identifying, evaluating and executing the measurement model of system and software
    product quality, quality in use, data quality and IT service quality. This reference
    model can be used by developers, acquirers, quality assurance staff and independent
    evaluatorsâ€”essentially by people responsible for specifying and evaluating the
    quality of information and communication technology (ICT) systems and services."
