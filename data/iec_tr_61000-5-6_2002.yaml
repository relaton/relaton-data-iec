abstract:
- content: This Technical Report covers guidelines for the mitigation of external
    electromagnetic influences impinging upon a facility, aimed at ensuring electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) among electrical and electronic apparatus or systems. These
    influences include lightning, RF transmitters, power-line and telecom transients,
    high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) and other high-power electromagnetic
    transients. More particularly, this technical report is concerned with the arrangement
    of shielding and screening against radiated disturbances, and with mitigation
    of conducted disturbances. These arrangements include appropriate electromagnetic
    barriers for industrial, commercial, and residential installations. Is intended
    for use by installers, manufacturers and users of sensitive electrical or electronic
    installations or systems, and of equipment with emission levels that could degrade
    the overall electromagnetic (EM) environment. It applies primarily to new installations
    but, where economically feasible, it may be applied to extensions or modifications
    to existing facilities.
