abstract:
- content: "<p>IEC 62217:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62217:2025 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 62217:2012
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 36 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62217:2025 is applicable to polymeric insulators for AC systems
    with a nominal voltage greater than 1 000 V (frequency less than 100 Hz) and DC
    systems with a nominal voltage greater than 1 500 V whose insulating body consists
    of one or various organic materials. Polymeric insulators covered by this document
    are intended for use both on HV overhead lines and in substations, in both indoor
    and outdoor applications. They include composite insulators with solid and hollow
    core and resin insulators. Hybrid insulators with ceramic core and polymeric housing
    are also included, while coated insulators (e.g. with RTV silicone rubber coatings)
    are not included in this standard. Electrical tests described in this document
    are done under AC voltage and are in general applicable to insulators to be used
    in DC systems too. Tests under DC voltage are intended to reflect up-to-date knowledge
    and experience. Only polymeric housing materials of hybrid insulators are specified
    in this document. Tests for core materials and the interfaces between housing
    and core of hybrid insulators are not included.<br />\r\nThe object of this document
    is<br />\r\n- to define the common terms used for polymeric insulators;<br />\r\n-
    to prescribe common test methods for design tests on polymeric insulators;<br
    />\r\n- to prescribe acceptance or failure criteria, if applicable;<br />\r\nThese
    tests, criteria and recommendations are intended to ensure a satisfactory lifetime
    under normal operating and environmental conditions. This document includes design
    tests intended to reject materials or designs which are inadequate under normal
    operating and environmental conditions. This document defines test methods and
    acceptance criteria. The applicable tests are given in the relevant product standard.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) The scope of the document is specified to comprise composite insulators
    with solid and hollow core and resin insulators used for both AC and DC systems
    in indoor and outdoor applications of HV overhead lines and substations; hybrid
    insulators (defined in IEC TS 62896) with ceramic core and polymeric housing are
    also included, while coated insulators (e.g. with Room Temperature Vulcanized
    (RTV) silicone rubber coatings) are not considered in this document;<br />\r\nb)
    Steep-front impulse voltage test is modified to avoid unwanted flashovers between
    the leads of the electrodes;<br />\r\nc) Differences between hydrophobicity transfer
    material (HTM) and non-HTM housing materials are specified and relevant test methods
    and acceptance criteria for polymeric insulators with HTM housing are introduced;<br
    />\r\nd) The previous water diffusion test on core materials with or without housing
    is split into two tests. One is on core materials without housing, the other is
    on core materials with housing. The acceptance criteria are modified;<br />\r\ne)
    Stress corrosion test for core materials is introduced;<br />\r\nf) Annex B summarizes
    the test application for evaluating the quality of interfaces and connections
    of end fittings, housing materials and core materials;<br />\r\ng) Annex E is
    introduced to emphasize the need for control of electric fields of polymeric insulators
    for AC. The control of electric fields of polymeric insulators for DC is still
    under consideration.</p>"
