abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23002-7:2022 This document specifies the syntax and semantics
    of video usability information (VUI) parameters and supplemental enhancement information
    (SEI) messages. The VUI parameters and SEI messages defined in this document are
    designed to be conveyed within coded video bitstreams in a manner specified in
    a video coding specification or to be conveyed by other means determined by the
    specifications for systems that make use of such coded video bitstreams. This
    document is particularly intended for use with coded video bitstreams as specified
    by Rec. ITUâ€‘T H.266 | ISO/IEC 23090-3, although it is drafted in a manner intended
    to be sufficiently generic that it can also be used with other types of coded
    video bitstreams.<br />\r\nVUI parameters and SEI messages can assist in processes
    related to decoding, display or other purposes. However, unless otherwise specified
    in a referencing specification, the interpretation and use of the VUI parameters
    and SEI messages specified in this document is not a required functionality of
    a video decoder or receiving video system. Although semantics are specified for
    the VUI parameters and SEI messages, decoders and receiving video systems can
    simply ignore the content of the VUI parameters and SEI messages or can use them
    in a manner that somewhat differs from what is specified in this document."
