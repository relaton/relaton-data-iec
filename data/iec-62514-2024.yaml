  content: "IEC 62514:2024 describes the general guidelines for typical applications
    of the home multimedia gateway in home networks supporting IP networking. This
    document specifies recommended functions and services to be supported by the home
    multimedia gateway and, where appropriate, refers to existing standards supported
    in the market. For general requirements, it is expected that widely adopted standards
    and technologies will be considered by implementers. This document gives supplementary
    applications to the IEC 62481 series, which specifies a central management model
    in home networks supporting various interfaces on the LAN side and on the WAN
    side (optional). This document is applicable to home multimedia gateways in the
    home network or networks of similar environments. IEC 62514:2024 cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of new multimedia processing functions
    and requirements the HMG shall support, including adaptive multimedia processing,
    audio/video remote processing, and play function enhancement, in Clause 6;<br
    />\r\nb) addition of home automation functions and requirements of audio/video
    analysis, recognition and alarm services based on AI technologies in Clause 7;<br
    />\r\nc) addition of upgrade function and requirements of HMG in Clause 12."
