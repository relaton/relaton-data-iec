abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-40:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-40:2022 edition 7.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-40:2018
    edition 6.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 61D experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-40:2022 deals with the safety of electric heat pumps,
    sanitary hot water heat pumps and air conditioners, incorporating motor-compressors
    as well as hydronic fan coils units, dehumidifiers (with or without motor-compressors),
    thermoelectric heat pumps and partial units. Their maximum rated voltage being
    not more than 300 V for single phase appliances and 600 V for multi-phase appliances.
    Appliances not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless can be
    a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen
    in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.
    The appliances referenced above can consist of one or more factory-made assemblies.
    If provided in more than one assembly, the separate assemblies are used together,
    and the requirements are based on the use of matched assemblies. This document
    does not take into account refrigerants other than group A1, A2L, A2 and A3 as
    defined by ISO 817. Flammable refrigerants are limited to those of a molar mass
    of more than or equal to 42 kg/kmol based on WCF (worst case formulation) as specified
    in ISO 817. As far as practical, this document deals with common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered in normal use and assumes that installation,
    servicing, decommissioning, and disposal are safely handled by competent persons
    and accidental release of refrigerants is avoided. However, it does not prescribe
    the criteria to ensure competence of persons during installation, servicing and
    disposal. Safety requirements during disposal are not specified in this standard.
    Supplementary heaters, or a provision for their separate installation, are within
    the scope of this standard, but only heaters which are designed as a part of the
    appliance package, the controls being incorporated in the appliance. Attention
    is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on-board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n-
    in many countries, additional requirements are specified, for example, by the
    national health authorities responsible for the protection of labour and the national
    authorities responsible for storage, transportation, building constructions and
    installations.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to<br />\r\n- humidifiers
    intended for use with heating and cooling equipment (IEC 60335-2-88);<br />\r\n-
    appliances designed exclusively for industrial processing;<br />\r\n- appliances
    intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the
    presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis
    seventh edition cancels and replaces the sixth edition published in 2018. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    Clause 1: added thermoelectric heat pumps to the scope and increased maximum rated
    voltage to 300 V for single phase appliances;<br />\r\n- Clause 7: revised requirements
    for marking on the appliance and packaging, including a symbol for minimum floor
    area and modifying the symbol for flammable refrigerants to include the safety
    group per ISO 817;<br />\r\n- Clause 11 and Clause 19: restructured for alignment
    with Part 1 and added requirements for supplementary air heaters;<br />\r\n- Clause
    13 and Clause 16: revised requirement for leakage current for stationary class
    I motor-operated appliances;<br />\r\n- Clause 21: added requirements for particle
    foam material and revised requirements for transport testing;<br />\r\n- Clause
    22: removed limit on the sum of refrigerant charges for appliances with multiple
    refrigerating systems, and revised requirements for avoiding ignition sources,
    leak detection systems, safety shut-off valves, and particle foam material;<br
    />\r\n- Clause 23: added requirements to avoid contact between wires and refrigerant
    piping;<br />\r\n- Clause 24"
