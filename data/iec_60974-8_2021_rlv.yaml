abstract:
- content: "IEC 60974-8:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60974-8:2021 specifies safety
    and performance requirements for gas consoles intended to be used with combustible
    gases or oxygen. These gas consoles are designed to supply gases for use in arc
    welding, plasma cutting, gouging and allied processes in non-explosive atmospheres.
    The gas console can be external or internal to the power source enclosure. In
    the latter case, the power source shall meet the requirements of both IEC 60974-1
    and this document. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition,
    published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. The significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition are the following:<br />\r\n-
    changes induced by the publication of IEC 60974-1:2017;<br />\r\n- requirements
    for the rating plate as in IEC 60974-1:2017, Clause 15;<br />\r\n- requirements
    for the instructions in 13.2.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 60974 is to be used in
    conjunction with IEC 60974-1.</p>"
