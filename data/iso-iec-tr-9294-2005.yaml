    <p>ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 offers guidance on the management of software documentation to managers responsible for the production of software or software-based products. This guidance is intended to assist managers in ensuring that effective documentation is produced in their organizations.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 addresses the policies, standards, procedures, resources and plans with which managers must concern themselves in order to manage software documentation effectively.</p>
    <p>The guidance given is intended to be applicable to all types of software, from the simplest program to the most complex software suite or software system. All types of software documentation are covered, relating to all stages of the software life cycle. </p>
    <p>The principles of software documentation management are the same whatever the size of a project. For small projects, much of the detail given in ISO/IEC TR 9294:2005 may not apply, but the principles remain the same. Managers may tailor the recommendations to their particular needs.</p>
    <p>The guidance given is from the point of view of software documentation management. Detailed advice is not provided on, for example, the content and layout of software documents.</p>
