  content: "IEC TS 62607-8-2:2021 There are two types of thermally stimulated current
    (TSC) measurement methods, classified by the origin of the current. One is generated
    by the detrapping of charges. The other one is generated by depolarization. The
    latter is frequently called thermally stimulated depolarization current (TSDC).
    This part of IEC 62607 focuses on the latter method, and specifies the measurement
    procedures to be developed for determining polarization properties of metal-oxide
    interfacial devices.<br />\r\nIEC TS 62607-8-2:2021 includes:<br />\r\n- outlines
    of the experimental procedures used to measure TSDC,<br />\r\n- methods of interpretation
    of results and discussion of data analysis, and<br />\r\n- case studies."
