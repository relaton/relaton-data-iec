  content: "IEC 61000-4-4:2012 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61000-4-4:2012 relates
    to the immunity of electrical and electronic equipment to repetitive electrical
    fast transients. It has the status of a basic EMC publication in accordance with
    IEC Guide 107. It gives immunity requirements and test procedures related to electrical
    fast transients/bursts. It additionally defines ranges of test levels and establishes
    test procedures. The object of this standard is to establish a common and reproducible
    reference in order to evaluate the immunity of electrical and electronic equipment
    when subjected to electrical fast transient/bursts on supply, signal, control
    and earth ports. The test method documented in this standard describes a consistent
    method to assess the immunity of an equipment or system against a defined phenomenon.
    This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2004 and
    its amendment 1 (2010). It constitutes a technical revision which improves and
    clarifies simulator specifications, test criteria and test setups."
