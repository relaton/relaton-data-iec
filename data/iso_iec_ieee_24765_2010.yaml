abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 provides a common vocabulary applicable to all
    systems and software engineering work. It was prepared to collect and standardize
    terminology. ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 is intended to serve as a useful reference
    for those in the information technology field, and to encourage the use of systems
    and software engineering standards prepared by ISO and liaison organizations IEEE
    Computer Society and Project Management Institute. ISO/IEC/IEEE 24765:2010 includes
    references to the active source standards for each definition so that the use
    of the term can be further explored.
