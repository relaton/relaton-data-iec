abstract:
- content: "IEC 61850-10:2012+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies standard techniques for testing
    of conformance of client, server and sampled value devices and engineering tools,
    as well as specific measurement techniques to be applied when declaring performance
    parameters. The use of these techniques will enhance the ability of the system
    integrator to integrate IEDs easily, operate IEDs correctly, and support the applications
    as intended. The major technical changes with regard to the previous edition are
    as follows:<br />\r\n- updates to server device conformance test procedures;<br
    />\r\n- additions of certain test procedures (client device conformance, sampled
    values device conformance, (engineering) tool related conformance, GOOSE performance)."
