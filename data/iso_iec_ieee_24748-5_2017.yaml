abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-5:2017 provides a common framework for planning and
    controlling the technical processes and activities to produce and sustain software
    products. The complete life cycle is covered by this document, from idea conception
    to the retirement of a software product. The framework described by this document
    provides for best practices in communication and cooperation among parties that
    plan for, develop, utilize, and manage modern software.<br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE
    24748-5:2017:<br />\r\n- specifies the required information items to be produced
    through the implementation of the required planning and control processes;<br
    />\r\n- specifies the required content of the required information items;<br />\r\n-
    gives guidelines for the format and content of the required and related information
    items; and<br />\r\n- details the processes necessary to develop and implement
    a software plan.<br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE 24748-5:2017 is intended to provide guidance
    for parties involved in the planning of software engineering at all stages of
    the software life cycle. It is intended to provide a common framework for two-party
    and multi-party collaborations and can be applied where the parties are from the
    same organization. This document can also be used by a single party.<br />\r\nISO/IEC/IEEE
    24748-5:2017 is applicable to:<br />\r\n- those who use ISO/IEC/IEEE FDIS 12207
    on projects dealing with software products and services related to those products;<br
    />\r\n- those who are responsible for the technical management of the development
    of software systems;<br />\r\n- organizations and individuals performing software
    development activities; and<br />\r\n- organizations and individuals developing
    information items during the development of software."
