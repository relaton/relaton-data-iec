abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-67:2017+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular aluminium winding wire of class 105 with a sole coating based on polyvinyl
    acetal resin, which may be modified providing it retains the chemical identity
    of the original resin and meets all specified wire requirements. The range of
    nominal conductor dimensions covered by this standard is:<br />\r\nMinimum width
    2,0 mm and minimum thickness 0,80 mm<br />\r\nMaximum width 16,0 mm and maximum
    thickness 5,60 mm<br />\r\nWires of grade 1 and grade 2 are included in this part
    of IEC 60317 and apply to the complete range of conductors. The specified combinations
    of width and thickness as well as the specific ratio width/thickness are given
    in IEC 60317-0-9. This publication is to be read in conjunction with IEC 60317-0-9:2015."
