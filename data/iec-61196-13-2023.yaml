  content: "IEC 61196-13:2023 specifies the materials and cable construction for semi-rigid
    coaxial communication cables with silicon dioxide dielectric, IEC type designation,
    identification, marking and labelling, standard rating and characteristics, requirements
    of finished cables, quality assessment, delivery and storage, etc.<br />\r\nThis
    part of IEC 61196 applies to semi-rigid coaxial communication cables with silicon
    dioxide dielectric and tubular outer conductor. These cables are intended for
    use in applications requiring extreme environments as well as in nuclear power
    plants, oil rigs and aircraft engines."
