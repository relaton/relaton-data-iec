abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 14496-10:2003 was developed jointly with the ITU-T in response
    to the growing need for higher compression of moving pictures for various applications
    such as digital storage media, television broadcasting, Internet streaming and
    real-time audiovisual communication. It is also designed to enable the use of
    the coded video representation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network
    environments. It is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide
    range of applications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities and services. The use
    of ISO/IEC 14496-10:2003 allows motion video to be manipulated as a form of computer
    data and to be stored on various storage media, transmitted and received over
    existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future broadcasting
    channels. In the course of creating ISO/IEC 14496-10:2003, various requirements
    from typical applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements
    have been developed, and these have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence,
    ISO/IEC 14496-10:2003 will facilitate video data interchange among different applications.</p><p>The
    coded representation specified in the syntax is designed to enable a high compression
    capability for a desired image quality. The algorithm is not lossless, as the
    exact source sample values are typically not preserved through the encoding and
    decoding processes. A number of techniques are defined that may be used to achieve
    highly efficient compression. The expected encoding algorithm (not specified in
    ISO/IEC 14496-10:2003) selects between inter and intra coding for block-shaped
    regions of each picture. Inter coding uses motion vectors for block-based inter
    prediction to exploit temporal statistical dependencies between different pictures.
    Intra coding uses various spatial prediction modes to exploit spatial statistical
    dependencies in the source signal for a single picture. Motion vectors and intra
    prediction modes may be specified for a variety of block sizes in the picture.
    The prediction residual is then further compressed using a transform to remove
    spatial correlation inside the transform block before it is quantised, producing
    an irreversible process that typically discards less important visual information
    while forming a close approximation to the source samples. Finally, the motion
    vectors or intra prediction modes are combined with the quantised transform coefficient
    information and encoded using either variable length codes or arithmetic coding.</p><p>Annexes
    A through E contain normative requirements and are an integral part of ISO/IEC
    14496-10:2003. Annex A defines three profiles (Baseline, Main and Extended), each
    being tailored to certain application domains, and defines the levels of capability
    within each profile. Annex B specifies syntax and semantics of a byte stream format
    for delivery of coded video as an ordered stream of bytes or bits. Annex C specifies
    the Hypothetical Reference Decoder and its use to check bitstream and decoder
    conformance. Annex D specifies syntax and semantics for Supplemental Enhancement
    Information message payloads. Annex E specifies syntax and semantics of the Video
    Usability Information parameters of the sequence parameter sets of coded video
    sequences.</p>"
