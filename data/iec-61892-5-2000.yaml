    This part of IEC 61892 specifies the characteristics for electrical installations in floating units,for use during transfer from one location to another and for use during the exploration and exploitation of petroleum resources.

    The requirements specified in this International Standard are based on the Code for the Construction and Equipment of Mobile Offshore Drilling Units (1989 MODU CODE) published by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and might include additional provisions.

    This part of IEC 61892 supersedes IEC publication 60092-505, third edition (1984) and its amendment 1 (1993).
