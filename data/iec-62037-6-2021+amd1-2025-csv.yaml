  content: "IEC 62037-6:2021+AMD1:2025 CSV defines the test fixtures and procedures
    recommended for measuring levels of passive intermodulation generated by antennas,
    typically used in wireless communication systems. The purpose is to define qualification
    and acceptance test methods for antennas for use in low intermodulation (low IM)
    applications. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2013.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- dynamic testing requirements
    updated to define impact energy and locations to apply impacts to devices under
    test."
