  content: "IEC 63171-2:2021 covers 2-way, shielded or unshielded, free and fixed
    connectors for data transmission up to 600 MHz, with current-carrying capacity,
    known as Type 2. It specifies the common dimensions, mechanical, electrical and
    transmission characteristics and environmental requirements as well as test specifications
    respectively.</br>\r\nThe form factor of these connectors allows their use for
    cable sharing with already installed TO’s for structured cabling.</br>\r\nThe
    overall performance of the transmission channel in such case has to be evaluated.</br>\r\nIntermateable
    and interoperable versions for circular connector for sealed applications including
    this connector are described in IEC 63171-5.</br>\r\nThe shielded and unshielded
    connectors are interoperable for their internal transmission performance and can
    be exchanged. The shielded version has improved alien crosstalk and coupling attenuation
    properties."
