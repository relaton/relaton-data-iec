abstract:
- content: IEC TR 61850-90-12:2015(E) provides definitions, guidelines, and recommendations
    for the engineering of WANs, in particular for protection, control and monitoring
    based on IEC 61850 and related standards. It addresses substation-to-substation
    communication, substation-to-control centre and control centre-to-control centre
    communication. In particular, this Technical Report addresses the most critical
    aspects of IEC 61850 such as protection related data transmission via GOOSE and
    SMVs, and the multicast transfer of large volumes of synchrophasor data. The Technical
    Report addresses issues such as topology, redundancy, traffic latency and quality
    of service, traffic management, clock synchronization, security and maintenance
    of the network. This Technical Report contains use cases that show how utilities
    tackle their WAN engineering. This Technical Report is intended for an audience
    familiar with electrical power automation based on IEC 61850 and particularly
    for data network engineers and system integrators. It is intended to help them
    to understand the technologies, configure a wide area network, define requirements,
    write specifications, select components and conduct tests.
