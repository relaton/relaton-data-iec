abstract:
- content: IEC 62481-10:2017(E) specifies guidelines for low-power mode management.
    Power saving is modular within a physical device. In the context of DLNA networked
    devices, each physical network interface can have various power modes, some of
    which can allow Layer 2 or Layer 3 connectivity to still be present, even when
    many of the other components of the device are powered down. Other physical components,
    such as screens, hard drives, and similar resources, can also support different
    power modes.
