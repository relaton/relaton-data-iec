  content: IEC TS 63457-1:2025 is a product family standard dealing with safety after
    repair, refurbishment, and remanufacturing of an appliance already placed on the
    market and subsequent safety testing of appliances within the scope of IEC TC
    61 and its subcommittees. This document takes precedence over horizontal and generic
    standards covering the same subject. When a Part 2 of the IEC TS 63457-2 series
    does not include additional requirements to cover hazards dealt with in this document,
    this document applies. All tests included in this document are conducted by a
    qualified person or by a supervised technician for specified activities. The concept
    of upgrade of an appliance and use of reused components are addressed in informative
    Annex A and informative Annex B. Additional requirements for upgrade apply as
    given in informative Annex B. Inspection and test documentation are prepared,
    for example, according to informative Annex C. Furthermore, a guidance on preparing
    a service manual by the manufacturer or remanufacturer is given in Annex D.
