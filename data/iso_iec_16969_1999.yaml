abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and
    optical characteristics of 120 mm</p><p>rewritable optical disks with capacities
    of 3,0 Gbytes and 6,0 Gbytes. It specifies the quality of the recorded and</p><p>unrecorded
    signals, the format of the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for
    information interchange</p><p>by means of such disks. The data can be written,
    read and overwritten many times using the phase change</p><p>method. These disks
    are identified as +RW.</p><p>This International Standard specifies</p><p>_ two
    related but different Types of this disk (see clause 7),</p><p>_ the conditions
    for conformance,</p><p>_ the environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated
    and stored,</p><p>_ the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of
    the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange</p><p>between data processing
    systems,</p><p>_ the format of the information on the disk, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error</p><p>correcting codes and the
    coding method,</p><p>_ the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk,
    thus enabling data processing systems to read the data</p><p>from the disk.</p><p>This
    International Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk
    drives. Together with a</p><p>standard for volume and file structure, it provides
    for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
