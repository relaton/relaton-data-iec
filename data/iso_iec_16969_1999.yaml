abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of 120 mm rewritable optical disks with capacities of 3,0 Gbytes and 6,0 Gbytes.
    It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals, the format of
    the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many times
    using the phase change method. These disks are identified as +RW.<br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies<br />\r\n_ two related but different Types of
    this disk (see clause 7),<br />\r\n_ the conditions for conformance,<br />\r\n_
    the environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored,<br />\r\n_
    the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to
    provide mechanical interchange between data processing systems,<br />\r\n_ the
    format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the
    tracks and sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method,<br />\r\n_
    the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing
    systems to read the data from the disk.<br />\r\nThis International Standard provides
    for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems."
