abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of 120 mm</p><p>rewritable
    optical disks with capacities of 3,0 Gbytes and 6,0 Gbytes. It specifies the quality
    of the recorded and</p><p>unrecorded signals, the format of the data and the recording
    method, thereby allowing for information interchange</p><p>by means of such disks.
    The data can be written, read and overwritten many times using the phase change</p><p>method.
    These disks are identified as +RW.</p><p>This International Standard specifies</p><p>_
    two related but different Types of this disk (see clause 7),</p><p>_ the conditions
    for conformance,</p><p>_ the environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated
    and stored,</p><p>_ the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of
    the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange</p><p>between data processing
    systems,</p><p>_ the format of the information on the disk, including the physical
    disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error</p><p>correcting codes and the
    coding method,</p><p>_ the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk,
    thus enabling data processing systems to read the data</p><p>from the disk.</p><p>This
    International Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk
    drives. Together with a</p><p>standard for volume and file structure, it provides
    for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
