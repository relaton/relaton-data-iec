abstract:
- content: "IEC 60068-3-7:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60068-3-7:2020 specifies
    a uniform and reproducible method of confirming that temperature test chambers
    conform to the requirements specified in the climatic test procedures of IEC 60068-2-1
    and IEC 60068-2-2, when loaded with either heat-dissipating or non heat-dissipating
    specimens under conditions which take into account air circulation inside the
    working space of the chamber. This document is intended primarily for users when
    conducting regular chamber performance monitoring. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2001. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- verbal forms have, in many parts,
    been changed to express requirements instead of recommendations ('shall' instead
    of 'should');<br />\r\n- Table 1 has been updated.</p><ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\"></ol>"
