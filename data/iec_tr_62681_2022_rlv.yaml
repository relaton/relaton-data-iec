abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62681:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 62681:2022
    provides general guidance on the electromagnetic environment issues of HVDC overhead
    transmission lines. It concerns the major parameters adopted to describe the electromagnetic
    properties of an HVDC overhead transmission line, including electric fields, ion
    current, magnetic fields, radio interference, and audible noise generated as a
    consequence of such effects. If the evaluation method and/or criteria of electromagnetic
    properties are not yet regulated, engineers in different countries can refer to
    this document to:<br />\r\n- support/guide the electromagnetic design of HVDC
    overhead transmission lines,<br />\r\n- limit the influence on the environment
    within acceptable ranges, and<br />\r\n- optimize engineering costs."
