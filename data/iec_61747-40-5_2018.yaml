abstract:
- content: IEC 61747-40-5:2018(E) is a mechanical performance testing procedure for
    cover glass used in electronic displays in mobile devices. This document focuses
    on the measurement of surface impact energy required to fracture a specimen due
    to the collision of sharp particles onto the surface of a cover glass. This is
    achieved by dropping a ball on a sheet of coated abrasives placed on the cover
    glass, which is rigidly supported. The failure mode is associated with damage
    introduction via sharp contact. Crack propagation is enhanced by central tension
    in the case of strengthened glass. This failure mode represents one of several
    field failure modes observed in mobile devices.
