  content: IEC/TS 62500:2008(E) specifies the targets assigned to highly accelerated
    tests, their basic principles, their scope of application and their implementation
    procedures. Is primarily intended for programme managers, designers, test managers,
    and RAMS experts to facilitate the draft of the specification and execution of
    highly accelerated tests. Is applicable to all programmes and is of primary interest
    to the industrial firms in charge of designing, developing and producing equipment
    built for these programmes, and also their customers.
