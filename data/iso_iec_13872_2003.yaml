abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 13872:2003 specifies the supplementary services Call Forwarding
    Unconditional (CFU), Call Forwarding Busy (CFB), Call Forwarding No Reply (CFNR)
    and Call Deflection (CD), which are applicable to various basic services supported
    by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in
    ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>SS-CFU, SS-CFB and SS-CFNR are supplementary services which
    apply during call establishment providing a diversion of an incoming call to another
    destination. SS-CD is a supplementary service which allows a served user to respond
    to an incoming call by requesting redirection of that call to another number specified
    in the response.</p><p>Supplementary service specifications are produced in three
    stages, according to the method described in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 13872:2003 contains
    the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of the Call Diversion supplementary services.
    The stage 1 specifications (Clauses 6, 7, 8 and 9) specify the supplementary services
    as seen by users of PISNs. The stage 2 specification (Clause 10) identifies the
    functional entities involved in the supplementary services and the information
    flows between them.</p>"
