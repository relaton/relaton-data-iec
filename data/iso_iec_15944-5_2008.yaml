abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-5:2008 is directed at being able to identify and reference laws and regulations
    impacting eBusiness scenarios and scenario components as external constraints.
    The primary source of such external constraints is jurisdictional domains.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 focuses on addressing the simple, i.e. definable, aspects
    of external constraints for which the source is a jurisdictional domain. A useful
    characteristic of external constraints is that at the sectoral, national and international
    levels, etc. focal points and recognized authorities often already exist. The
    rules and common business practices in many sectoral areas are already known.
    Use of ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 (and related standards) will facilitate the transformation
    of these external constraints (business rules) into specified, registered and
    reusable scenarios and scenario components.<br />\r\nThe Business Transaction
    Model, explained in ISO/IEC 15944-1, has two classes of constraints, namely:\r\n\r\n\tthose
    which are self-imposed and agreed to as commitments among the parties themselves,
    i.e. internal constraints; and\r\n\tthose which are imposed on the parties to
    a business transaction based on the nature of the good, service and/or rights
    exchanged, and the nature of the commitment made among the parties (including
    ability to make commitments, the location, etc.), i.e. external constraints.\r\n\r\nThe
    focus of ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 is on external constraints. Jurisdictional domains
    are the primary source of external constraints.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008
    provides the key concepts required for addressing the legal environment in developing
    the Business Operational View of business transactions and scenarios which involve
    and are required to support external constraints.<br />\r\nIt begins with an exploration
    of the jurisdictional domain as a source of external constraint on the business
    process, both from the perspective of a Person and as a Public Administration.
    It then presents key constraints governing ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 through principles
    and rules.<br />\r\nIt examines a key element in business transactions, that of
    the use of language. Jurisdictions can identify and, in some cases, impose the
    use of language in a business transaction. In this regard, the ISO/IEC 15944-5:2008
    looks at the relationship of the constraint imposed by a jurisdictional domain
    on the choice of language used.<br />\r\nPublic policy constraints are also examined
    and key requirements for their inclusion in external constraints are identified,
    especially where they can affect the modelling of Open-edi scenarios and the business
    transaction components of Persons, data and processes. In particular, there is
    a set of rules that govern the identification and categories of jurisdictional
    domains as individual states as well as sets of entities, both regional and international.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 also focuses on the identification of rules governing
    the formation and identification of jurisdictional domains. It identifies the
    more primitive subtypes of jurisdictional domains and includes two approaches
    for the unambiguous identification of referencing of (subtypes of) jurisdictional
    domain.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-5:2008 also provides checklists, through the use
    of templates, to guide the user through the mechanics of determining the source
    of the external constraint(s) where these are jurisdictional domains and determining
    the adequacy of the scenario specification as well as those of the scenario components.<br
    />\r\nAnnexes provide elaboration on the points raised in the main body."
