abstract:
- content: <p class="MsoNormal">This specification defines the requirements for the
    symbology known as MaxiCode. MaxiCode is a fixed-size matrix symbology which is
    made up of offset rows of hexagonal modules arranged around a unique finder pattern.
    This specification specifies the MaxiCode symbology characteristics, data character
    encodation, symbol formats, dimensions and print quality requirements, error correction
    rules, decoding algorithm, and user-selectable application parameters. MaxiCode
    includes special encodation modes for use in destination sortation symbols by
    carriers in the transport industry.</p>
