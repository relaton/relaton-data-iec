abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24729-4:2009 provides guidance to systems designers to help
    them determine potential threats to data security of the tag and tag-to-reader
    communication in an RFID system, and appropriate countermeasures to provide data
    security. Although important, it is beyond the scope of ISO/IEC TR 24729-4:2009
    to address security aspects of the reader-to-host and back-end enterprise modules.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 24729-4:2009 is not intended to specifically address consumer privacy concerns;
    however, since data and personal privacy depend on the use of appropriate security
    measures, privacy is addressed in general terms. Data access security provides
    a measure of personal privacy protection by mitigating the potential for unauthorized
    reading of data on a tag. However, not all data access security countermeasures
    provide the same level of protection.</p>"
