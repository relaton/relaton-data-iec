abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23001-5:2008 specifies BSDL (Bitstream Syntax Description Language),
    a language based on W3C XML Schema to describe the structure of a bitstream with
    an XML document named BS Description.</p><p>BSDL provides a normative grammar
    to describe in XML the high-level syntax of a bitstream; the resulting XML document
    is called a Bitstream Syntax Description (BS Description, BSD). This description
    is not meant to replace the original binary format, but acts as an additional
    layer, similar to metadata. In most cases, it will not describe the bitstream
    on a bit-per-bit basis, but rather address its high-level structure, e.g., how
    the bitstream is organized in layers or packets of data. Furthermore, the BS Description
    is itself scalable, which means it may describe the bitstream at different syntactic
    layers, e.g., finer or coarser levels of detail, depending on the application.</p><p>This
    language was initially developed in the context of Digital Item Adaptation (ISO/IEC
    21000-7) as a generic tool for adapting scalable multimedia content. However,
    its use is not restricted to adaptation and may be relevant for any application
    parsing a bitstream. This is why ISO/IEC 23001-5:2008 extracts the BSDL specification
    from ISO/IEC 21000-7 to make it available to other contexts.</p>"
