    <p>ISO/IEC 25062:2006 provides a standard method for reporting usability test findings. The format is designed for reporting results of formal usability tests in which quantitative measurements were collected, and is particularly appropriate for summative/comparative testing. The CIF does not indicate how to perform a usability test but provides guidance on how to report the results of a usability test. The CIF targets two audiences: usability professionals and stakeholders in an organization. Stakeholders can use the usability data to help make informed decisions concerning the release of software products or the procurement of such products. </p>
    <p>The format includes the following elements:</p>
    <ul><li>the description of the product,</li><li>the goals of the test,</li><li>the test participants</li><li>the tasks the users were asked to perform,</li><li>the experimental design of the test,</li><li>the method or process by which the test was conducted,</li><li>the usability measures and data collection methods, and</li><li>the numerical results.</li></ul>
