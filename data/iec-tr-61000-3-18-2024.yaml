  content: "IEC TR 61000-3-18:2024 which is a technical report, reports on the development
    of a methodology for adapting IEC equipment emission limits from IEC 61000-3-2
    and IEC 61000-3-12 for use in regions not covered by these documents. It identifies
    gaps in the existing equipment emission limit standards concerning their international
    applicability and identifies public power system characteristics important for
    the evaluation of harmonic voltage performance. The purpose of adapting the above-mentioned
    IEC equipment harmonic emission standards in a particular region is to maintain
    similar electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of equipment up to 75 A per phase
    in the public power systems in those regions.<br />\r\nNOTE The boundaries between
    the various voltage levels differ amongst different countries (see IEC 60050‑601:1985,
    601-01-28). This document uses the following terms when referring to 50 Hz and
    60 Hz system voltages:<br />\r\n- low voltage (LV) refers to Un ≤ 1 kV;<br />\r\n-
    medium voltage (MV) refers to 1 kV < Un ≤ 35 kV;<br />\r\n- high voltage (HV)
    refers to 35 kV < Un ≤ 230 kV.<br />\r\nEMC requirements can have economic and
    societal impacts; these have not been considered in the development of this document.
    The consideration of these factors generally occurs in the technical committees
    working on development and maintenance of emission limit standards."
