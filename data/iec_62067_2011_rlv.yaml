abstract:
- content: "IEC 62067:2011 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 62067:2011 specifies
    test methods and requirements for power cable systems, cables with extruded insulation
    and their accessories for fixed installations, for rated voltages above 150 kV
    (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 170 kV) up to and including 500 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub>
    = 550 kV). The requirements apply to single-core cables and to their accessories
    for usual conditions of installation and operation, but not to special cables
    and their accessories, such as submarine cables, for which modifications to the
    standard tests may be necessary or special test conditions may need to be devised.
    This standard does not cover transition joints between cables with extruded insulation
    and paper insulated cables. The significant technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- addition of the extension of prequalification
    test, requiring significant less time to be completed compared with the full prequalification
    test;<br />\r\n- during the routine tests on the main insulation of prefabricated
    accessories the required sensitivity level for the partial discharge test is reduced
    from 10 pC to 5 pC.<br />\r\nNOTE: For a more detailed history of events leading
    up to this second edition, see the introduction."
