abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 20004:2015 refines the AVA_VAN assurance family activities defined
    in ISO/IEC 18045 and provides more specific guidance on the identification, selection
    and assessment of relevant potential vulnerabilities in order to conduct an ISO/IEC
    15408 evaluation of a software target of evaluation. This Technical Report leverages
    publicly available information security resources to support the method of scoping
    and implementing ISO/IEC 18045 vulnerability analysis activities. The Technical
    Report currently uses the common weakness enumeration (CWE) and the common attack
    pattern enumeration and classification (CAPEC), but does not preclude the use
    of any other appropriate resources. Furthermore, this Technical Report is not
    meant to address all possible vulnerability analysis methods, including those
    that fall outside the scope of the activities outlined in ISO/IEC 18045.<p>ISO/IEC
    TR 20004:2015 does not define evaluator actions for certain high assurance ISO/IEC
    15408 components, where there is as yet no generally agreed guidance.</p>
