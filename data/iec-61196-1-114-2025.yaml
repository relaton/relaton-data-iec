  content: "IEC 61196-1-114:2025 specifies a test method to determine the inductance
    characteristics of coaxial communication cables. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the term \"inductance\" has
    been revised;<br />\r\nb) the necessary abbreviated term is added;<br />\r\nc)
    the length and layout of the test sample have been revised;<br />\r\nd) the measuring
    procedure has been revised;<br />\r\ne) the additional information for the bending
    effect on coaxial cable inductance test is provided in Annex A."
