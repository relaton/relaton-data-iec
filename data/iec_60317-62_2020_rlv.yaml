abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-62:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60317-62:2020
    specifies the requirements of polyester glass-fibre wound, silicone resin or varnish
    impregnated bare, grade 1 or grade 2 enamelled rectangular copper winding wires,
    temperature index 200. The impregnating agent is a silicone containing resin or
    varnish.The range of nominal conductor dimensions covered by this document is:<br
    />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm max.
    5,60 mm.<br />\r\nNOTE For this type of wire, the heat shock test is inappropriate
    and therefore a heat shock temperature cannot be established. Consequently, a
    class based on the requirements for temperature index and heat shock temperature
    cannot be specified.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision to the title of the standard to more precisely
    describe the construction of the wire;<br />\r\n- revision to Clause 1, the scope
    of the standard, to provide more detail of the wire construction;<br />\r\n- revision
    to 3.2.2, general winding wire requirements of the glass fibre covering."
