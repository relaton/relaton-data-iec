abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63337:2024 provides requirements, test conditions and tests to
    validate characteristics including the service life of customized DC-link film
    capacitors for use in motor vehicle components.<br />\r\nStandard DC-link capacitors
    qualified according to other IEC standards or AEC-Q200 are excluded from the scope
    of this document.<br />\r\nThe requirements, test conditions and tests listed
    in this document apply to customized film capacitors developed for use in motor
    vehicle power electronics for the application as a DC-link capacitor in HV applications
    or in the intermediate circuit of the 48 V on-board electrical system.<br />\r\nThese
    qualification requirements can be expanded or adapted for the application of technologically
    innovative designs, if necessary. The content and scope of supplements is therefore
    to be specified and documented in coordination between the responsible parties
    prior to sourcing.<br />\r\nPower electronics in the motor vehicle need to be
    tested in accordance with the environmental qualification standards of the vehicle
    manufacturers.<br />\r\nThe tests in this document do not replace the tests specified
    in the Component Requirement Specifications for complete vehicle components or
    additional or deviating further requirements, test conditions and tests described
    therein.<br />\r\nThis document contains no tests to validate the thermal interface
    between capacitors, power electronics and the cooling system on the component
    level."
