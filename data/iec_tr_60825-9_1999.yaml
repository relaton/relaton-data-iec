abstract:
- content: Provides guidance for the protection of persons from incoherent optical
    radiation in the wavelength range from 180nm to 1 mm by indicating safe levels
    of optical radiation which are believed to be safe for most individuals in the
    sense that exposure at or below these levels will create no adverse effects.
