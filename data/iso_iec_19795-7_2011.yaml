abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011 establishes a mechanism for measuring the core
    algorithmic capabilities of biometric comparison algorithms running on ISO/IEC
    7816 integrated circuit cards. Specifically, ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011</p><ul><li>instantiates
    a mechanism for on-card biometric comparison testing;</li><li>standardizes procedures
    for the measurement of the accuracy of on-card biometric comparison implementations
    running on object-based, test-specific sample cards;</li><li>standardizes procedures
    for the measurement of durations of the various operations;</li><li>gives examples
    for matching ISO/IEC 19794-2:2005 compact card minutiae templates.</li></ul><p>The
    following are specifically not within the scope of ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011:</p><ul><li>procedures
    for securing the communications channel, including cryptographic protection of
    the biometric templates;</li><li>procedures for protection of sample or template
    integrity using digital signatures;</li><li>authentication of the card and reader;</li><li>selection
    or use of transmission protocols (e.g. contactless);</li><li>profiles of specific
    data interchange standards;</li><li>procedures for evaluation of readers, including
    performance, conformance and interoperability;</li><li>procedures for evaluation
    of ruggedness or durability of the card;</li><li>on-card template generation (e.g.
    extraction of minutiae from images);</li><li>template update or adaptation;</li><li>formal
    conformance tests of ISO/IEC 7816-4 and ISO/IEC 7816-11;</li><li>testing of devices
    not conforming to ISO/IEC 7816, including all system-on-card devices.</li></ul>"
