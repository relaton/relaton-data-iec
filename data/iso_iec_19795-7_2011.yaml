abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011 establishes a mechanism for measuring the core algorithmic
    capabilities of biometric comparison algorithms running on ISO/IEC 7816 integrated
    circuit cards. Specifically, ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011instantiates a mechanism for
    on-card biometric comparison testing;standardizes procedures for the measurement
    of the accuracy of on-card biometric comparison implementations running on object-based,
    test-specific sample cards;standardizes procedures for the measurement of durations
    of the various operations;gives examples for matching ISO/IEC 19794-2:2005 compact
    card minutiae templates.The following are specifically not within the scope of
    ISO/IEC 19795-7:2011:procedures for securing the communications channel, including
    cryptographic protection of the biometric templates;procedures for protection
    of sample or template integrity using digital signatures;authentication of the
    card and reader;selection or use of transmission protocols (e.g. contactless);profiles
    of specific data interchange standards;procedures for evaluation of readers, including
    performance, conformance and interoperability;procedures for evaluation of ruggedness
    or durability of the card;on-card template generation (e.g. extraction of minutiae
    from images);template update or adaptation;formal conformance tests of ISO/IEC
    7816-4 and ISO/IEC 7816-11;testing of devices not conforming to ISO/IEC 7816,
    including all system-on-card devices.
