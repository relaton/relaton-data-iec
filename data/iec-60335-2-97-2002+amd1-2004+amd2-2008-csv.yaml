abstract:
- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Deals with the safety of electric drives for rolling equipment such as
    shutters, blinds, and awnings, intended for household and similar purposes, their
    rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase and 480 V for other appliances.
    Examples of rolling equipment that can be driven are awnings; blinds; grilles;
    projection screens; shutters for doors and windows. Drives for equipment with
    a spring-controlled driven part, such as a folding arm awning, are also within
    the scope of this standard. This consolidated version consists of the second edition
    (2002), its amendment 1 (2004) and its amendments 2 (2008). Therefore, no need
    to order amendments in addition to this publication.
