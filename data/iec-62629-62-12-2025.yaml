  content: "IEC 62629-62-12:2025 specifies the standard measuring conditions and measurement
    methods for determining image quality for 3D displays that produce virtual images,
    such as 3D heads‑up displays in which the 3D visual information is superimposed
    with the outside world. Eyewear displays are however beyond the scope of this
    document.<br />\r\nThe scope of this document does not intend to include eyewear
    displays considering the difference between a head-up display and an eyewear display
    in the aspect of eye box size and field of view. The eye-tracking function is
    disabled in the image quality measurement of this document."
