abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29431-18-10:2011 describes a service definition which is compliant with the UPnP
    Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a service type referred to herein
    as InboundConnectionConfig service. The InboundConnectionConfig service is a UPnP
    service that allows control points to configure the parameters that will enable
    the service to test if the host device is reachable from the internet. InboundConnectionConfig
    uses Dynamic DNS to manage at least one public address for home-network services;
    it uses STUN to ensure that any intermediate NAT device is navigatable, i.e. it
    is a full-cone NAT. Thus, this service provides control points with the following
    functionality:<br />\r\n- Configure the dynamic DNS client co-located with the
    service,<br />\r\n- Configure the STUN client co-located with the service,<br
    />\r\n- Check if the device hosting the service is reachable from the internet."
