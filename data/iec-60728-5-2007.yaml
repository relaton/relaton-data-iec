  content: 'It defines the characteristics of equipment used in the headends of terrestrial
    broadcast and satellite receiving systems (without satellite outdoor units and
    without those broadband amplifiers in the headend as described in IEC 60728-3).
    The satellite outdoor units for FSS are described in ETSI ETS 300 158, for BSS
    in ETSI ETS 300 249. Test methods for both types (FSS and BSS) of satellite outdoor
    units are laid down in ETSI ETS 300 457. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to      the previous  edition: Revised  title  and  scope   Clause  3,
    several  new  terms   and  definitions Subclause 4.1, Methods  of measurement  for
    digitally modulated signals Subclause 4.6.2, RF signal-to-noise ratio (SD,RF/N)
    for digitally modulated signals Subclause 4.8.2, Procedure      for the measurement  of
    group delay variation on DVB channel converters Subclause 4.9, Phase noise       of  an  RF
    carrier  Subclause 4.15,  Decoding margin  (Teletext).   Annex D,   Special national
    conditions.   Annex E, Correction factors  for noise.  Annex F,   Digital  signal
    level and   bandwidth.  Annex G,   Minimum  frequency distance of  converted satellite
    signals in the IF  range.   Annex H,  Measurement  errors which  occur due to
    mismatched equipment.    .Annex  I, Correction  factor  for spectrum   analyser'
