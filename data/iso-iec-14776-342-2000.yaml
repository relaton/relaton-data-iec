  content: The SCSI command set is designed to provide efficient peer-to-peer operation
    of input&#x2F;output devices (disks, tapes, printers, etc.) by an operating system,
    The SCSI command set assumes a command-response protocol. Action on SCSI commands
    shall not be deemed completed until a response is received. The response shall
    include a status that indicates the final disposition of the command. The SCSI
    command set provides multiple operating systems concurrent control over one or
    more input&#x2F;output devices. However, the multiple operating systems should
    properly coordinate their actions or data corruption will result. This standard
    defines commands that assist with coordination between multiple operating systems.
    This standard defines a device model for SCSI storage arrays, commonly known as
    RAID devices. This standard defines the SCSI commands that may apply to SCSI storage
    arrays and the SCSI commands that are uniquely for SCSI storage arrays. It is
    intended to be the choice for new designs over the original SCSI-3 Controller
    Commands (SCC) standard. Several new high level service actions have been added
    to this standard that simplify configurations.
