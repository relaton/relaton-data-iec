  content: IEC TR 62933-2-200:2021(E) presents a case study of electrical energy storage
    (EES) systems located in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations with photovoltaic
    (PV) power generation (PV-EES-EV charging stations) with a voltage level of 20
    kV and below. EES systems are highlighted in this document because they are a
    desired option to make the charging stations (especially the high-power fast charging
    stations) grid-friendly, improve the self-consumption of clean energy generation,
    and increase the revenue of stations. In this application, EES systems show excellent
    performance by running in a variety of available operating modes, such as peak
    shaving, power smoothing, load tracing, time-of-use (TOU) price arbitrage, and
    ancillary services. The general duty cycle is recommended based on the summary
    of the operation characteristics of the EES systems.
