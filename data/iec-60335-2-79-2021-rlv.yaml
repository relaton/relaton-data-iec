  content: "IEC 60335-2-79:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-79:2021
    deals with the safety of high-pressure cleaners without traction drive, intended
    for household and commercial indoor or outdoor use, having a rated pressure not
    less than 2,5 MPa and not exceeding 35 MPa. It also applies to steam cleaners
    and those parts of hot water high pressure cleaners incorporating a steam stage
    which have a capacity not exceeding 100 l, a rated pressure not exceeding 2,5
    MPa and a product of capacity and rated pressure not exceeding 5 MPa·l. They are
    not equipped with a traction drive. The following power systems of the drive for
    the high pressure pump are covered:<br />\r\n- mains powered motors up to a rated
    voltage of 250 V for single-phase machines and 480 V for other machines,<br />\r\n-
    battery-operated motors,<br />\r\n- internal combustion engines,<br />\r\n- hydraulic
    or pneumatic motors.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n- high
    pressure water jet machines having a rated pressure exceeding 35 MPa;<br />\r\n-
    liquid or steam cleaners intended for domestic use (IEC 60335-2-54);<br />\r\n-
    hand-held and transportable motor-operated electric tools (IEC 60745 series, IEC
    61029 series, IEC 62841 series);<br />\r\n- appliances for medical purposes (IEC
    60601);<br />\r\n- agricultural sprayers (ISO 4254-6);<br />\r\n- non-liquid,
    solid abrasive cleaners;<br />\r\n- machines designed to be part of a production
    process;<br />\r\n- machines designed for use in corrosive or explosive environments
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- machines designed for use in vehicles or on
    board of ships or aircraft.<br />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the
    fourth edition published in 2016. It constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition (minor changes are not listed):<br />\r\n- editorial and technical
    alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\n- clarification on hand-held and battery-operated
    high pressure cleaners;<br />\r\n- general editorial improvements.<br />\r\nThis
    part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/61880\">IEC
    60335-1</a> and its amendments. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition
    (2020) of that standard."
