abstract:
- content: IEC 62288:2021 specifies the general requirements, methods of testing,
    and required test results, for the presentation of navigation-related information
    on shipborne navigational displays in support of IMO resolutions MSC.191(79) as
    amended by MSC.466(101) in June 2019, and where applicable MSC.302(87). This document
    also supports the guidelines included in the related IMO Circulars MSC.1/Circ.1609
    on the standardization of user interface design for navigation equipment and SN.1/Circ.243
    as revised in June 2019 on the presentation of navigation related symbols, terms,
    and abbreviations. This document also specifies the presentation of AIS data reports
    and the AIS Application Specific Messages defined for international use in IMO
    SN.1/Circ.289 and intended to be received by a ship for display onboard.
