abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 63088:2017(E) describes a reference architecture model in the form
    of a cubic layer model, which shows technical objects (assets) in the form of
    layers, and allows them to be described, tracked over their entire lifetime (or
    “vita”) and assigned to technical and/or organizational hierarchies. It also describes
    the structure and function of Industry 4.0 components as essential parts of the
    virtual representation of assets.
