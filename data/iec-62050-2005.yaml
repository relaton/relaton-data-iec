  content: Specifies a standard for use of very high-speed integrated circuit hardware
    description language (VHDL) to model synthesizable register-transfer level digital
    logic. A standard syntax and semantics for VHDL register-transfer level synthesis
    is defined. The subset of the VHDL language, which is synthesizable, is described,
    and nonsynthesizable VHDL constructs are identified that should be ignored or
    flagged as errors.
