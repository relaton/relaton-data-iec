abstract:
- content: 'IEC TS 62462:2017(E) describes methods meant to assist users of ultrasound
    physiotherapy systems in checking the performance of such systems. It is applicable
    primarily to physiotherapists, general medical practitioners, chiropractors, osteopaths,
    beauty therapists, sports professionals, biomedical engineers, medical physicists,
    medical device service agents, commercial testers, test houses or manufacturers.
    This new edition includes the following significant technical change with respect
    to the previous edition: it includes a novel method for periodic testing regarding
    possible changes of the effective radiating area using thermochromic absorbers
    in a new Annex E.'
