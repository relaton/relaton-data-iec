  content: "IEC 60332-3-22:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60332-3-22:2018
    covers category A for methods of test for the assessment of vertical flame spread
    of vertically mounted bunched wires or cables, electrical or optical, under defined
    conditions. This document relates to cables installed on the test ladder to achieve
    a nominal total volume of non-metallic material of 7 l/m of test sample. The flame
    application time is 40 min. The method of mounting uses the front of the ladder,
    a standard or wide ladder being used for cables having a conductor cross-section
    greater than 35 mm2 according to the number of test pieces required, and a standard
    ladder for conductor cross-sections 35 mm2 and smaller. The category is intended
    for general use where high volumes of non-metallic material are required to be
    evaluated. The test is intended for type approval testing. The requirements for
    the selection of cables for testing are given in Annex A. The flame spread is
    measured as the extent of damage of the cable sample. This procedure can be used
    to demonstrate the cable’s ability to limit flame spread. A recommended performance
    requirement is given in Annex B. This second edition cancels and replaces the
    first edition published in 2000 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) adjustments have been
    made to the title, and elsewhere, to emphasise the standard is applicable to optical
    fibre cables as well as metallic conductor types;<br />\r\nb) details of the way
    in which cables are mounted on the ladder have been better defined in order to
    improve repeatability and reproducibility.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group
    safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
