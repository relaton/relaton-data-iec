abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026-1:2019 This document defines assurance-related terms
    and establishes an organized set of concepts and relationships to form a basis
    for shared understanding across user communities for assurance. It provides information
    to users of the other parts of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 including the combined use of
    multiple parts. The essential concept introduced by ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 (all parts)
    is the statement of claims in an assurance case and the support of those claims
    through argumentation and evidence. These claims are in the context of assurance
    for properties of systems and software within life cycle processes for the system
    or software product.<br />\r\nAssurance for a service being operated and managed
    on an ongoing basis is not covered in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 (all parts).<br />\r\nA
    variety of potential users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 (all parts) exists including
    developers and maintainers of assurance cases and those who wish to develop, sustain,
    evaluate or acquire a system that possesses requirements for specific properties
    in such a way as to be more certain of those properties and their requirements.
    ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 (all parts) uses concepts and terms consistent with ISO/IEC/IEEE
    12207 and ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288 and generally consistent with the ISO/IEC 25000 series,
    but the potential users of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 (all parts) need to understand the
    differences from concepts and terms to which they may be accustomed. This document
    attempts to clarify these differences.<br />\r\nThe primary purpose of this document
    is to aid users of the other parts of ISO/IEC/IEEE 15026 by providing context,
    concepts and explanations for assurance, assurance cases and integrity levels.
    While essential to assurance practice, details regarding exactly how to measure,
    demonstrate or analyse particular properties are not covered. These are the subjects
    of more specialized standards of which a number are referenced and included in
    the Bibliography."
