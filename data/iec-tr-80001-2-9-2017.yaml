  content: "IEC TR 80001-2-9:2017(E) establishes a security case framework and provides
    guidance to health care delivery organizations (HDO) and medical device manufacturers
    (MDM) for identifying, developing, interpreting, updating and maintaining security
    cases for networked medical devices. Use of this part of 80001 is intended to
    be one of the possible means to bridge the gap between MDMs and HDOs in providing
    adequate information to support the HDOs risk management of IT-networks. This
    document leverages the requirements set out in ISO/IEC 15026-2 for the development
    of assurance cases. It is not intended that this security case framework will
    replace a risk management strategy, rather, the intention is to complement risk
    management and in turn provide a greater level of assurance for a medical device
    by:<br />\r\n- mapping specific risk management steps to each of the IEC TR 80001-2-2
    security capabilities, identifying associated threats and vulnerabilities and
    presenting them in the format of a security case with the inclusion of a re-useable
    security pattern;<br />\r\n- providing guidance for the selection of appropriate
    security controls to establish security capabilities and presenting them as part
    of the security case pattern (IEC TR 80001-2-8 provides examples of such security
    controls);<br />\r\n- providing evidence to support the implementation of a security
    control, hence providing confidence in the establishment of each of the security
    capabilities.<br />\r\nThe purpose of developing the security case is to demonstrate
    confidence in the establishment of IEC TR 80001-2-2 security capabilities. The
    quality of artifacts gathered and documented during the development of the security
    case is agreed and documented as part of a responsibility agreement between the
    relevant stakeholders. This document provides guidance for one such methodology,
    through the use of a specific security pattern, to develop and interpret security
    cases in a systematic manner."
