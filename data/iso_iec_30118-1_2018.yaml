abstract:
- content: "The OCF specifications are divided into two sets of documents:<br />\r\n-
    Core Specification documents: The Core Specification documents specify the Framework,
    i.e., the OCF core architecture, interfaces, protocols and services to enable
    OCF profiles implementation for Internet of Things (IoT) usages and ecosystems.<br
    />\r\n- Vertical Profiles Specification documents: The Vertical Profiles Specification
    documents specify the OCF profiles to enable IoT usages for different market segments
    such as smart home, industrial, healthcare, and automotive. The Application Profiles
    Specification is built upon the interfaces and network security of the OCF core
    architecture defined in the Core Specification.<br />\r\nThis document is the
    OCF Core specification which specifies the Framework and core architecture."
