abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63043:2020(E), which is a technical report, describes common practices
    and state of the art for renewable energy power forecasting technology, including
    general data demands, renewable energy power forecasting methods and forecasting
    error evaluation. For the purposes of this document, renewable energy refers to
    variable renewable energy, which mainly comprises wind power and photovoltaic
    (PV) power – these are the focus of the document. Other variable renewable energies,
    like concentrating solar power, wave power and tidal power, etc., are not presented
    in this document, since their capacity is small, while hydro power forecasting
    is a significantly different field, and so not covered here.<br />\r\nThe objects
    of renewable energy power forecasting can be wind turbines, or a wind farm, or
    a region with lots of wind farms (respectively PV systems, PV power stations and
    regions with high PV penetration). This document focuses on providing technical
    guidance concerning forecasting technologies of multiple spatial and temporal
    scales, probabilistic forecasting, and ramp event forecasting for wind power and
    PV power.<br />\r\nThis document outlines the basic aspects of renewable energy
    power forecasting technology. This is the first IEC document related to renewable
    energy power forecasting. The contents of this document will find an application
    in the following potential areas:<br />\r\n• support the development and future
    research for renewable energy power forecasting technology, by showing current
    state of the art;<br />\r\n• evaluation of the forecasting performance during
    the design and operation of renewable energy power forecasting system;<br />\r\n•
    provide information for benchmarking renewable forecasting technologies, including
    methods used, data required and evaluation techniques"
