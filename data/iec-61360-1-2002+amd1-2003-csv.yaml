- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Provides a firm basis for the clear and unambiguous definition of characteristic
    properties (data element types) of all elements of electrotechnical systems from
    basic components to subassemblies and full systems. Although originally conceived
    in the context of providing a basis for the exchange of information on electric/electronic
    components, may be used in areas outside the original conception such as assemblies
    of components and electrotechnical systems and subsystems. Provides for establishing
    a classification hierarchy and the allocation of applicable and relevant properties
    to each of the classes so established in order to describe fully the characteristics
    of objects belonging to that class. Provision is also made for definition of the
    terms used in classification. Facilitates the exchange of data describing electrotechnical
    systems through a defined structure for the information to be exchanged in a computer-sensible
    form. Closely associated with this part of IEC 61360 is IEC 61360-2. This part
    contains the information model, using the EXPRESS modelling language. Use of this
    information model allows dictionary information to be exchanged between different
    systems using the STEP Physical File Format as defined in ISO 10303-21. It has
    the status of a horizontal standard in accordance with IEC Guide 108. This consolidated
    version consists of the second edition (2002) and its amendment 1 (2003). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.
