abstract:
- content: "IEC 60475:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60475:2022 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 60475:2011
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 10 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 60475:2022 is applicable to the sampling procedure used for insulating
    liquids in delivery containers and in electrical equipment such as power and instrument
    transformers, reactors, bushings, oil-filled cables, oil-filled tank-type capacitors,
    switchgear and load tap changers (LTCs). This document applies to liquids the
    viscosity of which at the sampling temperature is less than 1 500 mm2/s (or cSt).
    It applies to mineral oils and non-mineral oils (such as synthetic esters, natural
    esters, vegetable oils or silicones)."
