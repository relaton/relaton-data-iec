abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 21000 (MPEG-21) defines an open framework for multimedia delivery
    and consumption, with both the content creator and content consumer as focal points.
    The vision for MPEG-21 is to define a multimedia framework to  enable transparent
    and augmented use of multimedia resources across a wide range of networks and
    devices  used by different communities.   The basic architectural concept in MPEG-21
    is the Digital Item. Digital Items are structured digital objects, including a
    standard representation and identification, and metadata. They are the basic unit
    of transaction in the MPEG-21 framework. Many MPEG-21 applications have the requirement
    to uniquely identify   Digital Items.   ISO/IEC 21000-3:2003 provides a simple
    but flexible mechanism to:    Uniquely identify Digital Items and parts thereof
    (including resources);  Uniquely identify IP related to the Digital Items (and
    parts thereof), for example abstractions;  Uniquely identify Description Schemes;  Use
    identifiers to link Digital Items with related information such as descriptive
    metadata (non-normative).     The DII specification does  not  specify new identification
    systems for the content elements for which identification and description schemes
    already exist and are in use.   Identifiers covered by this specification can
    be associated with Digital Items by including them in a specific place in the
    Digital Item Declaration (ISO/IEC 21000-2).'
