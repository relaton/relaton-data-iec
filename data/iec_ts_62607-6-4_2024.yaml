abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-6-4:2024 has been prepared by IEC technical committee 113:
    Nanotechnology for electrotechnical products and systems. It is a Technical Specification.<br
    />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in
    2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) changed the document title to better reflect its purpose and application:<br
    />\r\nold title: Graphene – Surface conductance measurement using resonant cavity<br
    />\r\nnew title: Graphene based materials – Surface conductance: non-contact microwave
    resonant cavity method.<br />\r\nb) replaced former Figure 1 with new Figure 1
    and Figure 2, to better illustrate the method’s fundamentals and its implementation
    for a non-technical reader.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 62607 establishes a standardized
    method to determine the key control characteristic<br />\r\na) surface conductance<br
    />\r\nfor films of graphene and graphene-based materials by the<br />\r\nb) non-contact
    microwave resonant cavity method<br />\r\nThe non-contact microwave resonant cavity
    method monitors the microwave resonant frequency shifts and changes in the cavity’s
    quality factor during the insertion of the specimen into the microwave cavity,
    as a function of the specimen surface area. The empty cavity is an air-filled
    standard R100 rectangular waveguide operated at one of the resonant frequency
    modes, typically at 7,5 GHz [4].<br />\r\n1) The method is applicable for graphene
    materials which are synthesized by chemical vapour deposition (CVD) on metal substrates,
    epitaxial growth on silicon carbide (SiC), obtained from reduced graphene oxide
    (rGO), or mechanically exfoliated from graphite [5].<br />\r\n2) This measurement
    does not explicitly depend on the thickness of the nano-carbon layer. The thickness
    of the specimen does not need to be known, but it is assumed that the lateral
    dimensions are uniform over the specimen area.<br />\r\nNOTE In some countries,
    the R100 standard waveguide is referenced as WR-90."
