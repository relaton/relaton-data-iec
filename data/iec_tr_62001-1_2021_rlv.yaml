abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62001-1:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 62001-1:2021
    deals with the specification and design evaluation of AC side harmonic performance
    and AC side filters for HVDC schemes. It is intended to be primarily for the use
    of the utilities and consultants who are responsible for issuing the specifications
    for new HVDC projects and evaluating designs proposed by prospective suppliers.
    This document provides guidance on the specifications of AC filters for high-voltage
    direct current (HVDC) systems with line-commutated converters and filter performance
    calculation. The scope of this document covers AC side filtering for the frequency
    range of interest in terms of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances.
    Where the term \"HVDC converter\" or \"HVDC station\" is referred to without qualification,
    in this document, it is understood to refer to LCC technology. It excludes filters
    designed to be effective in the power line carrier (PLC) and radio interference
    spectra. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- general updating of the document to
    reflect changes in practice;<br />\r\n- 10.2.4 on fuseless capacitors has been
    transferred to IEC TR 62001-4;<br />\r\n- Clause 11 on future developments has
    been expanded;<br />\r\n- 10.3.3 and Annex F on voltage sourced converters have
    been deleted as their content is covered by IEC TR 62543."
