abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 defines the architecture for security and file
    management for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interface standards for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices. It provides a common technical specification for security and
    file management for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 specifies architecture
    for</p><ul><li> untraceability,</li><li> security services, and</li><li> file
    management</li></ul><p>as a further optional extension of the air interface. Both
    security and file management are defined in alignment with existing air interfaces
    and ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 only covers extensions on security and file management
    beyond the scope of the ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012
    defines various security features called<em>security mechanisms</em> that can
    be implemented by a tag depending on the application. A tag can support one, a
    subset, or all of the specified security mechanisms. For an interrogator it is
    possible to get information about the security mechanisms that are actually implemented
    and supported by a tag. Moreover, it has been considered that adding new security
    mechanisms remains possible. Besides signaling the presence of certain security
    services, further details of the mechanisms such as utilized encryption algorithm
    and key length also need to be specified and accessible.</p>"
