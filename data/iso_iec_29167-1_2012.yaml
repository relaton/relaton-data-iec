abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 defines the architecture for security and file management
    for the ISO/IEC 18000 air interface standards for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices. It provides a common technical specification for security and
    file management for RFID devices that can be used by ISO committees developing
    RFID application standards. ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 specifies architecture for untraceability,
    security services, and file managementas a further optional extension of the air
    interface. Both security and file management are defined in alignment with existing
    air interfaces and ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012 only covers extensions on security and
    file management beyond the scope of the ISO/IEC 18000 air interfaces.ISO/IEC 29167-1:2012
    defines various security features called security mechanisms that can be implemented
    by a tag depending on the application. A tag can support one, a subset, or all
    of the specified security mechanisms. For an interrogator it is possible to get
    information about the security mechanisms that are actually implemented and supported
    by a tag. Moreover, it has been considered that adding new security mechanisms
    remains possible. Besides signaling the presence of certain security services,
    further details of the mechanisms such as utilized encryption algorithm and key
    length also need to be specified and accessible.
