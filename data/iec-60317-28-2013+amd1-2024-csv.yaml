  content: "IEC 60317-28:2013+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of enamelled
    rectangular copper winding wire of class 180 with a sole coating based on polyesterimide
    resin, which may be modified providing it retains the chemical identity of the
    original resin and meets all specified wire requirements. NOTE - A modified resin
    is a resin that has undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives
    to enhance certain performance or application characteristics. The range of nominal
    conductor dimensions covered by this standard is:<br />\r\n- width: min. 2,0 mm
    max. 16,0 mm;<br />\r\n- thickness: min. 0,80 mm max. 5,60 mm. Wires of grade
    1 and grade 2 are included in this specification and apply to the complete range
    of conductors. The specified combinations of width and thickness as well as the
    specified width/thickness ratio are given in IEC 60317-0-2:2013. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1990, Amendment 1:1997 and
    Amendment 2:2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new subclause containing general notes on winding wire, formerly
    a part of the scope;<br />\r\n- revision to references to IEC 60317-0-2:2013 to
    clarify that their application is normative;<br />\r\n- new 3.3, Appearance;<br
    />\r\n- deletion of Clause 22, High temperature failure;<br />\r\n- modification
    to Clause 23, Pin hole test. Keywords: requirements of enamelled rectangular copper
    winding wire, class 180, sole coating based on polyesterimide resin<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThis publication is to be read in conjunction with <a href=\"https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/1347\">IEC
    60317-0-2:2013</a>."
