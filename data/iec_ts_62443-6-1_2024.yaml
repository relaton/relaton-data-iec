abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62443-6-1:2024 specifies the evaluation methodology to support
    interested parties (e.g. during conformity assessment activities) to achieve repeatable
    and reproducible evaluation results against IEC 62443-2-4 requirements. This document
    is intended for first-party, second-party or third-party conformity assessment
    activity, for example by product suppliers, service providers, asset owners and
    conformity assessment bodies.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 62443-2-4 specifies requirements
    for security capabilities of an IACS service provider. These security capabilities
    can be offered as a security program during integration and maintenance of an
    automation solution.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The term “conformity assessment” and the
    terms first-party conformity assessment activity, second-party conformity assessment
    activity and third-party conformity assessment activity are defined in ISO/IEC
    17000."
