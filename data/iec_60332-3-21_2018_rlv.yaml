abstract:
- content: "IEC 60332-3-21:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60332-3-21:2018
    covers category A F/R for methods of test for the assessment of vertical flame
    spread of vertically-mounted bunched wires or cables, under defined conditions.
    This document relates only to power cables of conductor cross-sectional area greater
    than 35 mm2 installed on the test ladder in a spaced configuration on the front
    and rear to achieve a nominal total volume of non-metallic material of 7 l/m of
    test sample. The flame application time is 40 min. This method of mounting is
    intended for special cable designs used in particular installations when required
    in the cable specification. Category A F/R is not intended for general use. The
    test is intended for type approval testing. The requirements for the selection
    of cables for testing are given in Annex A. The flame spread is measured as the
    extent of damage of the cable sample. This procedure can be used to demonstrate
    the cableâ€™s ability to limit flame spread. A recommended performance requirement
    is given in Annex B.^This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2000. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) adjustments have been made to the title, and elsewhere, to
    emphasise the standard is applicable to optical fibre cables as well as metallic
    conductor types;<br />\r\nb) details of the way in which cables are mounted on
    the ladder have been better defined in order to improve repeatability and reproducibility.<br
    />\r\nIt has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide
    104."
