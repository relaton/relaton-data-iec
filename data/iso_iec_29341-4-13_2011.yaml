abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-4-13:2011(E) The RenderingControl service is intended to
    provide control points with the ability to query and/or adjust \nany rendering
    attribute that the device supports. The RenderingControl service enables a control
    point to:<br/> \n- Discover the set of attributes supported by the device.<br/>
    \n- Retrieve the current setting of any supported attribute.<br/> \n- Change the
    setting of (that is: control) any modifiable attribute.<br/> \n- Restore the settings
    defined by a named Preset. This device specification is compliant with the Universal
    Plug and Play Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred
    to herein as RenderingControl. This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-13,
    first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision."
