    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-4-13:2011 The RenderingControl service is intended to provide control points
    with the ability to query and/or adjust any rendering attribute that the device
    supports. The RenderingControl service enables a control point to:<br />\r\n-
    Discover the set of attributes supported by the device.<br />\r\n- Retrieve the
    current setting of any supported attribute.<br />\r\n- Change the setting of (that
    is: control) any modifiable attribute.<br />\r\n- Restore the settings defined
    by a named Preset. This device specification is compliant with the Universal Plug
    and Play Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a device type referred to
    herein as RenderingControl. This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-13,
    first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision."
