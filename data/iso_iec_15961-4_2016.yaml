abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15961-4:2016 provides a set of application commands and their
    associated responses for the following functions:<br />\r\n- to start and stop
    battery assistance;<br />\r\n- to select and de-select a particular sensory function
    supported by the RFID tag;<br />\r\n- to set sensor parameters both initially
    and ongoing;<br />\r\n- to start and stop the sensor monitoring the environment;<br
    />\r\n- to access sensor data;<br />\r\n- to establish the battery status.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 24753 defines the encoding rules for identifying sensors, their
    functions, their delivered measurements, and the processing rules for sensor data.
    As such, it receives commands as defined in ISO/IEC 15961-4:2016 and provides
    the information that is required for the appropriate responses."
