  content: "IEC 62770:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62770:2024 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62770:2013
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 10 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62770:2024 describes specifications and test methods for unused
    natural esters in transformers and similar liquid-immersed electrical equipment
    in which a liquid is required as an insulating and heat transfer medium. The exposure
    of natural ester to air leads to deterioration of the insulating liquid. Use of
    natural esters is therefore restricted to sealed units, or with the conservator
    tank protected from the contact with atmosphere by a membrane or other suitable
    system."
