abstract:
- content: "IEC 61921:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61921:2017
    is applicable to low-voltage AC shunt capacitor banks intended to be used for
    power factor correction purposes, possibly equipped with a built-in switchgear
    and controlgear apparatus capable of connecting to or disconnecting from the mains
    part(s) of the bank with the aim to correct its power factor. Low-voltage power
    factor correction banks if not otherwise indicated hereinafter and where applicable
    comply with the requirements of IEC 61439-1 and IEC 61439-2. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003. It constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition: numerous changes regarding verification methods
    to align with IEC 61439-1; modification of marking; add routine verification of
    rated output; new Annex D with guidance on methods for temperature rise verification;
    update of normative references; general editorial review.<br /><br />\r\nKeywords:
