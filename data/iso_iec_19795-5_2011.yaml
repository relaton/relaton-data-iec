abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 19795-5:2011 specifies a framework for testing and a grading scheme
    for reporting the performance of a biometric system suitable for use in access
    control applications. It also allows for specifying application performance requirements
    in terms of the required performance of the biometric component of the access
    control system. It specifies the environment in which and the means by which testing
    will be performed and how the results will be reported. The grading scheme takes
    a conservative approach, using statistical analysis and confidence intervals to
    support the claim that the device performance is at least as good as the graded
    performance indicates. ISO/IEC 19795-5:2011 addresses conventional access control
    circumstances, and unusual or extreme circumstances are not within its scope.
