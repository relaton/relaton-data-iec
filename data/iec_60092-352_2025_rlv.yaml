abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-352:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60092-352:2025
    provides the basic requirements for the selection, installation and operating
    conditions of electrical cables intended for fixed electrical systems on board
    ships at voltages (U) up to and including Um 18/30 (36) kV, symmetrical category
    cables and fibre optic cables.<br />\r\nThe reference to fixed systems includes
    those that are subjected to vibration (due to the movement of the ship) or movement
    (due to motion of the ship) and not to those that are intended for frequent flexing.<br
    />\r\nCables subject to frequent or continual flexing use, which can withstand
    the mechanical stress and the environment they are exposed to, are detailed in
    other IEC specifications such as IEC 60227 and IEC 60245. Flexible cables are
    frequently used for retractable thrusters, elevators, moving decks, cranes, shore
    connections and other moving applications on board ships.<br />\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2005. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    modification of the part title;<br />\r\nb) complete review of the document and
    establishment of the match with all other standards from the group IEC 60092-350
    to IEC 60092-379;<br />\r\nc) addition of terms and definitions;<br />\r\nd) addition
    of technical requirements for the installation of symmetrical category cables
    with transmission characteristics up to 1 000 MHz;<br />\r\ne) addition of the
    technical requirements for the installation of fibre optic cables;<br />\r\nf)
    addition of technical requirements for the installation of cables for installation
    between areas with and without explosive atmospheres"
