abstract:
- content: Requirements engineering (RE) is an essential process of the systems and
    software engineering life cycles. RE has been established as an ISO/IEC standard
    life cycle process in both ISO/IEC 15288:2008, Systems and software engineering
    — System life cycle processes and ISO/IEC 12207:2008, Systems and software engineering
    — Software life cycle processes.This Technical Report provides guidance on desirable
    capabilities of RE tools. It supplements ISO/IEC 14102:2008, Information technology
    — Guideline for the evaluation and selection of CASE tools, which details a set
    of evaluation criteria for CASE tools without referencing a specific activity
    or service area.
