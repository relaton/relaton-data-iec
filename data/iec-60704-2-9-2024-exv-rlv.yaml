    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60704-2-9:2024 applies to electric hand-held hairdryers for
    household and similar use supplied from mains, which operate with a flow of air.
    These particular requirements can also be applied to analogous electrically operated
    devices such as hairstyling appliances, which produce the airflow by a fan. Helmet-type
    hairdryers are excluded from this document. This document does not apply to hair
    care appliances with radiant heating. For determining and verifying noise emission
    values declared in product specifications, see IEC 60704-3. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Alignment with IEC 60704-1:2021.<br
    />\r\nThis part 2-9 is intended to be used in conjunction with the fourth edition
    of IEC 60704-1:2021: Household and similar electrical appliances - Test code for
    the determination of airborne acoustical noise - Part 1: General requirements."
