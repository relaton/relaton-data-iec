  content: "ISO&#x2F;IEC 21823-3:2021 provides the basic concepts for IoT systems
    semantic interoperability, as described in the facet model of ISO&#x2F;IEC 21823-1,
    including:</br>\r\n– requirements of the core ontologies for semantic interoperability;</br>\r\n–
    best practices and guidance on how to use ontologies and to develop domain-specific
    applications, including the need to allow for extensibility and connection to
    external ontologies;</br>\r\n– cross-domain specification and formalization of
    ontologies to provide harmonized utilization of existing ontologies;</br>\r\n–
    relevant IoT ontologies along with comparative study of the characteristics and
    approaches in terms of modularity, extensibility, reusability, scalability, interoperability
    with upper ontologies, and so on, and;</br>\r\n– use cases and service scenarios
    that exhibit necessities and requirements of semantic interoperability."
