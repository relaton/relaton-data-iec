abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 11581-10:2010 recognizes that icons are more than just symbols
    used on computer screens. Icons are interaction objects used by computer interfaces
    to accomplish various purposes. Icons can be rendered in various forms, including
    graphics, gesture, audio, tactile/haptics, or any combination thereof. This versatility
    in rendition can provide greater accessibility to their underlying functionalities.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    11581-10:2010 provides guidance for developers and designers creating and/or using
    icons and provides a basis for the standardization of icons. It also provides
    a framework for creating future parts of ISO/IEC 11581 and for identifying icon-related
    information to be used in any accompanying icon registries.</p><p>It is important
    that icons are viewed not only as individual renditions with their associated
    functionality, but also that the context in which they are used is considered.
    ISO/IEC 11581-10:2010 gives requirements and recommendations for icons as they
    relate to other rendered elements, to sets of icons and to consistency among these
    symbols.</p>"
