abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 60825-3:2022 gives guidance on the planning and design, set-up
    and conduct of laser displays and shows that make use of high power lasers emitting
    output between 380 nm and 780 nm.<br />\r\nThis document is a code of practice
    for the design, installation, operation and evaluation of the safety of laser
    light shows and displays, and the equipment employed in their production. This
    document is also intended for persons who modify laser display installations or
    equipment.<br />\r\nThe laser power needed to produce visually effective theatrical
    or artistic displays in large spaces such as theatres, arenas, or architectural
    sites is great enough to pose a severe accidental exposure hazard, even when personal
    exposure is very brief. For this reason, IEC TR 60825-14 states that only laser
    products that are Class 1, Class 2 or visible-beam Class 3R should be used for
    demonstration, display or entertainment purposes in unsupervised areas. Only under
    carefully controlled conditions and under the control of a trained experienced
    operator can laser products of higher classes be used for visual entertainment.<br
    />\r\nThis document expands upon the principles considered in IEC TR 60825-14,
    providing specific technical guidance appropriate for the safe use of laser products
    used for the purposes of visual entertainment."
