  content: "IEC 60335-2-40:2022 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-40:2022 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2010+AMD1:2013+AMD2:2016 CSV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-40:2022
    deals with the safety of electric heat pumps, sanitary hot water heat pumps and
    air conditioners, incorporating motor-compressors as well as hydronic fan coils
    units, dehumidifiers (with or without motor-compressors), thermoelectric heat
    pumps and partial units. Their maximum rated voltage being not more than 300 V
    for single phase appliances and 600 V for multi-phase appliances. Appliances not
    intended for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of danger
    to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light
    industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. The appliances referenced
    above can consist of one or more factory-made assemblies. If provided in more
    than one assembly, the separate assemblies are used together, and the requirements
    are based on the use of matched assemblies. This document does not take into account
    refrigerants other than group A1, A2L, A2 and A3 as defined by ISO 817. Flammable
    refrigerants are limited to those of a molar mass of more than or equal to 42
    kg/kmol based on WCF (worst case formulation) as specified in ISO 817. As far
    as practical, this document deals with common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered in normal use and assumes that installation, servicing, decommissioning,
    and disposal are safely handled by competent persons and accidental release of
    refrigerants is avoided. However, it does not prescribe the criteria to ensure
    competence of persons during installation, servicing and disposal. Safety requirements
    during disposal are not specified in this standard. Supplementary heaters, or
    a provision for their separate installation, are within the scope of this standard,
    but only heaters which are designed as a part of the appliance package, the controls
    being incorporated in the appliance. Attention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n-
    for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified, for example, by the national health authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and the national authorities responsible for storage,
    transportation, building constructions and installations.<br />\r\nThis document
    does not apply to<br />\r\n- humidifiers intended for use with heating and cooling
    equipment (IEC 60335-2-88);<br />\r\n- appliances designed exclusively for industrial
    processing;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces the
    sixth edition published in 2018. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Clause 1: added thermoelectric heat pumps
    to the scope and increased maximum rated voltage to 300 V for single phase appliances;<br
    />\r\n- Clause 7: revised requirements for marking on the appliance and packaging,
    including a symbol for minimum floor area and modifying the symbol for flammable
    refrigerants to include the safety group per ISO 817;<br />\r\n- Clause 11 and
    Clause 19: restructured for alignment with Part 1 and added requirements for supplementary
    air heaters;<br />\r\n- Clause 13 and Clause 16: revised requirement for leakage
    current for stationary class I motor-operated appliances;<br />\r\n- Clause 21:
    added requirements for particle foam material and revised requirements for transport
    testing;<br />\r\n- Clause 22: removed limit on the sum of refrigerant charges
    for appliances with multiple refrigerating systems, and revised requirements for
    avoiding ignition sources, leak detection systems, safety shut-off valves, and
    particle foam material;<br />\r\n- Clause 23: added requirements to avoid contact
    between wires and refrigerant piping;<br />\r\n- Clause 24<br />\r\nThe content
    of the corrigendum 1 (2024-10) has been included in this copy."
