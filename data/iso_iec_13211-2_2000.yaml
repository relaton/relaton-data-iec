abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 13211 is designed to promote the</p><p>applicability
    and portability of Prolog modules that contain</p><p>Prolog text complying with
    the requirements of the Programming</p><p>Language Prolog as specified in this
    part of ISO/IEC 13211.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 13211 specifies:</p><p>a) The
    representation of Prolog text that constitutes a Prolog</p><p>module,</p><p>b)
    The constraints that shall be satisfied to prepare Prolog</p><p>modules for execution,
    and</p><p>c) The requirements, restrictions and limits imposed on a</p><p>conforming
    Prolog processor that processes modules.</p><p>This part of ISO/IEC 13211 does
    not specify:</p><p>a) The size or number of Prolog modules that will exceed the</p><p>capacity
    of any specific data processing system or language</p><p>processor, or the actions
    to be taken when the limit is</p><p>exceeded,</p><p>b) The methods of activating
    the Prolog processor or the</p><p>set of commands used to control the environment
    in which</p><p>Prolog modules are prepared for execution,</p><p>c) The mechanisms
    by which Prolog modules are loaded,</p><p>d) The relationship between Prolog modules
    and the</p><p>processor-specific file system.</p><p><strong>1.1 Notes</strong></p><p>Notes
    in this part of ISO/IEC 13211 have no effect on the</p><p>language, Prolog text,
    module text or Prolog processors that are</p><p>defined as conforming to this
    part of ISO/IEC 13211. Reasons</p><p>for including a note include:</p><p>a) Cross
    references to other clauses and subclauses of this</p><p>part of ISO/IEC 13211
    in order to help readers find their</p><p>way around,</p><p>b) Warnings when a
    built-in predicate as defined in this part</p><p>of ISO/IEC 13211 has a different
    meaning in some existing</p><p>implementations.</p>"
