abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63222-1:2021(E), which is a Technical Specification, is intended
    to provide provisions associated to the main use cases regarding recognized engineering
    practices applicable to power quality management in public electric power supply
    networks. It summarizes the operation in power quality management and investigates
    the current standards, for requirement of power quality assessment work, as well
    as to promote the development of power quality management best practices.<br />\r\nThe
    power quality management domain groups use cases and associated power quality
    requirements common to network management, including customer support network
    operation, network and extension planning.<br />\r\nThis document captures possible
    \"common and repeated usage\" of power quality management under the format of
    \"use case\". Use case implementations are given for information purpose only.
    This document derives the common requirement as provisions by further standardization
    activities, in terms of actors interacting with the given system. The interface
    requirement is considered for later standardization activities. The relationship
    of the stakeholders in power quality management, such as network operator, network
    user, etc., are discussed in the document."
