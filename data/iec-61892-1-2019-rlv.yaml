  content: "IEC 61892-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61892-1:2019
    is applicable to electrical installations and equipment in mobile and fixed offshore
    units, including pipeline, pumping or \"pigging\" stations, compressor stations
    and single buoy moorings, used in the offshore petroleum industry for drilling,
    production, accommodation, processing, storage and offloading purposes.<br />\r\nIt
    applies to all installations, whether permanent, temporary, transportable or hand-held,
    to AC installations and DC installations without any voltage level limitation.
    Referenced equipment standards may give voltage level limitations.<br />\r\nThis
    document specifies requirements such as those concerning<br />\r\n– environmental
    conditions,<br />\r\n– power supply characteristics,<br />\r\n– location of electrical
    equipment in units,<br />\r\n– protection against external influences,<br />\r\n–
    protection against electrical shock, and<br />\r\n– ignition source control.<br
    />\r\nThis document gives information and guidance on topics such as<br />\r\n–
    cold climate protection, and<br />\r\n– surface treatment and protective painting
    system.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to<br />\r\n– fixed equipment for
    medical purposes,<br />\r\n– electrical installations of tankers, and<br />\r\n–
    control of ignition sources other than those created by electrical equipment.<br
    />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in
    2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) voltage limitations have been removed;<br />\r\nb) definitions for fixed
    offshore units and mobile offshore units have been included;<br />\r\nc) tables
    for ambient air temperature and relative humidity have been removed, as this information
    will normally be given in owner's/operator's documentation for specific projects;<br
    />\r\nd) the requirement as to ignition source control has been moved from IEC
    61892-7 to this document;<br />\r\ne) tables for voltage characteristics have
    been updated;<br />\r\nf) requirements for a minimum degree of protection for
    equipment have been moved from IEC 61892-2 to this document."
