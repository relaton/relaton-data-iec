abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29109-7:2011 specifies elements of conformance testing methodology,
    test assertions, and test procedures as applicable to ISO/IEC 19794-7. ISO/IEC
    19794-7 defines two data interchange formats for signature/sign time series data,
    one for general use and one compact format for use with smart cards and other
    tokens.  ISO/IEC 29109-7:2011 establishes    test assertions of the structure
    of both signature/sign time series data formats as specified in ISO/IEC 19794-7
    (Type A Level 1 as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1),   test assertions of internal
    consistency by checking the types of values that may be contained within each
    field (Type A Level 2 as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1), and   test assertions on
    the contents of data records in the signature/sign time series data formats as
    specified in ISO/IEC 19794-7 (Type A Level 3 as defined in ISO/IEC 29109-1).     ISO/IEC
    29109-7:2011 does not establish    tests of other characteristics of biometric
    products or other types of testing of biometric products (e.g. acceptance, performance,
    robustness, security), and   tests of conformance of systems that do not produce
    ISO/IEC 19794-7 records.
