abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    17345:2006 specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical characteristics of
    a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-optical Phase Change
    effects to enable data interchange between such disks.<br />\r\nIt specifies two
    types:\r\n\r\n\tType RW (Rewritable) provides for data to be written read and
    erased many times over the recording surfaces of the disk.\r\n\tType WORM (Write
    Once Read Many) provides for data once written to be read a multiplicity of times.
    This type uses a Write Once Read Many times recording material (written marks
    cannot be erased and attempted modifications of the written marks are detectable).
    Multisession (incremental write operations) recording may be performed on Type
    WORM disks."
