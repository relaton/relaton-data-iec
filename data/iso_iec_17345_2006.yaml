abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 17345:2006 specifies the mechanical, physical, and optical
    characteristics of a 130 mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) that employs thermo-optical
    Phase Change effects to enable data interchange between such disks.</p><p>It specifies
    two types:</p><ul><li>Type RW (Rewritable) provides for data to be written read
    and erased many times over the recording surfaces of the disk.</li><li>Type WORM
    (Write Once Read Many) provides for data once written to be read a multiplicity
    of times. This type uses a Write Once Read Many times recording material (written
    marks cannot be erased and attempted modifications of the written marks are detectable).
    Multisession (incremental write operations) recording may be performed on Type
    WORM disks.</li></ul>"
