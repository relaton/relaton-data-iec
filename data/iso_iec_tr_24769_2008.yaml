abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 24769:2008 defines the test methods for determining the conformance
    of 2,4 GHz real time locating system (RTLS) tags with the specifications given
    in the corresponding parts of ISO/IEC 24730-2, but does not apply to the testing
    of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.<br /><br />\r\nThe test
    methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions
    which are implemented, be verified. This may in appropriate circumstances be supplemented
    by further, application specific, functionality criteria that are not available
    to the general case.<br /><br />\r\nThe RTLS tag conformance parameters included
    in this document include the mandatory direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)
    2,4 GHz radio frequency beacon. It also includes the optional on-off keyed, frequency
    shift keyed (OOK/FSK) short range radio frequency link and the optional magnetic
    air interface.<br /><br />\r\nUnless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC
    TR 24769:2008 apply exclusively to RTLS tags defined in ISO/IEC 24730-2."
