abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 24769:2008 defines the test methods for determining the
    conformance of 2,4 GHz real time locating system (RTLS) tags with the specifications
    given in the corresponding parts of ISO/IEC 24730-2, but does not apply to the
    testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The test
    methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions
    which are implemented, be verified. This may in appropriate circumstances be supplemented
    by further, application specific, functionality criteria that are not available
    to the general case.</p><p>The RTLS tag conformance parameters included in this
    document include the mandatory direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) 2,4 GHz
    radio frequency beacon. It also includes the optional on-off keyed, frequency
    shift keyed (OOK/FSK) short range radio frequency link and the optional magnetic
    air interface.</p><p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC TR 24769:2008
    apply exclusively to RTLS tags defined in ISO/IEC 24730-2.</p>"
