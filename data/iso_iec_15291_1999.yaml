abstract:
- content: "<p>The Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) is an interface between
    an Ada environment (as defined by ISO/IEC 8652:1995) and any tool requiring information
    from this environment. An Ada environment includes valuable semantic and syntactic
    information. ASIS is an open and published callable interface which gives CASE
    tool and application developers access to this information. ASIS has been designed
    to be independent of underlying Ada environment implementations, thus supporting
    portability of software engineering tools while relieving tool developers from
    needing to understand the complexities of an Ada environmentâ€™s proprietary internal
    representation.</p><p>Examples of tools that benefit from the ASIS interface include:
    automated code monitors, browsers, call tree tools, code reformators, coding standards
    compliance tools, correctness verifiers, debuggers, dependency tree analysis tools,
    design tools, document generators, metrics tools, quality assessment tools, reverse
    engineering tools, re-engineering tools, safety and security tools, style checkers,
    test tools, timing estimators, and translators.</p><p>This International Standard
    specifies the form and meaning of the ASIS interface to the Ada compilation environment.</p><p>This
    International Standard is applicable to tools and applications needing syntactic
    and semantic information in the Ada compilation environment.</p>"
