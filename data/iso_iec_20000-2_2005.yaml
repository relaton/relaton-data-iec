abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 20000-2:2005 represents an industry consensus on guidance to auditors
    and offers assistance to service providers planning service improvements or to
    be audited against ISO/IEC 20000-1. ISO/IEC 20000-2:2005 is based on BS 15000-2,
    which has been superseded.   Organizations require increasingly advanced facilities
    (at minimum cost) to meet their business needs. With the increasing dependencies
    in support services and the diverse range of technologies available, service providers
    can struggle to maintain high levels of customer service. Working reactively,
    they spend too little time planning, training, reviewing, investigating, and working
    with customers. The result is a failure to adopt structured, proactive working
    practices. Those same service providers are being asked for improved quality,
    lower costs, greater flexibility, and faster response to customers.    In contrast,
    effective service management delivers high levels of customer service and customer
    satisfaction. It also recognizes that services and service management are essential
    to helping organizations generate revenue and be cost-effective. The ISO/IEC 20000
    series enables service providers to understand how to enhance the quality of service
    delivered to their customers, both internal and external.   The ISO/IEC 20000
    series draws a distinction between the best practices of processes, which are
    independent of organizational form or size and organizational names and structures.
    The ISO/IEC 20000 series applies to both large and small service providers, and
    the requirements for best practice service management processes are independent
    of the service provider's organizational form. These service management processes
    deliver the best possible service to meet a customer's business needs within agreed
    resource levels, i.e. service that is professional, cost-effective and with risks
    which are understood and managed.   The variety of terms used for the same process,
    and between processes and functional groups (and job titles) can make the subject
    of service management confusing to the new manager. Understanding the terminology
    is a tangible and significant benefit from ISO/IEC 20000.
