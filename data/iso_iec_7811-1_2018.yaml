abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 7811-1:2018 This document is one of a series of International
    Standards describing the parameters for identification cards as defined in the
    terms and definitions clause and the use of such cards for international interchange.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies requirements for embossed characters on identification
    cards. The embossed characters are intended for transfer of data either by use
    of imprinters or by visual or machine reading. It takes into consideration both
    human and machine aspects and states minimum requirements.<br />\r\nIt is the
    purpose of this document to provide criteria to which cards shall perform. No
    consideration is given within this document to the amount of use, if any, experienced
    by the card prior to test. Failure to conform to specified criteria is negotiated
    between the involved parties.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 10373‑1 specifies the test procedures
    used to check cards against the parameters specified in this document.<br />\r\nNOTE
    1 Numeric values in the SI and/or Imperial measurement system in this document
    may have been rounded off and are consistent with, but not exactly equal to each
    other. Using either system is correct but intermixing or reconverting values can
    result in errors. The original design was made using the Imperial measurement
    system.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Tactile Identifier Mark (TIM) defined by ISO/IEC 7811‑9
    can be located in the name and address area of this document. The layout of embossed
    characters in this area is not intended to interfere with TIM."
