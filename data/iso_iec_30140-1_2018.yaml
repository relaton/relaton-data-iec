abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 30140-1:2018(E) This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 30140 provides a
    general overview of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UWASN). It describes
    their main characteristics in terms of the effects of propagation variability
    and analyses the main differences with respect to terrestrial networks. It further
    identifies the specificities of UWASN and derives some specific and general requirements
    for these networks.
