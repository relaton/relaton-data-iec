  content: "IEC/TR 62905:2018(E) is a Technical Report. Provides general information
    on the assessment of contact current related to human exposure to electric, magnetic
    and electromagnetic fields. The contact currents in this context occur when a
    human body comes into contact with a not electrified conductive object exposed
    to an electric and/or magnetic field at a different electric potential owing to
    electric and/or magnetic induction to the object. This is distinguished from the
    issue of electrical safety where contact with live parts of a conductive object
    is dealt with.<br />\r\nIn reference to the international EMF guidelines, the
    frequency range of contact current covered in this document is direct current
    to 110 MHz, and only steady-state (continuous) contact currents are covered. Transient
    contact currents (spark discharges) which may occur immediately before the contact
    with the object are not covered.<br />\r\nKeywords: Human Exposure Electric Fields,
    Magnetic Fields, Electromagnetic Fields"
