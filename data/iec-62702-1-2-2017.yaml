  content: "IEC 62702-1-2:2017(E) specifies a method of data-quality assurance for
    writable disks which are specified for long-term data storage, and a data migration
    method, which can sustain the recorded data on disks for long-term audio data
    preservation. The writable disks include Blu-ray Disk (BD) Recordable disk and
    BD Rewritable disk.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the physical and logical
    aspects for a standard of audio archives of various storage types which are typically
    used for audio archives in markets.<br />\r\nThe IEC 62702 series consists of:<br
    />\r\n- IEC 62702-1, which specifies the minimum requirements on physical aspects
    of optical disks for digital sound recordings; IEC 62702-1-1 specifies requirements
    for DVD optical disks, IEC 62702-1-2 specifies requirements for BD optical disks.<br
    />\r\n- IEC 62702-2, which specifies the minimum requirements for digitization
    of content, format of digitized content, content information and media inspection."
