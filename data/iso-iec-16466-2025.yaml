    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document specifies methods and metrics for assessing the accuracy and precision of 3D scanned data for use in 3D printing, throughout the full 3D printing lifecycle.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document focuses mainly on 3D scanned data from computed tomography. Computed tomography can acquire information concerning the internal structures, regional density, orientation and/or alignment of scanning objects, as well as their shape and appearance.</span></p>
    <p class="MsoBodyText"><span lang="EN-GB">This document is applicable to the assessment of image-based modelling, segmentation, and 3D models.</span></p>
