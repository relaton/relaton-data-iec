    <p>ISO/IEC 11694-6:2006 is one of a series of standards describing the parameters for optical memory cards and the use of such cards for the storage and interchange of digital data.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 11694 recognizes the existence of different methods of recording and reading information on optical memory cards, the characteristics of which are specific to the recording method employed. ISO/IEC 11694-6:2006 is specific to optical memory cards using the linear recording method and standardizes a method for the use of biometrics on an optical memory card.</p>
