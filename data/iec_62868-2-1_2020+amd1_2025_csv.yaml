abstract:
- content: IEC 62868-2-1:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies safety requirements for semi-integrated
    organic light emitting diode modules operating with an external controlgear connected
    to the mains voltage, and which, in addition, have a control means inside ("semi-integrated")
    for operation under constant voltage, constant current or constant power and have
    a rated voltage up to 120 V ripple free DC or 50 V AC RMS at 50 Hz or 60 Hz.
