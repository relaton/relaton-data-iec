abstract:
- content: ISO/TS 80004-4:2011 gives terms and definitions for materials in the field
    of nanotechnologies where one or more components are nanoscale regions and the
    materials exhibit properties attributable to the presence of those nanoscale regions.
    It is intended to facilitate communications between organizations and individuals
    in industry and those who interact with them. Materials classified as nanostructured
    have an internal or surface structure with a significant fraction of features,
    grains, voids or precipitates in the nanoscale. Articles that contain nano-objects
    or nanostructured materials are not necessarily nanostructured materials themselves.
    ISO/TS 80004-4:2011 includes nanodispersion.
