abstract:
- content: "This part of IEC 61000 provides guidance on principles which can be used
    as the basis for determining the requirements for the connection of unbalanced
    installations (i.e. three-phase installations causing voltage unbalance) to MV,
    HV and EHV public power systems (LV installations are covered in other IEC documents).
    For the purposes of this report, an unbalanced installation means a three-phase
    installation (which may be a load or a generator) that produces voltage unbalance
    on the system. The connection of single-phase installations is not specifically
    addressed, as the connection of such installations is under the control of the
    system operator or owner. The general principles however may be adapted when considering
    the connection of single-phase installations. The primary objective is to provide
    guidance to system operators or owners on engineering practices, which will facilitate
    the provision of adequate service quality for all connected customers. In addressing
    installations, this document is not intended to replace equipment standards for
    emission limits. The report addresses the allocation of the capacity of the system
    to absorb disturbances. It does not address how to mitigate disturbances, nor
    does it address how the capacity of the system can be increased. Since the guidelines
    outlined in this report are necessarily based on certain simplifying assumptions,
    there is no guarantee that this approach will always provide the optimum solution
    for all unbalanced load situations. The recommended approach should be used with
    flexibility and judgment as far as engineering is concerned, when applying the
    given assessment procedures in full or in part. The system operator or owner is
    responsible for specifying requirements for the connection of installations which
    may cause unbalance on the system. The disturbing installation is to be understood
    as the complete customer&#x27;s installation (i.e. including balanced and unbalanced
    parts). Problems related to unbalance fall into two basic categories.\r\n- Unbalanced
    installations that draw negative-sequence currents which produce negative-sequence
    voltages on the supply system. Examples of such installations include arc furnaces
    and traction loads (typically connected to the public network at HV), and three
    phase installations where the individual loads are not balanced (typically connected
    at MV and LV). Negative-sequence voltage superimposed onto the terminal voltage
    of rotating machines can produce additional heat losses. Negative-sequence voltage
    can also cause non-characteristic harmonics (typically positive-sequence 3rd harmonic)
    to be produced by power converters.\r\n- Unbalanced installations connected line-to-neutral
    can also draw zero-sequence currents which can be transferred or not into the
    supply system depending on the type of connection of the coupling transformer.
    The flow of zero-sequence currents in a grounded neutral system causes zero-sequence
    unbalance affecting line-to-neutral voltages. This is not normally controlled
    by setting emission limits, but rather by system design and maintenance. Ungrounded-neutral
    systems and phase-to-phase connected installations are not, however, affected
    by this kind of voltage unbalance. This report gives guidance only for the coordination
    of the negative-sequence type of voltage unbalance between different voltage levels
    in order to meet the compatibility levels at the point of utilisation. No compatibility
    levels are defined for zero-sequence type of voltage unbalance as this is often
    considered as being less relevant to the coordination of unbalance levels compared
    to the first type of voltage unbalance. However, for situations where a non-zero
    impedance exists between neutral and earth with the system still being effectively
    grounded (i.e., where the ratio between zero-sequence, X0 and positive sequence
    reactance X1 is 0 &lt; X0&#x2F;X1 = 3), this type of voltage unbalance can be
    of concern especially when the type of connection of the coupling transformer
    allows zero-sequence path to flow from MV to LV and vice-versa. This Technical
    Report has the status of a basic EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide
    107. The contents of the corrigendum of April 2010 have been included in this
    copy."
