abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23000-16:2018 specifies four formats that are used by parties
    communicating using the Publish/Subscribe (PubSub) communication model for their
    multimedia communication purposes.<br />\r\nThe PubSub parties are: Publisher,
    Subscriber, Match Service Provider (MSP) and Consumer and the formats employed
    are Resource Information (RI), Publication Information (PI), Subscription Information
    (SI) and Notification Information (NI).<br />\r\nISO/IEC 23000-16:2018 specifies
    RI, PI, SI and NI in such a way that typical multimedia communication requirements
    can be supported. The following is a non-exhaustive list of such requirements.<br
    />\r\nThe Publisher can:<br />\r\n- describe the Resource for consumption purposes,<br
    />\r\n- define the contract that will bind the Publisher and a Consumer,<br />\r\n-
    request a device to report use of the Resource,<br />\r\n- describe the Resource
    for distribution purposes,<br />\r\n- define the contract that will bind the Publisher
    and a Match Service Provider (MSP) of a match involving the Publication, and<br
    />\r\n- request the MSP to notify/not to notify a list of users.<br />\r\nThe
    Subscriber can:<br />\r\n- query the Resource,<br />\r\n- define the contract
    that will bind the Subscriber and a Match Service Provider (MSP), and<br />\r\n-
    request the MSP to notify/not to notify a list of users of a match involving the
    Subscription.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 23000-16:2018 does not specify the protocols used
    to carry these payloads."
