abstract:
- content: "IEC 60670-24:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60670-24:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60670-1:2024.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60670-24:2024 applies to enclosures and
    parts of them for housing protective devices and other power dissipating electrical
    equipment intended to be used with a rated voltage not exceeding 400 V and a total
    incoming load current not exceeding 125 A for household and similar fixed electrical
    installations. These enclosures are intended to be installed in locations where
    unskilled persons have access. They are intended to be equipped with electrical
    equipment by skilled persons (installers). These enclosures are intended to be
    installed where the prospective short circuit current does not exceed 10 kA unless
    they are protected by current limiting protective devices with a cut-off current
    not exceeding 17 kA. Enclosures complying with this document are suitable for
    use at ambient temperature not normally exceeding 40 °C, but their average temperature
    over a period of 24 h does not exceed 35 °C, with a lower limit of the ambient
    air temperature of −5 °C. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of requirements for protection against
    electric shock in Clause 10;<br />\r\nb) addition of requirements for functional
    earthing in 11.101;<br />\r\nc) revision of the requirements for fixing of flush
    type and semi-flush type enclosures in 12.12;<br />\r\nd) revision of the requirements
    for resistance of insulating material to abnormal heat and to fire in Clause 18;<br
    />\r\ne) addition of calculations to take into account the power loss of electronic
    devices in Clause AA.6;<br />\r\nf) addition of tests and requirements for enclosures
    exposed to direct sunlight with the related Annex CC;<br />\r\ng) addition of
    tests and requirements for enclosures with separate area to accommodate multimedia-equipment
    with the related Annex DD;<br />\r\nh) addition of tests and requirements for
    enclosures used with connected devices or equipment with the related Annex EE."
