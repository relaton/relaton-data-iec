  content: IEC 62899-101:2019(E) defines terms used in the field of printed electronics,
    addressing topics including, but not limited to, materials, printing processes,
    and print characterization. It focuses on terms that are of particular importance
    to printed devices. Therefore, terms that are already defined in relation to conventional
    electronics materials, processes, devices, components or systems that can be used
    in the field of printed electronics without alteration are not included in this
    document. Similarly, established terms and definitions in relation to printing
    technology that apply to the field of printed electronics are not included.
