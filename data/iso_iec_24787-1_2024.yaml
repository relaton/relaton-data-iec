abstract:
- content: "This document provides requirements and general principles and specifications
    for a biometric comparison methodology suitable for the on-card environment.<br
    />\r\nThis document establishes<br />\r\n- architectures of biometric comparison
    using an ICC,<br />\r\n- on-card biometric comparison, both in sensor-off-card
    systems and as part of biometric system-on-card, and<br />\r\n- security policies
    for on-card biometric comparison.<br />\r\nThis document does not establish<br
    />\r\n- requirements for off-card biometric comparison,<br />\r\n- requirements
    for biometric system-on-card (defined in the ISO/IEC 17839 series),<br />\r\n-
    work-sharing on-card biometric comparison (defined in ISO/IEC 24787-2), or<br
    />\r\n- modality-specific requirements for storage and comparison."
