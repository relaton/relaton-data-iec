  content: "IEC 62561-3:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62561-3:2023
    specifies the requirements and tests for isolating spark gaps (ISGs) for lightning
    protection systems. ISGs can be used to indirectly bond a lightning protection
    system to other nearby metalwork where a direct bond is not permissible for functional
    reasons. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition, published
    in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition.<br
    />\r\na) alignment with the latest edition of ISO 22479 relating to humid sulphurous
    atmosphere treatment;<br />\r\nb) addition of a new normative Annex D for the
    applicability of previous tests."
