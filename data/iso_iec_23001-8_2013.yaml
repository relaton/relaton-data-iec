abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23001-8:2013 defines various code points and fields that establish
    properties of a video or audio stream that are independent of the compression
    encoding and bit rate. These properties may describe the appropriate interpretation
    of decoded video or audio data or may, similarly, describe the characteristics
    of such signals before the signal is compressed by an encoder that is suitable
    for compressing such an input signal.</p>"
