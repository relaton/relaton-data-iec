abstract:
- content: "<p><strong>1.1</strong>This<strong>International Standard</strong>establishes<strong>requirements</strong>for
    certifying an assessment that an Ada language</p><p><strong>processor conforms</strong>to
    the<strong>requirements</strong>of the Ada language<strong>standard</strong>,
    ISO/IEC 8652. It places<strong>requirements</strong></p><p>on the<strong>organization</strong>that
    performs the assessment, the assessment procedures, and the<strong>test suite</strong>used
    in the</p><p>assessment. Finally, it places<strong>requirements</strong>on the
    form for the<strong>certificate of conformity</strong>.</p><p><strong>1.2</strong>This<strong>International
    Standard</strong>concerns only the<strong>assessment of conformity</strong>to
    the language<strong>requirements</strong>of</p><p>ISO/IEC 8652. It does not concern
    the assessment of any other characteristics of a language<strong>processor</strong>or
    of the</p><p>construction process used by the<strong>manufacturer</strong>of the
    language<strong>processor</strong>.</p><p>NOTE In the sense of [ISO/IEC Guide
    23], the Ada language<strong>standard</strong>, ISO/IEC 8652, is to be regarded
    as a standard for</p><p>a specific property rather than a comprehensive product
    standard.</p><p><strong>1.3</strong>This<strong>International Standard</strong>is
    intended to be primarily suitable for use by a<strong>third party authority</strong>although</p><p>portions
    of it may also be applied by a supplier (first party) or by a user or purchaser
    (second party).</p><p><strong>1.4</strong>An Ada language<strong>processor</strong>may
    be claimed to<strong>conform</strong>to the<strong>requirements</strong>of ISO/IEC
    8652 regardless of</p><p>the application of this<strong>International Standard</strong>.
    This<strong>International Standard</strong>prescribes the method for obtaining
    a</p><p><strong>certification</strong>that an Ada language processor<strong>conforms</strong>to
    ISO/IEC 8652. Customers desiring to acquire a</p><p>language<strong>processor</strong>certified
    as<strong>conforming</strong>should explicitly require that<strong>certification</strong>by
    citing this<strong>International</strong></p><p><strong>Standard</strong>.</p><p><strong>1.5
    Certification</strong>should not be construed as guaranteeing that the certified
    product is free of<strong>non-conformities</strong>or</p><p>defects; it only certifies
    that no evidence of<strong>non-conformity</strong>was found during the<strong>certification</strong>process.</p>"
