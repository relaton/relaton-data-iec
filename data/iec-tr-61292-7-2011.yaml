  content: IEC/TR 61292-7:2011(E) applies to optical amplifiers (OAs) using active
    fibres and waveguides, containing rare-earth dopants, currently commercially available.
    It provides guidance on crosstalk caused by the four-wave mixing (FWM) effect.
    The object of this technical report is to provide introductory information for
    understanding of the crosstalk issue raised by the FWM effect.
