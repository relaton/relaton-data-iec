abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the characteristics of a 130
    mm optical disk cartridge (ODC) of Type WORM (Write</p><p>Once Read Many) with
    a capacity of 5,2 Gbytes. Type WORM ODCs use writing effects that are inherently
    irreversible.</p><p>Written marks cannot be erased and attempted modification
    of the written marks are detectable.</p><p>This International Standard specifies</p><p>_
    the conditions for conformance testing and the Reference Drive;</p><p>_ the environments
    in which the cartridges are to be operated and stored;</p><p>_ the mechanical,
    physical and dimensional characteristics of the cartridge, so as to provide mechanical
    interchange ability</p><p>between data processing systems;</p><p>_ the format
    of the information on the disk, both embossed and user-written, including the
    physical disposition of the tracks</p><p>and sectors, the error correction codes,
    the modulation methods used;</p><p>_ the characteristics of the embossed information
    on the disk;</p><p>_ the recording characteristics of the disk, enabling processing
    systems to write data onto the disk;</p><p>_ the minimum quality of user-written
    data on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read data from the disk.</p><p>This
    International Standard provides for interchange between optical disk drives. Together
    with a standard for volume and file</p><p>structure it provides for full data
    interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
