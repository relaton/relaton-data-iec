  content: Covers 8 way connectors, up to 4 pairs, to be used up to 600 MHz, when
    used with an appropriate cable. These cables are specified in the IEC 61156 series
    and used in cabling systems specified in ISO/IEC 11801. The connectors are backward
    compatible with the already defined IEC 60603-7-X connectors. The connectors are
    interoperable with the already defined IEC 60603-7-X connectors.
