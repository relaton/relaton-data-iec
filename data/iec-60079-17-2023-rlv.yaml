  content: "IEC 60079-17:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60079-17:2023
    applies to users and covers only those factors directly related to the inspection
    and maintenance of electrical installations specifically designed for hazardous
    areas, where the hazard is caused by explosive atmospheres.<br />\r\nIt does not
    include:<br />\r\n- other fundamental installation and inspection requirements
    for electrical installations;<br />\r\n- the verification of electrical equipment;<br
    />\r\n- protection or ventilation of rooms;<br />\r\n- gas detection systems;<br
    />\r\n- the repair, overhaul and reclamation of explosion protected equipment
    (see IEC 60079-19).<br />\r\nWhile this document does not include inspection of
    safety devices such as used in ventilated rooms (see IEC 60079-13), it does include
    the requirements for inspection and maintenance of individual items of equipment
    that will be part of such systems, for example motors or sensors. This document
    supplements the requirements for inspection and testing in non-hazardous areas
    in IEC 60364-6. This document is intended to be applied where there is a risk
    due to the potential presence of explosive gas or dust mixtures with air or combustible
    dust layers under normal atmospheric conditions. It does not apply to:<br />\r\n-
    underground mining areas,<br />\r\n- dusts of explosives,<br />\r\n- pyrophoric
    substances.<br />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition
    published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision."
