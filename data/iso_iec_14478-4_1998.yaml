abstract:
- content: '<p>This part of ISO/IEC 14478 describes a set of Object types and non-Object
    types to provide the construction of, presentation of, and the interaction with
    Multimedia information. The multimedia information tan be graphics, Video, audio,
    or other types of presentable media. This information tan be enhanced by time
    aspects. Throughout this document this part of ISO/IEC 14478 will also be referred
    to as "Modelling, Rendering and Interaction", and abbreviated as MRI. The Modelling,
    Rendering and Interaction Component constitutes a framework of?Middleware'', System
    Software components lying between the generic operating System and computing environment,
    and a specific application operating as a client of the Services and type definitions
    provided by this component. It provides a framework over the foundation objects
    and multimedia Systems Services defined in other Parts of the international Standard
    for the development of a distributed and heterogeneous network of devices for
    creating multimedia models, rendering these models, and interacting with this
    process.</p><p>The Modelling, Rendering and Interaction Component encompasses
    the following characteristics:</p><p>a) Provision of a hierarchy of multimedia
    primitives as an abstract framework for describing the capabilities of modelling
    and rendering devices, and for enabling their interoperation;</p><p>b) within
    the primitive hierarchy, specific Provision for describing the temporal structure
    of multimedia data through the stepwise construction of structured primitives
    from component data;</p><p>c) Provision of abstract types for modelers, renderers
    and other supporting devices, enabling the integration of such devices or any
    future subtypes representing real Software or hardware, into a processing network
    of such devices;</p><p>d) provision of an Object type to map synchronization requirements
    expressed within multimedia primitives into control of the stream and synchronization
    mechanisms provided by ISO/IEC 14478-2 and ISO/IEC 14478-3.</p><p>The Modelling,
    Rendering and Interaction Component relies on the Object types and Services defined
    in PREMO Part 2: Foundation Components (ISO/IEC 1447%2), and PREMO Part 3: Multimedia
    Systems Services (ISO/IEC 14478-3).</p>'
