abstract:
- content: "IEC 61914:2021 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61914:2021 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61914:2015
    edition 2.0. Futhermore, comments from IEC SC 23A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61914:2021 specifies
    requirements and tests for cable cleats used for securing cables in electrical
    installations and for intermediate restraints used for holding cables together
    in formation in electrical installations. Cable cleats provide resistance to electromechanical
    forces where declared. This document includes cable cleats that rely on a mounting
    surface specified by the manufacturer for axial and/or lateral retention of cables.<br
    />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in
    2015. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:\r\n\r\n\trequirements
    for mandrels used in testing rationalised and detailed in the general test requirements
    (Clause 5);\r\n\tdefinition of liner added and test requirements where liners
    and other optional parts are used;\r\n\tdefinitions for LV, MV and HV cables added
    and test requirements where MV & HV cable are used;\r\n\tnew corrosion resistance
    classes for plated products added;\r\n\tnew requirements and test for durability
    and legibility of markings added;\r\n\tnew test requirements for axial load testing
    of cleats for more than one cable added;\r\n\tlateral load test requirements for
    intermediate restraints added."
