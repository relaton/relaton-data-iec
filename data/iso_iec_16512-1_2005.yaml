abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 16512-1:2005 addresses the basic concepts needed to specify RMCP
    for relayed multicast. It defines the related terminology and proposes a framework
    for the future development of RMCP. The framework covers network topology including
    network entities and relationships between them, service scenarios, basic operations,
    and message encoding rules. RMCP is a protocol which is used to realize a relayed
    multicast data transport scheme. Differently from the conventional IP multicast,
    RMCP can configure a relayed multicast path that multicast traffic flows by using
    intermediate end-hosts. RMCP can be applied to the current unicast-based Internet
    where IP multicast has not been deployed completely without any modifications.
