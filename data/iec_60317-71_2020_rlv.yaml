abstract:
- content: "IEC 60317-71:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60317-71:2020 specifies
    the requirements of polyester glass-fibre wound resin/varnish impregnated, bare,
    grade 1 or grade 2 enamelled round copper winding wire, temperature index 180.
    NOTE For this type of wire, the heat shock test is inappropriate and therefore
    a heat shock temperature cannot be established. Consequently, a class based on
    the requirements for temperature index and heat shock temperature cannot be specified.
    The nominal conductor diameters are specified in IEC 60317-0-10:2017, Clause 4.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2017.
    The document 55/1767/CDV, circulated to the National Committees as Amendment 1,
    led to the publication of this new edition. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    modification of the title;<br />\r\n- revision to the Scope;<br />\r\n- revision
    to 3.2.2.</p>"
