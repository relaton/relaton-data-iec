abstract:
- content: "IEC 62149-4:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62149-4:2022
    defines performance specifications for 1 300 nm fibre optic transceiver modules
    used for the ISO/IEC/IEEE 8802-3 Gigabit Ethernet application. This document contains
    definitions for product performance requirements as well as a series of tests
    and measurements, for which clearly defined conditions, severities and pass/fail
    criteria are provided. The tests are intended to be run on a \"once-off\" basis
    to prove any product’s ability to satisfy the performance standard’s requirements.
    A product that has been shown to meet all the requirements of a performance standard
    can be declared as complying with the performance standard but will then be controlled
    by a quality assurance/quality conformance program. This third edition cancels
    and replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the normative references
    are updated;<br />\r\n- the condition \"for short periods\" in 4.1 is removed;<br
    />\r\n- the absolute limiting rating for soldering temperature in Table 1 is modified;<br
    />\r\n- the maximal optical output power (multimode fibre) in Table 4 is increased
    from −3,5 dBm to −3 dBm, to align value with the referenced document;<br />\r\n-
    a note is added to Table 7 to clarify that out-of-specification products are not
    allowed to pass the performance tests."
