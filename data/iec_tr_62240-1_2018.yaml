abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC TR 62240-1:2018 is available as IEC TR 62240-1:2018 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    TR 62240-1:2018 is a technical report, which provides information when using semiconductor
    devices in wider temperature ranges than those specified by the device manufacturer.
    The uprating solutions described herein are considered exceptions, when no reasonable
    alternatives are available; otherwise devices are utilized within the manufacturers’
    specifications. This document describes the methods and processes for implementing
    this special case of thermal uprating. All of the elements of these methods and
    processes employ existing, commonly used best engineering practices. No new or
    unique engineering knowledge is needed to follow these processes, only a rigorous
    application of the overall approach. The terms “uprating” and “thermal uprating”
    are being used increasingly in avionics industry discussions and meetings, and
    clear definitions are included in the present IEC Technical Report. They were
    coined as shorthand references to a special case of methods commonly used in selecting
    electronic components for circuit design. This new edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2013 and includes a revised wording for subclause
    4.1 (Introduction to selection provisions) and the associated flowchart."
