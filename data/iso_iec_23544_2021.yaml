abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies application platform energy effectiveness (APEE)
    as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) which quantifies the energy effectiveness
    of an application platform for an IT service in data centres. This KPI evaluates
    the energy consumption of an application platform prior to deployment. The purpose
    of this KPI is to measure the energy effectiveness of a set of target IT equipment,
    operating systems and middleware, to enable the selection of an energy effective
    IT stack.</p><p>This document specifies a formula for calculating APEE and definitions
    of components of the formula.</p><p>This document specifies a measurement method
    for assessing and reporting the energy effectiveness of an application platform.</p><p>This
    document also specifies requirements for benchmarks to be used for APEE and requirements
    for reporting.</p><p>The following topics are outside of the scope of this document:</p><p>1)
    KPIs intended to solely evaluate the energy effectiveness of target IT equipment
    hardware,</p><p>2) energy effectiveness of data centre facilities.</p>"
