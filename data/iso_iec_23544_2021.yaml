abstract:
- content: "This document specifies application platform energy effectiveness (APEE)
    as a Key Performance Indicator (KPI) which quantifies the energy effectiveness
    of an application platform for an IT service in data centres. This KPI evaluates
    the energy consumption of an application platform prior to deployment. The purpose
    of this KPI is to measure the energy effectiveness of a set of target IT equipment,
    operating systems and middleware, to enable the selection of an energy effective
    IT stack.<br />\r\nThis document specifies a formula for calculating APEE and
    definitions of components of the formula.<br />\r\nThis document specifies a measurement
    method for assessing and reporting the energy effectiveness of an application
    platform.<br />\r\nThis document also specifies requirements for benchmarks to
    be used for APEE and requirements for reporting.<br />\r\nThe following topics
    are outside of the scope of this document:<br />\r\n1) KPIs intended to solely
    evaluate the energy effectiveness of target IT equipment hardware,<br />\r\n2)
    energy effectiveness of data centre facilities."
