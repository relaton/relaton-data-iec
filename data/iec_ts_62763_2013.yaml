abstract:
- content: IEC/TS 62763:2013(E) describes the pilot wire function designed as a control
    mechanism for the supply of electrical energy to electric vehicles, principally
    for the charging of the traction batteries of the vehicle. It concerns all charging
    systems that ensure the pilot function with a pilot wire circuit with PWM for
    mode 2, mode 3 and mode 4 charging as described in the IEC 61851 series.
