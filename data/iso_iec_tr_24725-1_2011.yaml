abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 24725-1:2011 provides a framework and objectives to assist
    in the development of profiles and platform and media bundles for information
    technology supporting learning, education, and training. These profiles and bundles
    will define conforming subsets or combinations of base standards used to provide
    specific functions in information technology for learning, education, and training
    (ITLET).<br /><br />\r\nIt also provides a proposed architecture that can be used
    to further the development of profiles and platform and media bundle combinations
    that are used to accomplish a specific function or purpose. This development work
    will involve the identification of standards, together with appropriate classes,
    conforming subsets, options and parameters, which are necessary to accomplish
    identified functions or to support a class of applications for learners within
    various information technology environments."
