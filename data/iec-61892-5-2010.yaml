It applies to all installations, whether permanent, temporary, transportable or hand-held, to a.c. installations up to and including 35 000 V and d.c. installations up to and including 1500 V.(a.c. and d.c. voltages are nominal values). This edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2000. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />
    a) the requirement to d.c. generators has been deleted;<br />
