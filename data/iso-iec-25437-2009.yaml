    <p>ISO/IEC 25437:2009 specifies Web Services (in WSDL) and a SOAP binding for the Application Session Services defined in ISO/IEC 22534. The Application Session Services allow Applications to create and maintain a relationship with Servers termed Application Session. The Web services specified herein allow Service Requesters (Applications in ISO/IEC 22534) and Service Providers (Servers in ISO/IEC 22534) to create and maintain such Application Sessions. </p>
    <p>It builds upon and imports the XML schema definitions from ISO/IEC 22534. The method of making the WSDL description of the specified services available to Service Provider and Requester is out of the scope of ISO/IEC 25437:2009.</p>
    <p>The ApplicationSessionTerminated operation of ISO/IEC 25437:2009 is an outbound asynchronous event notification that Service Requesters receive from the Service Provider. Service Requester may also receive the event notification from web services, e.g. ECMA-348, that use ISO/IEC 25437:2009 for session management. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 25437:2009 specifies the event subscription and notification behaviors supported by the two defined Options. Additionally it</p>
    <ul>
    <li>specifies the event subscription mechanism using WS-Eventing,</li>
    <li>specifies the event subscription mechanism using WS-BaseNotification,</li>
    <li>specifies the asynchronous subscription response Option for the two event subscription mechanisms,</li>
    <li>shows an example WS-Session WSDL binding with SOAP/HTTP,</li>
    <li>lists SOAP XML Templates for ISO/IEC 22534 messages,</li>
    <li>lists some SOAP XML Templates for WS-Eventing messages,</li>
    <li>lists some SOAP XML Templates for WS-BaseNotification messages, and</li>
    <li>provides a summary of changes from the previous edition (ISO/IEC 24537:2006).</li>
    </ul>
