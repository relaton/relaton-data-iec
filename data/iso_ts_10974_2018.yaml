abstract:
- content: "ISO/TS 10974:2018 is applicable to implantable parts of active implantable
    medical devices (AIMDs) intended to be used in patients who undergo a magnetic
    resonance scan in 1,5 T, cylindrical (circular or elliptical cross-section) bore,
    whole body MR scanners operating at approximately 64 MHz with whole body coil
    excitation.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Requirements for non-implantable parts are outside
    the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThe tests that are specified in this document
    are type tests that characterize interactions with the magnetic and electromagnetic
    fields associated with an MR scanner. The tests can be used to demonstrate device
    operation according to its MR Conditional labelling. The tests are not intended
    to be used for the routine testing of manufactured products.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Modification
    of these tests for particular device types is left to particular product committees.<br
    />\r\nNOTE 3 Other interested parties, such as device manufacturers, regulatory
    agencies, and particular product committees, are responsible for setting specific
    compliance criteria and determining risk.<br />\r\nNOTE 4 Safety requirements
    for MR scanners can be found in IEC 60601‑2‑33.<br />\r\nNOTE 5 The scope is limited
    to AIMDs that do not use sensing functions or to AIMDs that are programmed not
    to use sensing functions to affect therapy delivery during an MR scan."
