  content: "IEC TR 63161:2022 can be used where a risk assessment according to ISO
    12100 has been conducted for a machine or process plant and where a safety related
    control function has been selected for implementation as a protective measure
    against specified hazards. This document describes an example basic logical rationale
    to assign a safety integrity requirement to the selected function.<br />\r\nThe
    description is generic and as far as reasonably possible independent from any
    specific tool or method that can be used for assignment of a safety integrity
    requirement. The requirement can be expressed as a safety integrity level (SIL),
    or performance level (PL).<br />\r\nAn example basic rationale is described that
    is embodied by such methods and tools, as far as they follow a risk based quantitative
    approach.<br />\r\nConversely, the logic described in this document can be used
    as a reference for assessing specific methods or tools for safety integrity assignment.
    This can clarify how far the respective tool/method is following a risk based
    quantitative approach, and where deviations from that approach are imposed by
    other considerations. In real applications, the quantitative risk based approach
    can be modified or overridden by other considerations in many cases and for good
    reasons. It is not within the scope of this document to discuss or evaluate such
    reasons. Usually the reasons for deviations from a given tool or method from a
    quantitative logic are provided, so that this can be discussed in the proper frame.<br
    />\r\nExamples for such analyses are provided for common assignment tools in the
    format of risk graphs and risk matrices.<br />\r\nThis document can be used for
    safety related control functions in all modes of application: continuous mode,
    high demand mode and low demand mode of application."
