abstract:
- content: IEC PAS 62746-10-1:2014-02(en), originally designated as OpenADR 2.0b profile
    specification, is a flexible data model to facilitate common information exchange
    between electricity service providers, aggregators, and end users. The concept
    of an open specification is intended to allow anyone to implement the two-way
    signalling systems, providing the servers, which publish information to the automated
    clients, which subscribe the information. This OpenADR 2.0 profile specification
    covers the signalling data models and includes information related to specific
    DR (Demand Response) electric reduction or shifting strategies, which are taken
    at the facility. The PDF version of the standard is accompanied by Profile B Schema
    files.
