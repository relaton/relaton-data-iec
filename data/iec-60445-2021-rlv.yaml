  content: "IEC 60445:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60445:2021
    applies to the identification and marking of terminals of electrical equipment
    such as resistors, fuses, relays, contactors, transformers, rotating machines
    and, wherever applicable, to combinations of such equipment (e.g. assemblies),
    and also applies to the identification of terminations of certain designated conductors.
    It also provides general rules for the use of certain colours or alphanumeric
    notations to identify conductors with the aim of avoiding ambiguity and ensuring
    safe operation. These conductor colours or alphanumeric notations are intended
    to be applied in cables or cores, busbars, electrical equipment and installations.
    This basic safety publication is primarily intended for use by technical committees
    in the preparation of standards in accordance with the principles laid down in
    IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. It has the status of a basic safety publication
    in accordance with IEC Guide 104.<br />\r\nIEC 60445:2021 cancels and replaces
    the sixth edition published in 2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the definitions have been aligned with IEC
    60050-195:2021 and IEC 60050-826;<br />\r\nb) the provisions for colour to be
    used for identification of certain designated conductors are made requirements
    and not only recommendations;<br />\r\nc) introduction of a new subclause on marking
    of protective terminals for multiple power supply inputs on equipment."
