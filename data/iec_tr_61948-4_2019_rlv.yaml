abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61948-4:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 61948-4:2019
    covers the routine testing of radionuclide calibrators used in nuclear medicine.
    Such devices utilise ionisation chambers of the well type and a direct readout
    in units of activity. Requirements and specific methods to determine performance
    parameters are described in IEC 61303. These methods are primarily designed for
    acceptance testing. IEC TR 61948-4:2019 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2006. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical change with respect to the previous
    edition: the test method to determine system linearity has been updated to reflect
    the technical developments of radionuclide calibrators."
