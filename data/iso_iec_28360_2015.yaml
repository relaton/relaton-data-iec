abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 28360:2015 specifies methods to determine chemical emission rates
    of Analyte from ICT & CE equipment during intended operation in an Emission Test
    Chamber (ETC).<p>The methods comprise preparation, sampling (or monitoring) in
    a controlled ETC, storage and analysis, calculation and reporting of emission
    rates.</p><p>This International Standard includes specific methods for equipment
    using consumables, such as printers, and equipment not using consumables, such
    as monitors and PC's. Annex A specifies monochrome and colour print patterns for
    use in the operating phase of EUT using consumables (e.g. paper).</p><p>Examples
    of EUT that do not use consumables are:</p><p>· Monitors and TV sets (CRT, Plasma,
    LCD, Rear projector, Beamer).</p><p>· Video (VCR, DVD Player/Recorder, Camcorder).</p><p>·
    SAT Receiver (Set-Top Box).</p><p>· Audio units (CD Player/Recorder, Home theatre
    Systems, Audio Home Systems, Micro-/Mini, Midi Systems, Amplifier, Receiver).</p><p>·
    Portable Audio (CD Player, MP 3 Player, Radio recorder, Clock radio etc).</p><p>·
    Computer (desktop, tower, server), portable computers (Notebooks).</p><p>Emission
    rates from EUT using consumables may also be determined according to additional
    requirements identified by "RAL-UZ 171 Option".</p><p>Calculations use the generalised
    model and approximations thereof as developed in Annex C.</p><p>The emission rates
    determined with this method may be used to compare equipment in the same class.</p><p>Predictions
    of "real indoor"<em>concentrations</em> from the determined<em>emission</em><em>rates</em>
    are outside the scope of this International Standard.</p>
