abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62001-4:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TR 62001:2021,
    which is a Technical Report, provides guidance on the basic data of AC side filters
    for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems and their components such as ratings,
    power losses, design issues and special applications, protection, seismic requirements,
    equipment design and test parameters.<br />\r\nThis document covers AC side filtering
    for the frequency range of interest in terms of harmonic distortion and audible
    frequency disturbances. It excludes filters designed to be effective in the power
    line carrier (PLC) and radio interference spectra. It concerns the conventional
    AC filter technology and LCC (line-commutated converter) HVDC but much of this
    applies to any filter equipment for VSC (voltage sourced converter) HVDC. This
    edition includes the following significant technical change with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- general updating of the document to reflect changes
    in practice;<br />\r\n- Annex A deleted as its content is covered by IEC 61803."
