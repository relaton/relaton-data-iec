abstract:
- content: "IEC 62024-2:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62024-2:2020 specifies the
    measuring methods of the rated direct current limits for small inductors. Standardized
    measuring methods for the determination of ratings enable users to accurately
    compare the current ratings given in various manufacturersâ€™ data books. This document
    is applicable to leaded and surface mount inductors with dimensions according
    to IEC 62025-1 and generally with rated current less than 22 A, although inductors
    with rated current greater than 22 A are available that fall within the dimension
    restrictions of this document (no larger than a 12 mm x 12 mm footprint approximately).
    These inductors are typically used in DC-to-DC converters built on PCBs, for electric
    and telecommunication equipment, and small size switching power supply units.
    The measuring methods are defined by the saturation and temperature rise limitations
    induced solely by direct current. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- addition of
    Table 2 and Figure 2 b).</p>"
