abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies carbon usage effectiveness (CUE) as a key performance
    indicator (KPI) for quantifying the CO<sub>2</sub> emissions of a data centre
    during the use phase of the data centre life cycle.</p><p>CUE is a simple method
    for reporting the CO<sub>2</sub> intensity of the data centre operating. By reporting
    CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, it is possible to present the data centre's contribution
    to climate change (enhanced greenhouse effect).</p><p>This document:</p><p>a)
    defines the CUE of a data centre;</p><p>b) introduces CUE measurement categories;</p><p>c)
    describes the relationship of this KPI to a data centreâ€™s infrastructure, information
    technology equipment and information technology operations;</p><p>d) defines the
    measurement, the calculation and the reporting of the parameter; and</p><p>e)
    provides information on the correct interpretation of the CUE.</p>"
