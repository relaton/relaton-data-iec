abstract:
- content: "IEC 61400-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 61400-1:2019 specifies essential
    design requirements to ensure the structural integrity of wind turbines. Its purpose
    is to provide an appropriate level of protection against damage from all hazards
    during the planned lifetime. This document is concerned with all subsystems of
    wind turbines such as control and protection functions, internal electrical systems,
    mechanical systems and support structures. This document applies to wind turbines
    of all sizes. For small wind turbines, IEC 61400-2 can be applied. IEC 61400-3-1
    provides additional requirements to offshore wind turbine installations. This
    document is intended to be used together with the appropriate IEC and ISO standards
    mentioned in Clause 2. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) general update and clarification
    of references and requirements;<br />\r\nb) extension of wind turbine classes
    to allow for tropical cyclones and high turbulence;<br />\r\nc) Weibull distribution
    of turbulence standard deviation for normal turbulence model (NTM);<br />\r\nd)
    updated design load cases (DLCs), in particular DLC 2.1 and 2.2;<br />\r\ne) revision
    of partial safety factor specifications<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum
    1 (2019-09) and Interpretation sheet 1 (2025-02) have been included in this copy.</p>"
