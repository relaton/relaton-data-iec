abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008 provides a general numerical approach,
    consistent with the broad principles of the<em>Guide to the expression of uncertainty
    in measurement (GUM)</em>, for carrying out the calculations required as part
    of an evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The approach applies to arbitrary
    models having a single output quantity where the input quantities are characterized
    by any specified probability density functions (PDFs).<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008 is primarily concerned with the expression of uncertainty
    in the measurement of a well-defined physical quantity—the measurand—that can
    be characterized by an essentially unique value. It provides guidance in situations
    where the conditions for the GUM uncertainty frameworkare not fulfilled, or it
    is unclear whether they are fulfilled. It can be used when it is difficult to
    apply the GUM uncertainty framework, because of the complexity of the model, for
    example. Guidance is given in a form suitable for computer implementation.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008 can be used to provide (a representation
    of) the PDF for the output quantity from which (a) an estimate of the output quantity,
    (b) the standard uncertainty associated with this estimate, and (c) a coverage
    interval for that quantity, corresponding to a specified coverage probability,
    can be obtained.<br /><br />\r\nFor a prescribed coverage probability, it can
    be used to provide any required coverage interval, including the probabilistically
    symmetric coverage interval and the shortest coverage interval.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008 applies to input quantities that are independent, where
    each such quantity is assigned an appropriate PDF, or not independent, i.e. when
    some or all of these quantities are assigned a joint PDF.<br /><br />\r\nDetailed
    examples illustrate the guidance provided."
