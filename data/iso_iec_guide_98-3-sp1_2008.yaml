abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008 provides a general numerical approach,
    consistent with the broad principles of the<em>Guide to the expression of uncertainty
    in measurement (GUM)</em>, for carrying out the calculations required as part
    of an evaluation of measurement uncertainty. The approach applies to arbitrary
    models having a single output quantity where the input quantities are characterized
    by any specified probability density functions (PDFs).</p><p>ISO/IEC Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008
    is primarily concerned with the expression of uncertainty in the measurement of
    a well-defined physical quantity—the measurand—that can be characterized by an
    essentially unique value. It provides guidance in situations where the conditions
    for the GUM uncertainty frameworkare not fulfilled, or it is unclear whether they
    are fulfilled. It can be used when it is difficult to apply the GUM uncertainty
    framework, because of the complexity of the model, for example. Guidance is given
    in a form suitable for computer implementation.</p><p>ISO/IEC Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008
    can be used to provide (a representation of) the PDF for the output quantity from
    which (a) an estimate of the output quantity, (b) the standard uncertainty associated
    with this estimate, and (c) a coverage interval for that quantity, corresponding
    to a specified coverage probability, can be obtained.</p><p>For a prescribed coverage
    probability, it can be used to provide any required coverage interval, including
    the probabilistically symmetric coverage interval and the shortest coverage interval.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    Guide 98-3/Suppl.1:2008 applies to input quantities that are independent, where
    each such quantity is assigned an appropriate PDF, or not independent, i.e. when
    some or all of these quantities are assigned a joint PDF.</p><p>Detailed examples
    illustrate the guidance provided.</p>"
