    Provides SMD manufacturers and users with standardized methods for handling, packing, shipping, and use of moisture/reflow sensitive SMDs. These methods are provided to avoid damage from moisture absorption and exposure to solder reflow temperatures that can result in yield and reliability degradation.
    Applicable to all nonhermetic SMDs subjected to bulk solder reflow processes during PCB assembly, including plastic encapsulated packages and all other packages made with moisture-permeable polymeric materials that are exposed to the ambient air. IEC/PAS 62169 is in the process of being re-issued in the form of IEC international standard under reference IEC 60749-20-1.
