abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-4:2013<strong></strong>is intended to be used in any sector
    of activity. It specifies:</p><p>a) contents of command-response pairs exchanged
    at the interface,</p><p>b) means of retrieval of data elements and data objects
    in the card,</p><p>c) structures and contents of historical bytes to describe
    operating characteristics of the card,</p><p>d) structures for applications and
    data in the card, as seen at the interface when processing commands,</p><p>e)
    access methods to files and data in the card,</p><p>f) a security architecture
    defining access rights to files and data in the card,</p><p>g) means and mechanisms
    for identifying and addressing applications in the card,</p><p>h) methods for
    secure messaging,</p><p>i) access methods to the algorithms processed by the card.
    It does not describe these algorithms.</p><p>It does not cover the internal implementation
    within the card or the outside world.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7816-4:2013 is independent
    from the physical interface technology. It applies to cards accessed by one or
    more of the following methods: contacts, close coupling and radio frequency. If
    the card supports simultaneous use of more than one physical interface, the relationship
    between what happens on different physical interfaces is out of the scope of ISO/IEC
    7816-4:2013.</p>"
