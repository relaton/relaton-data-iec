abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides privacy engineering guidelines that are intended
    to help organizations integrate recent advances in privacy engineering into system
    life cycle processes. It describes:</p><p>— the relationship between privacy engineering
    and other engineering viewpoints (system engineering, security engineering, risk
    management); and</p><p>— privacy engineering activities in key engineering processes
    such as knowledge management, risk management, requirement analysis, and architecture
    design.</p><p>The intended audience includes engineers and practitioners who are
    involved in the development, implementation or operation of systems that need
    privacy consideration, as well as managers in organizations responsible for privacy,
    development, product management, marketing, and operations.</p>"
