abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 14496-26:2010 specifies how tests can be designed to verify whether
    compressed data and decoders meet requirements specified by ISO/IEC 14496-3. In
    ISO/IEC 14496-26:2010, encoders are not addressed specifically. An encoder may
    be said to be an ISO/IEC 14496 encoder if it generates compressed data compliant
    with the syntactic and semantic bitstream payload requirements specified in ISO/IEC
    14496-3.<br /><br />\r\nCharacteristics of compressed data and decoders are defined
    for ISO/IEC 14496-3. The compressed data characteristics define the subset of
    the standard that is exploited in the compressed data. Examples are the applied
    values or range of the sampling rate and bitrate parameters. Decoder characteristics
    define the properties and capabilities of the applied decoding process. An example
    of a property is the applied arithmetic accuracy. The capabilities of a decoder
    specify which compressed data the decoder can decode and reconstruct, by defining
    the subset of the standard that may be exploited in the decodable compressed data.
    Compressed data can be decoded by a decoder if the characteristics of the compressed
    data are within the subset of the standard specified by the decoder capabilities.<br
    /><br />\r\nProcedures are described for testing conformance of compressed data
    and decoders to the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3. Given the set of
    characteristics claimed, the requirements that must be met are fully determined
    by ISO/IEC 14496-3. ISO/IEC 14496-26:2010 summarises the requirements, cross references
    them to characteristics, and defines how conformance with them can be tested.
    Guidelines are given on constructing tests to verify decoder conformance. Some
    examples of compressed data implemented according to these guidelines are provided
    as an electronic annex to this document usually together with their uncompressed
    counterparts (reference waveforms)."
