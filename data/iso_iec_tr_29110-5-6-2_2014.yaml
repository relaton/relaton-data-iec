abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) website.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29110 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises, organizations,
    departments or projects having up to 25 people. The lifecycle processes described
    in the set of International Standards (IS) and Technical Reports (TR) are not
    intended to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.
    ISO/IEC 29110-5-6-2:2014 provides the management and engineering guide to the
    Basic Profile described in ISO/IEC 29110-4-6 through Project Management and System
    Definition and realization processes. It is a standalone guide; it is not intended
    for a VSE to use the standardized profile to implement ISO/IEC 29110-5-6-2:2014.
    ISO/IEC 29110-5-6-2:2014 applies for non-critical systems development projects.
    The system development should fulfil the project requirements and the system description.
    ISO/IEC 29110-5-6-2:2014, a VSE can obtain benefits in the following aspects:
    - An agreed set of project requirements (technical part of contract) and expected
    products are agreed by the Acquirer. - A disciplined management process, that
    provides project visibility and corrective actions of project problems and deviations,
    is performed. - A systematic System Definition and Realization process, that satisfies
    Acquirer needs and ensures quality products, is followed. VSEs developing software
    that is part of a larger system, and for stand-alone software products and services,
    are encouraged to use the management and engineering guide of the Basic Profile
    (ISO/IEC 29110-5-1-2)."
