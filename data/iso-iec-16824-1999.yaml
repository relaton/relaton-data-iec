    <p>This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of a 120 mm optical disk to enable</p>
    <p>interchange of such disks. It specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method,</p>
    <p>thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many</p>
    <p>times using the phase change method. This disk is identified as DVD-RAM.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>-  two related but different Types of this disk (see clause 7),</p>
    <p>-  the conditions for conformance,</p>
    <p>-  the environments in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored,</p>
    <p>-  the mechanical, physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data</p>
    <p>processing systems,</p>
    <p>-  the format of the information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting</p>
    <p>codes and the coding method,</p>
    <p>-  the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to read the data from the disk.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for</p>
    <p>volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems. The optical disks specified by</p>
    <p>this International Standard may be enclosed in cases according to ISO/IEC 16825 as specified therein.</p>
