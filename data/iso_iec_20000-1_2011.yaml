abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 is a service management system (SMS) standard. It
    specifies requirements for the service provider to plan, establish, implement,
    operate, monitor, review, maintain and improve an SMS. The requirements include
    the design, transition, delivery and improvement of services to fulfil agreed
    service requirements.\nISO/IEC 20000-1:2011 can be used by:\n- an organization
    seeking services from service providers and requiring assurance that their service
    requirements will be fulfilled; \n- an organization that requires a consistent
    approach by all its service providers, including those in a supply chain; \n-
    a service provider that intends to demonstrate its capability for the design,
    transition, delivery and improvement of services that fulfil service requirements;
    \n- a service provider to monitor, measure and review its service management processes
    and services; \n- a service provider to improve the design, transition, delivery
    and improvement of services through the effective implementation and operation
    of the SMS; \n- an assessor or auditor as the criteria for a conformity assessment
    of a service provider's SMS to the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1:2011."
