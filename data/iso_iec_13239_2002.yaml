abstract:
- content: <p>This International Standard specifies the frame structures, the elements
    of procedures, the classes of procedures, the content</p><p>and format of the
    general purpose Exchange Identification (XID) frame, and a means for resolution/negotiation
    of a data link</p><p>layer address in switched environments for data communication
    systems using bit-oriented high-level data link control</p><p>(HDLC) procedures.</p><p>NOTE
    The use of the phrase "bit-oriented", referring to the HDLC control procedures,
    pertains to the allocation of a non-integral number</p><p>of bits to various subfields
    used for HDLC control purposes. However, the frame as an entirety may be constructed
    from octet-oriented units</p><p>(e.g., start-stop mode) for transmission purposes.</p><p>The
    frame structure portion defines the relative positions of the various components
    of the basic frame format and the nonbasic</p><p>frame format. The mechanisms
    used to achieve bit pattern independence (transparency), where and when required,
    within</p><p>the frame are also defined. In addition, three frame checking sequences
    (FCS) are specified; the rules for address field</p><p>extension are defined;
    and the addressing conventions available are described.</p><p>The elements of
    procedures portion specifies elements of data link control procedures for synchronous
    or start/stop, codetransparent</p><p>data transmission using independent frame
    numbering in both directions.</p><p>These HDLC elements of procedures are defined
    specifically in terms of the actions that occur on receipt of commands at a</p><p>secondary
    station, a tributary station, a peer station, or a combined station.</p><p>This
    International Standard is intended to cover a wide range of applications; for
    example one-way, two-way alternate or twoway</p><p>simultaneous data communication
    between data stations which are usually buffered, including operations on different</p><p>types
    of data circuits; for example multipoint/point-to-point, duplex/half-duplex, switched/non-switched,
    synchronous/startstop,</p><p>etc.</p><p>The defined elements of procedures are
    to be considered as a common basis for establishing different types of data link
    control</p><p>procedures. This International Standard does not define any single
    system and should not be regarded as a specification for a</p><p>data communication
    system. Not all of the commands or responses are required for any particular system
    implementation.</p><p>The classes of procedures portion describes the HDLC unbalanced
    classes of procedures, the HDLC balanced class of</p><p>procedures, and the HDLC
    connectionless classes of procedures for synchronous or start/stop data transmission.</p><p>For
    the unbalanced classes, the data link consists of a primary station plus one or
    more secondary stations and operates in</p><p>either the normal response mode
    or the asynchronous response mode in a point-to-point or multipoint configuration.
    For the</p><p>balanced class, the data link consists of two combined stations
    and operates in the asynchronous balanced mode in a point-topoint</p><p>configuration.
    For the unbalanced connectionless class, the data link consists of a control station
    plus one or more</p><p>tributary stations and operates in the unbalanced connectionless-mode
    in a point-to-point or multipoint configuration. For the</p><p>balanced connectionless
    class, the data link consists of two peer stations and operates in the balanced
    connectionless-mode in a</p><p>point-to-point configuration. In each class, a
    basic repertoire of commands and responses is defined, but the capability of the</p><p>data
    link may be modified by the use of optional functions.</p><p>Balanced operation
    is intended for use in circumstances which require equal control at either end
    of the data link. Operational</p><p>requirements are covered in accordance with
    the overall HDLC architecture.</p><p>The content and format of the Exchange Identification
    (XID) frame portion builds on the fact that the principal use of the XID</p><p>frame
    is to exchange data link information between two or more HDLC stations. For the
    purpose of this International Standard,</p><p><strong>ISO/IEC 13239:2002(E)</strong></p><p><strong>2</strong>©
    ISO/IEC 2002? All rights reserved</p><p>data link information shall include any
    and all essential operational characteristics such as identification, authentication
    and/or</p><p>selection of optional functions and facilities concerning each station.
    This International Standard defines a single-exchange</p><p>negotiation procedure
    for establishing operational characteristics when either one or more stations
    are capable of providing</p><p>multiple selections.</p><p>This International Standard
    provides a means for exchanging the necessary information to establish, at a minimum,
    a data link</p><p>connection between two correspondents wishing to communicate.
    It describes a general purpose XID frame information field</p><p>content and format
    for that purpose.</p><p>It defines encoding for information related to the basic
    HDLC standards only. Mechanisms are provided to permit the general</p><p>purpose
    XID frame information field to be used to negotiate private parameters in a single
    XID exchange simultaneously with</p><p>negotiation of the defined basic parameters.</p><p>This
    International Standard does not limit or restrict the use of the XID frame information
    field from defining other standard</p><p>formats for use in specific applications.</p><p>The
    following are examples of potential uses of the XID command/response frame interchange:</p><p>a)
    Identification of the calling and called stations when using circuit switched
    networks (including switched network backup</p><p>applications).</p><p>b) Identification
    of stations operating on non-switched networks requiring identification at start-up.</p><p>c)
    The XID command frame with an individual, group or all-station address may be
    used to solicit XID response frame(s)</p><p>from other station(s) on the data
    link, prior to or following data link establishment.</p><p>d) Negotiation of the
    Frame Check Sequence (FCS) to be used for subsequent information interchange,
    by stations that</p><p>support both 16-bit FCS and 32-bit FCS capabilities.</p><p>e)
    Convey higher layer information that may be required prior to data link establishment.</p><p>f)
    Transmission of an XID response frame at any respond opportunity to request an
    XID exchange to modify some of the</p><p>operational parameters (for example,
    window size) following data link establishment.</p><p>g) Negotiation of the number
    of protected bits in the frame when an Unnumbered Information with Header check
    (UIH)</p><p>frame is used.</p><p>The means for resolution/negotiation of a data
    link layer address in switched environments portion is applicable to data stations</p><p>employing
    HDLC balanced classes of procedures which provide the XID command/response capability
    with the two specific</p><p>parameter fields, identified below. It is used to
    select a pair of operational link addresses when preassigned, system designated</p><p>addresses
    are not known on an a priori basis; e.g., switched circuited data links. Additional
    XID frame functions (including the</p><p>exchange of operational parameters, command/response
    support, higher layer information, etc.) may be accomplished in</p><p>conjunction
    with data link layer address determination or following address determination,
    with additional XID frame</p><p>exchanges.</p><p>NOTE Address resolution procedures
    for situations where the remote DTE does not support XID frames, the "all-station"</p><p>address,
    or complete address support capabilities as defined in clause 8 below are not
    within the scope of this International</p><p>Standard.</p>
