abstract:
- content: "ISO TR 21954:2018 This document considers and identifies criteria about
    the intended patient, intended use environment, and intended operator across the
    spectrum of the types of ventilation-related equipment as listed below:<br />\r\n—
    gas-powered resuscitator as specified in ISO 10651-5[1] [1];<br />\r\n— operator-powered
    resuscitator as specified in ISO 10651-4[2];<br />\r\n— ventilator for critical
    care as specified in ISO 80601-2-12[3] [2];<br />\r\n— ventilator for emergency
    medical services environment as specified in ISO 80601-2-84[4] [3], the future
    replacement for ISO 10651-3[5];<br />\r\nNOTE 1 ISO 80601‐2‐84 updates the content
    of ISO 10651‐3 and harmonizes it with IEC 60601-1:2005+AMD1:2012[6] and IEC 60601-1-12:2014[7].<br
    />\r\n— ventilator for ventilatory impairment in the home healthcare environment
    as specified in ISO 80601‑2‑79[8];<br />\r\n— ventilator for ventilatory insufficiency
    in the home healthcare environment as specified in ISO 80601‑2‑80[9];<br />\r\n—
    ventilator for ventilator-dependent patients in the home healthcare environment
    as specified in ISO 80601-2-72[10];<br />\r\n— sleep apnoea breathing therapy
    equipment as specified in ISO 80601-2-70[11].<br />\r\nNOTE 2 Sleep apnoea breathing
    therapy equipment is not considered to be an artificial ventilator. It is included
    in this discussion to highlight the differences, which indicate why sleep apnoea
    breathing therapy equipment is not considered a ventilator.<br />\r\nThis document
    is intended to provide guidance that can assist manufacturers, authorities having
    jurisdiction and users in the development, selection and application of different
    types of ventilatory equipment based on the intended patient, intended use environment
    and intended operator.<br />\r\n[1] Numbers in square brackets refer to the Bibliography.<br
