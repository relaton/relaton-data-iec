  content: "IEC TR 61850-7-5:2021, which is a technical report, establishes modelling
    concepts that help the user to understand how to apply the models defined in IEC
    61850-7-4 and IEC 61850-7-3 to implement practical applications.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides the basic concepts that are valid for all application domains
    using IEC 61850. Domain specific concepts are defined in other technical reports
    as in the document range of IEC 61850-7-5xx; as an example, IEC 61850-7-500 describes
    modelling concepts for functions related to substation automation.<br />\r\nOn
    one side the number of potential topics for cross-domain modelling may be very
    high but on the other side it may be limited by domain specific restrictions often
    created by the historical evolution of IEC 61850 in the domains.<br />\r\nThe
    first topic selected is the common control of power utility primary objects by
    means of the power utility automation systems based mainly on the long experience
    in substation automation systems. Common attributes for reliable power utility
    automation systems in all domains are quality and health. A special function having
    a broad application range in power utility automation systems is the scheduling
    of services as provided by the domain distributed energy resources (DER) used
    in smart grids, especially also for electric mobility. Not yet so much discussed
    in the context of IEC 61850 but very important for all IEDs is the impact of restart
    (power cycle) on the data model parameters. Non-agreed behaviour will raise problems
    for interoperability in multi-vendor systems."
