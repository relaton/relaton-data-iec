abstract:
- content: "IEC 61158-4-24:2023 provides<br />\r\nprocedures for the timely transfer
    of data and control information from one data-link user entity to a peer user
    entity, and among the data-link entities forming the distributed datalink service
    provider;<br />\r\nprocedures for giving communications opportunities to all participating
    DL-entities (DLEs), sequentially and in a cyclic manner for deterministic and
    synchronized transfer at cyclic intervals up to 64 ms;<br />\r\nprocedures for
    giving communication opportunities available for time-critical data transmission
    together with non-time-critical data transmission without prejudice to the time-critical
    data transmission;<br />\r\nprocedures for giving cyclic and acyclic communication
    opportunities for time-critical data transmission with prioritized access;<br
    />\r\nprocedures for giving communication opportunities based on ISO/IEC/IEEE
    8802â€‘3 medium access control, with provisions for nodes to be added or removed
    during normal operation;<br />\r\nthe structure of the fieldbus DLPDUs used for
    the transfer of data and control information by the protocol of this document,
    and their representation as physical interface data units."
