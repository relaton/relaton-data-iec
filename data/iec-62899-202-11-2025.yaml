  script: Latn
  content: IEC 62899-202-11:2025 specifies a measurement method of electrical resistance
    uniformity for large area printed conductive layers. The purpose of this method
    is to measure resistance uniformity of planar large area printed layers. This
    method cannot measure sheet resistance. The methods measure electrical resistance
    or electrical potential drop and use direct contact.
