abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013:2021 is applicable to three-phase AC high-voltage
    generator circuit-breakers, hereafter called generator circuit-breakers, designed
    for indoor or outdoor installation and for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and
    60 Hz on systems having voltages above 1 kV and up to 38 kV.<br />\r\nThis document
    is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo standard.<br />\r\nThe IEEE Std C37.013â„¢-1997
    (R2008) was revised and converted into the first edition of the IEC/IEEE Dual
    Logo International Standard IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013 published in 2015.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2015. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\ncontent
    has been added to address the requirements of the other components of the generator
    circuit breaker system;<br />\r\nrequirements for the application of generator
    circuit-breakers in power plants with multiple generators connected to one step-up
    transformer have been added;<br />\r\nrequirements for testing and application
    of Tee-OFF generator circuit-breakers have been added;<br />\r\nrequirements for
    application of generator circuit-breakers in power plants with doubly-fed induction
    machines, pumped-storage power plants, and wind farms have been added;<br />\r\nthe
    clause numbering has been aligned with the numbering in IEC 62271-1:2017;<br />\r\nthe
    topic of reference mechanical characteristics has been revised to improve clarity;<br
    />\r\nthe modifying effects of capacitors on the prospective TRVs for out-of-phase
    and load current switching has been addressed in Annex M and in Annex N with use
    of the tool named \"GenCB TRV calculator\". This tool provides the values of KE2,
    RRRV0, KRRRV-U, KRRRV-I, td0, Ktd-U, Ktd-I, as well as the values of the parameters
    of the prospective TRV modified by the capacitors of the generator circuit-breaker.<br
    />\r\nThis document contains attached files in the form of Excel spreadsheets
    (\"GenCB TRV calculator\"). These files are intended to be used as a complement
    and do not form an integral part of the document."
