abstract:
- content: CISPR TR 16-4-4:2007+AMD1:2017+AMD2:2020 contains a recommendation on how
    to deal with statistics of radio interference complaints. Furthermore it describes
    the calculation of limits for disturbance field strength and voltage for the measurement
    on a test site based on models for the distribution of disturbances by radiated
    and conducted coupling. This second edition of CISPR 16-4-4 contains two thoroughly
    updated Clauses 4 and 5, compared with its first edition. It also contains, in
    its new Annex A, values of the classical CISPR mains decoupling factor which were
    determined by measurements in real low-voltage AC mains grids in the 1960s respectively.<strong>This
    consolidated version consists of the second edition (2007), its amendment 1 (2017)
    and it amendment 2 (2020). Therefore, no need to order amendment in addition to
    this publication.</strong>
