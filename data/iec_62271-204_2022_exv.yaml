abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-204:2022 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62271-204:2022 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62271-1:2017+AMD1:2021 CSV and IEC 62271-203:2022.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-204:2022
    applies to rigid HV gas‑insulated transmission lines (GIL) in which the insulation
    is obtained, at least partly, by an insulating gas or gas mixture other than air
    at atmos­pheric pressure, for alternating current of rated voltages above 52 kV,
    and for service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- update to be in line with IEC 62271-1:2017
    and alignment of the voltage ratings and the test voltages.<br />\r\n- addition
    of new information for welds on pressurized parts and gas tightness."
