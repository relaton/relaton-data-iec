    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n-
    measurement of the transmission performance of modular plug terminated link (MPTL)
    and direct attach cabling were added.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\n- Additional requirements
    of test head designs of E2E link were introduced.&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;\r\nThe contents
