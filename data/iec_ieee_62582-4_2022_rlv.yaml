abstract:
- content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-4:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 62582-4:2022
    specifies methods for condition monitoring of organic and polymeric materials
    in instrumentation and control systems using oxidation induction techniques in
    the detail necessary to produce accurate and reproducible measurements. It includes
    the requirements for sample preparation, the measurement system and conditions,
    and the reporting of the measurement results. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2011, and its Amendment 1:2016. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- Consideration of publication of IEC/IEEE 60780-323;<br />\r\n-
    An example added in Annex B and update;<br />\r\n- Annex C added."
