abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61857-2:2025 gives guidelines to identify the appropriate test
    method for the evaluation of a proposed electrical insulation system (EIS). Some
    of the standards evaluate the EIS using one stress factor which is thermal. Other
    standards evaluate the thermal stress factor with adjustments to the conditioning
    applied prior to the diagnostic testing to simulate applications in air. A third
    group of these standards when the application is other than in air. This technical
    report is applicable to existing or proposed EIS used in electrotechnical products
    across a wide range of operating voltages of IEC Standards. The report takes care
    to identify the appropriate standard based on construction and intended operating
    application.<br />\r\nFor all performance and safety requirements related to an
    application, refer to the technical committee requirements for the application.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition.<br />\r\na) The Introduction is expanded to convey that
    both TC 112 and TC 2 have established EIS test standards.<br />\r\nb) Clause 4
    introduces the fact that there are four stress factors, not only thermal. This
    essential concept carries over into part of Clause 5.<br />\r\nc) The large number
    of established standards are organized into common concept groups in Tables 1
    to 5:<br />\r\n1) Table 1 covers an overview of EIS evaluations for background
    and structure.<br />\r\n2) Table 2 covers evaluation of test objects prior to
    the start of long-term thermal ageing using screening tests.<br />\r\n3) Table
    3 covers test standards for the evaluation of thermal stresses in air and has
    an increased number of standards.<br />\r\n4) Table 4 covers standards for special
    environmental applications other than in air<br />\r\n5) Table 5 covers standards
    for the modification of an established EIS."
