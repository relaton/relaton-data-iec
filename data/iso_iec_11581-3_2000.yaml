abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 11581 applies to icons that are shown on a screen, that users
    can manipulate and interact with, and that</p><p>represent data or computer system
    functions. This part of ISO/IEC 11581 addresses only pointer icons. Pointers</p><p>are
    icons that are logically attached to a physical input device, and that the user
    manipulates to interact with other</p><p>screen elements, see ISO/IEC 11581-1.
    This part describes user interaction with and appearance of pointer icons</p><p>on
    the screen. It also specifies how pointer icons on a screen change appearance
    to give users feedback. Other</p><p>types of icons are covered in other parts
    of the standard that are listed in the Foreword.</p>"
