abstract:
- content: IEC 61427-2:2015+AMD1:2024 CSV relates to secondary batteries used in on-grid
    Electrical Energy Storage (EES) applications and provides the associated methods
    of test for the verification of their endurance, properties and electrical performance
    in such applications. The test methods are essentially battery chemistry neutral,
    i.e. applicable to all secondary battery types. On-grid applications are characterized
    by the fact that batteries are connected, via power conversion devices, to a regional
    or nation- or continent-wide electricity grid and act as instantaneous energy
    sources and sinks to stabilize the grids performance when randomly major amounts
    of electrical energy from renewable energy sources are fed into it. Related power
    conversion and interface equipment is not covered by this part of IEC 61427.
