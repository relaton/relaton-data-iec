  content: IEC PAS 63184:2021 specifies the assessment methods to evaluate compliance
    of stationary and dynamic wireless power transfer (WPT) systems with electromagnetic
    human exposure guidelines (external electric and magnetic fields, specific absorption
    rate (SAR), internal electric fields or current density including contact currents).
    The frequency range of this document is from 1 kHz to 30 MHz.
