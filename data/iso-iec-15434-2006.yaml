    <p>ISO/IEC 15434:2006 defines the manner in which data is transferred to high-capacity automatic data capture (ADC) media from a supplier's information system and the manner in which data is transferred to the recipient's information system. It does not define the internal data storage format for specific high-capacity ADC media, nor does it specify the application of data structures provided by a specific data syntax format. The application of the data structure is specified by industry conventions.</p>
    <p>Users of ADC technologies benefit by being able to receive data in a standard form and by being able to provide data in a standard form. Static ADC technologies such as bar code symbologies, magnetic stripe, optical character recognition, surface acoustical wave (SAW) and Weigand effect typically encode a single field of data. Most applications of these technologies involve the encoding of a single field of data by the supplier of the medium and the subsequent decoding of the data field by the recipient. Encoding single fields of data permits the supplier to perform the encodation from a single field within the supplier's information system. Decoding single fields of data permits the recipient to input this data into a single field in the recipient's information system, in lieu of key entry.</p>
    <p>High-capacity ADC technologies, such as two-dimensional symbols, RFID transponders, contact memories and smart cards, encode multiple fields of data. These multiple fields are usually parsed by the recipient's information system and then mapped to specific fields of data in the recipient's information system. ISO/IEC 15434:2006 defines the syntax for high-capacity ADC media, so as to enable ADC users to utilize a single mapping utility, regardless of which high-capacity ADC medium is employed.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15434:2006 specifies a transfer structure, syntax, and coding of messages and data formats when using high-capacity ADC media between trading partners (specifically between suppliers and recipients) and, where applicable, in support of carrier applications, such as bills of lading and carrier sortation and tracking.</p>
    <p>The data encoded according to ISO/IEC 15434:2006 include</p>
    <ul><li>data which may be used in the shipping, receiving, and inventory of transport units;</li><li>data which may be contained within supporting documentation, in paper or electronic form, related to unit loads or transport packages;</li><li>data which may be used in the sortation and tracking of transport units.</li></ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15434:2006 describes the ISO 646 syntax for automatic data capture. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15434:2006 is not the controlling specification for data structures (e.g. CII) referenced in ISO/IEC 15434:2006.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15434:2006 does not supersede or replace any applicable safety or regulatory marking or labelling requirements. It is to be applied in addition to any other mandated labelling requirements.</p>
