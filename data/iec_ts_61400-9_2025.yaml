abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61400-9:2025 sets out minimum requirements to the use of probabilistic
    design measures in order to ensure the structural and mechanical integrity of
    wind turbines. The document is based on the general approach in ISO 2394, which
    also forms the basis for IEC 61400-1. In 61400-1, the design verification approach
    is based on deterministic design using safety factors. However, edition 4 of IEC
    61400-1:2019 opens for introduction of probabilistic design in an informative
    annex specifying requirements to the calibration of structural material safety
    factors and structural design assisted by testing. IEC 61400-1 is the governing
    standard. This document provides appropriate methodologies and requirements for
    full probabilistic design by taking into account specific uncertainties on not
    only material properties but also on environmental conditions, design models and
    the degree of validation. This document also provides provisions for semi-probabilistic
    design, including reliability-based calibration of partial safety factors and
    assessment of existing wind turbines. The probabilistic methods in this document
    are formulated generically and can be applied to structural and mechanical failure
    modes where a limit state equation can be formulated.
