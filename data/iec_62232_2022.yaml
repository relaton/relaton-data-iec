abstract:
- content: "IEC 62232:2022 addresses the evaluation of RF field strength, power density
    and specific absorption rate (<em>SAR</em>) levels in the vicinity of base stations
    (BS), also called products or equipment under test (EUT), intentionally radiating
    in the radio frequency (RF) range 110 MHz to 300 GHz in accordance with the scope,
    see Clause 1. It does not address the evaluation of current density.<br />\r\nRF
    exposure evaluation methods to be used for product compliance, product installation
    compliance and in-situ RF exposure assessments are specified in this document.
    Exposure limits are not specified in this document. The entity conducting RF exposure
    assessments refers to the set of exposure limits applicable where exposure takes
    place. Examples of applicable exposure limits considered in this document are
    provided in the Bibliography, for example ICNIRP-2020 [1], ICNIRP-1998 [2], IEEE
    Std C95.1â„¢-2019 [3] and Safety Code 6 [4]."
