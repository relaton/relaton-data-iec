abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15026-4:2012 gives guidance and recommendations for conducting
    selected processes, activities and tasks for systems and software products requiring
    assurance claims for properties selected for special attention, called critical
    properties. ISO/IEC 15026-4:2012 specifies a property-independent list of processes,
    activities and tasks to achieve the claim and show the achievement of the claim.
    ISO/IEC 15026-4:2012 establishes the processes, activities, tasks, guidance and
    recommendations in the context of a defined life cycle model and set of life cycle
    processes for system and/or software life cycle management.
