  content: "<p>Will provide users of voice messaging systems with a consistent mode
    of interaction in a way that is independent of the underlying system implementations.
    The interface is based on a set of design guidelines defined in annex A. The interface
    supports the ability of all users described in the user-system model to access
    the features of voice messaging systems. In the call answering application, the
    interface allows callers to leave messages from all types of telephones. In the
    voice mail application, the interface allows subscribers to send and receive voice
    messages and to manage stored data.</p>"
