    <p>ISO/IEC 18033 specifies encryption systems (ciphers) for the purpose of data confidentiality.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 specifies block ciphers. A block cipher is a symmetric encipherment system with the property that the encryption algorithm operates on a block of plaintext, i.e. a string of bits of a defined length, to yield a block of ciphertext.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18033-3:2005 specifies the following algorithms.</p>
    64-bit block ciphers: TDEA, MISTY1, CAST-128.128-bit block ciphers: AES, Camellia, SEED.<p>NOTE The primary purpose of encryption (or<em>encipherment</em>) techniques is to protect the confidentiality of stored or transmitted data. An encryption algorithm is applied to data (often called<em>plaintext</em> or<em>cleartext</em>) to yield encrypted data (or<em>ciphertext</em>); this process is known as<em>encryption</em>. The encryption algorithm is designed so that the ciphertext yields no information about the plaintext except, perhaps, its length. Associated with every encryption algorithm is a corresponding<em>decryption algorithm</em>, which transforms ciphertext back into its original plaintext.</p>
