abstract:
- content: "IEC 63601:2026 covers SiC-based PECS devices having a gate dielectric
    region biased to turn devices on and off. This typically refers to MOS devices
    such as MOSFETs and IGBTs. In this document, only NMOS (N-type MOS) devices are
    discussed as these are dominant for power device applications; however, the procedures
    apply to PMOS (P-type MOS) devices as well.<br />\r\nThis document does not define
    device failure criteria, acceptable use conditions or acceptable lifetime targets.
    That is up to the device manufacturers and users. However, it provides stress
    procedures such that the threshold voltage stability over time as affected by
    gate bias and temperature can be demonstrated and evaluated."
