abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Standard Library
    (1.2). These extensions are classes and</p><p>functions that are likely to be
    used widely within a program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries
    written</p><p>by different organizations.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is non-normative.
    Some of the library components in this technical specification may be</p><p>considered
    for standardization in a future version of C++, but they are not currently part
    of any C++ standard. Some of</p><p>the components in this technical specification
    may never be standardized, and others may be standardized in a</p><p>substantially
    changed form.</p><p>The goal of ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is to build more widespread
    existing practice for an expanded C++ standard</p><p>library. It gives advice
    on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide them.</p>"
