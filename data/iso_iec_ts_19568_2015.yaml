abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 describes extensions to the C++ Standard Library
    (1.2). These extensions are classes and functions that are likely to be used widely
    within a program and/or on the interface boundaries between libraries written
    by different organizations. ISO/IEC TS 19568:2015 is non-normative. Some of the
    library components in this technical specification may be considered for standardization
    in a future version of C++, but they are not currently part of any C++ standard.
    Some of the components in this technical specification may never be standardized,
    and others may be standardized in a substantially changed form. The goal of ISO/IEC
    TS 19568:2015 is to build more widespread existing practice for an expanded C++
    standard library. It gives advice on extensions to those vendors who wish to provide
    them.
