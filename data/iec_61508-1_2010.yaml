abstract:
- content: "IEC 61508-1:2010 covers those aspects to be considered when electrical/electronic/programmable
    electronic (E/E/PE) systems are used to carry out safety functions. A major objective
    of this standard is to facilitate the development of product and application sector
    international standards by the technical committees responsible for the product
    or application sector. This will allow all the relevant factors, associated with
    the product or application, to be fully taken into account and thereby meet the
    specific needs of users of the product and the application sector. A second objective
    of this standard is to enable the development of E/E/PE safety-related systems
    where product or application sector international standards do not exist. This
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1998. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. It has been subject to a thorough review
    and incorporates many comments received at the various revision stages. It has
    the status of a basic safety publication according to IEC Guide 104.<br /><br
    />\r\nNEW! Also available: IEC Standards+ 61508:2010, containing all parts, together
    with a commented Redline version. Changes made in this 2nd edition are highlighted
    and commented by a leading world expert.<br /><br />\r\nThis publication is of
    high relevance for Smart Grid."
