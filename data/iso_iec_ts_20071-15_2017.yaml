abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 provides guidance on various aspects of the
    user interface of applications that scan visual information that are used directly
    by humans, including:</p><p>- initiating the scanning application;</p><p>- setting
    user's preferences and configuring the scanning application;</p><p>- identifying
    the types of information currently of interest to the user;</p><p>- locating visual
    objects of interest to the user;</p><p>- creating a static image via scanning
    the visual object;</p><p>- identifying the information content provided by the
    visual object;</p><p>- processing scanned information and outputting the results
    to the user.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 provides increased accessibility by
    addressing the user accessibility needs of diverse users in diverse contexts.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 20071-15:2017 contains guidance that can be applied to a variety of devices,
    including:</p><p>- specialized devices that are dedicated to scanning and processing
    visual information;</p><p>- mobile devices (such as smartphones and tablets);</p><p>-
    general purpose computers with camera capabilities;</p><p>- office machines with
    scanning functions.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 contains guidance that can
    be applied to various types of software, including:</p><p>- stand-alone scanning
    applications;</p><p>- applications including scanning functionalities;</p><p>-
    (scanning) applications that interoperate with other applications.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 20071-15:2017 contains guidance that can be used for outputting scanned information
    in various modalities, including:</p><p>- audio outputs;</p><p>- visual outputs;</p><p>-
    tactile outputs;</p><p>- storing information for future use within the application
    performing the scanning;</p><p>- electronic outputs (to other applications, systems,
    or devices including those directly connected and those connected via the Internet).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TS 20071-15:2017 does not:</p><p>- apply to fully automated scanning that is not
    under direct human control;</p><p>- apply to applications that scan visual information
    for editing an image or just displaying it;</p><p>- provide guidance on the design
    of specific hardware devices involved in scanning;</p><p>- provide guidance on
    the specific objects that can be recognized or the specific software used to recognize
    these objects;</p><p>- provide guidance on the internal functioning of software
    that recognizes specific types of objects.</p><p>ISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 is intended
    for use by developers of applications that include user controlled scanning functionalities.
    It does not expect that an application includes all of these functionalities.
    It can be used for those functionalities that an application does provide.</p>"
