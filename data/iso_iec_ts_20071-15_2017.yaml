abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 provides guidance on various aspects of the user
    interface of applications that scan visual information that are used directly
    by humans, including:<br />\r\n- initiating the scanning application;<br />\r\n-
    setting user's preferences and configuring the scanning application;<br />\r\n-
    identifying the types of information currently of interest to the user;<br />\r\n-
    locating visual objects of interest to the user;<br />\r\n- creating a static
    image via scanning the visual object;<br />\r\n- identifying the information content
    provided by the visual object;<br />\r\n- processing scanned information and outputting
    the results to the user.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 provides increased
    accessibility by addressing the user accessibility needs of diverse users in diverse
    contexts.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 contains guidance that can be applied
    to a variety of devices, including:<br />\r\n- specialized devices that are dedicated
    to scanning and processing visual information;<br />\r\n- mobile devices (such
    as smartphones and tablets);<br />\r\n- general purpose computers with camera
    capabilities;<br />\r\n- office machines with scanning functions.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 20071-15:2017 contains guidance that can be applied to various types of software,
    including:<br />\r\n- stand-alone scanning applications;<br />\r\n- applications
    including scanning functionalities;<br />\r\n- (scanning) applications that interoperate
    with other applications.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017 contains guidance that
    can be used for outputting scanned information in various modalities, including:<br
    />\r\n- audio outputs;<br />\r\n- visual outputs;<br />\r\n- tactile outputs;<br
    />\r\n- storing information for future use within the application performing the
    scanning;<br />\r\n- electronic outputs (to other applications, systems, or devices
    including those directly connected and those connected via the Internet).<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TS 20071-15:2017 does not:<br />\r\n- apply to fully automated scanning that is
    not under direct human control;<br />\r\n- apply to applications that scan visual
    information for editing an image or just displaying it;<br />\r\n- provide guidance
    on the design of specific hardware devices involved in scanning;<br />\r\n- provide
    guidance on the specific objects that can be recognized or the specific software
    used to recognize these objects;<br />\r\n- provide guidance on the internal functioning
    of software that recognizes specific types of objects.<br />\r\nISO/IEC TS 20071-15:2017
    is intended for use by developers of applications that include user controlled
    scanning functionalities. It does not expect that an application includes all
    of these functionalities. It can be used for those functionalities that an application
    does provide."
