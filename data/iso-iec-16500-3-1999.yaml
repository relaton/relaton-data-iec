    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 16500 on "Contours: Technology Domain" describes the system functions and DAVIC</p>
    <p>tools relevant to the Contours defined in ISO/IEC TR 165001. A goal of this part of ISO/IEC 16500 is to guide</p>
    <p>implementers to those parts of ISO/IEC 16500 which are relevant for the implementation of the systems in each</p>
    <p>Contour and to show the relation between the various tools. Another goal of this specification is to state which</p>
    <p>specific DAVIC tools have to be implemented to realize interoperable system components.</p>
    <p>As the underlying trade-off between system component cost and service revenue may vary considerably, e.g., by</p>
    <p>geographical location and time, this trade-off is deemed to be outside of the scope of DAVIC and hence a more</p>
    <p>detailed "micro profiling" of the tool set needs to be agreed upon between the various parties involved with the</p>
    <p>realization of a system. An STB that is fully interoperable with, for example, Enhanced Broadcast Services within</p>
    <p>a certain geographical area, can be designed by implementing all defined DAVIC tools used by the Enhanced</p>
    <p>Broadcast Services in that area.</p>
    <p>In order to assist the above mentioned micro-profiling activity the DAVIC tools relevant to a specific Contour</p>
    <p>have been structured in the following way. A collection of DAVIC tools (sub/clauses of ISO/IEC 16500) which</p>
    <p>together realize a complete system function (e.g., the reliable transmission of synchronized multimedia</p>
    <p>information) are grouped together. The group is identified as "system function". For each of these groups an</p>
    <p>overall informative description is given and a table listing in detail the included DAVIC tools. For the tools</p>
    <p>dependencies are indicated if applicable. The functional requirements derived from the User &amp; Market Domain of</p>
    <p>a contour (see ISO/IEC TR 16501) are fully mapped to the above list of system functions.</p>
