abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-99:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-99:2021
    deals with the safety of electrically operated commercial hoods intended for installation
    above commercial cooking appliances such as ranges, griddles, griddle grills and
    deep fat fryers, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single phase
    hoods connected between one phase and neutral, and 480 V for other hoods. Only
    single complete units and hoods supplied as separate parts which when assembled
    form a complete working hood, incorporating a fan, are within the scope of the
    standard.<br />\r\nThe hood may be used above one or more appliance or types of
    appliances.<br />\r\nThe following extraction systems are within the scope of
    this standard:<br />\r\n- back-draft ventilation systems;<br />\r\n- down-draft
    ventilation systems;<br />\r\n- fume extraction modules.<br />\r\nThese appliances
    are not intended for household and similar purposes. They are used in areas not
    open to the public, for example in kitchens of restaurants, canteens, hospitals
    and in commercial enterprises such as bakeries and butcheries.<br />\r\nAs far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by these
    types of appliances.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n-
    for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional
    requirements including ventilation requirements are specified by the national
    health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection of
    labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply to:<br />\r\n-
    domestic range hoods (IEC 60335-2-31);<br />\r\n- purpose-built hoods, although
    this standard can be used as a guide (a purpose-built hood is either constructed
    on-site or specially constructed in the factory and is not mass produced);<br
    />\r\n- appliances not incorporating a fan;<br />\r\n- appliances designed exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003 and Amendment
    1:2017. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes
    have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 11.7, 22.102, 22.104, 27.2, 30.101);<br
    />\r\nc) exclusion of battery-operated appliances and appliances used in areas
    open to the public (Clause 1);<br />\r\nd) addition of requirement for appliances
    incorporating means for ionizing air (32.101);<br />\r\ne) conciliation of the
    text of IEC 60335-2-99 with other standards under IEC/TC61/MT32.<br />\r\nThis
    Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
