  content: "ISO/IEC 29341-4-14:2011(E) The ScheduledRecording service is a UPnP service
    that allows control points to schedule the recording of content. Generally, this
    content is broadcast content, but this specification does not limit itself to
    broadcast content. This service type enables the following functions:<br/>                \n-
    Create a recordSchedule.<br/>                         \n- Browse a list of recordSchedule
    instances stored by the ScheduledRecording service.<br/>                        \n-
    Delete a recordSchedule.<br/>                         \n- Browse a list of recordTask
    instances, stored by the ScheduledRecording service. The ScheduledRecording service
    may create zero or more recordTask instances for each recordSchedule. A recordTask
    represents a discrete recording operation of a recordSchedule.<br/>                                   -
    Enable or disable individual recordTask instances.<br/>         \n- Enable or
    disable a recordSchedule.<br/>                        \n- Receive notifications
    indicating change of recordSchedule or recordTask list.<br/>                                             \nThis
    device specification is compliant with the Universal Plug and Play Device Architecture
    version 1.0. It defines a device type referred to herein as ScheduledRecording.
    This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-14, first edition, published
    in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision."
