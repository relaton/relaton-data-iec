abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs).
    VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people.
    The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110:2016 series are not intended
    to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.<br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29110-5-2-1:2016 is the Organizational management guidance for profiles described
    in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through Organizational Management, Project Portfolio Management,
    Resource Management and Process Management Processes. It is not intended for a
    VSE to use the standardized profile to implement ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016.<br
    />\r\nUsing ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016, a VSE can obtain benefits in the following
    aspects:<br />\r\n- multiple project execution and supervision of its performance,
    making sure all processes are executed according to the organizational strategy;<br
    />\r\n- continuous monitoring of the customer satisfaction;<br />\r\n- deployment
    and improvement of the organizational standard processes in all projects;<br />\r\n-
    controlled provision of required resources."
