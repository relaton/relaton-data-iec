abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs).
    VSEs are enterprises, organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people.
    The lifecycle processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110:2016 series are not intended
    to preclude or discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    29110-5-2-1:2016 is the Organizational management guidance for profiles described
    in ISO/IEC 29110-4-1 through Organizational Management, Project Portfolio Management,
    Resource Management and Process Management Processes. It is not intended for a
    VSE to use the standardized profile to implement ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016.</p><p>Using
    ISO/IEC 29110-5-2-1:2016, a VSE can obtain benefits in the following aspects:</p><p>?
    multiple project execution and supervision of its performance, making sure all
    processes are executed according to the organizational strategy;</p><p>? continuous
    monitoring of the customer satisfaction;</p><p>? deployment and improvement of
    the organizational standard processes in all projects;</p><p>? controlled provision
    of required resources.</p>"
