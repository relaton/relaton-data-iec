abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 specifies minimum requirements for the structure
    and contents of an assurance case to improve the consistency and comparability
    of assurance cases and to facilitate stakeholder communications, engineering decisions,
    and other uses of assurance cases.<br /><br />\r\nAn assurance case includes a
    top-level claim for a property of a system or product (or set of claims), systematic
    argumentation regarding this claim, and the evidence and explicit assumptions
    that underlie this argumentation. Arguing through multiple levels of subordinate
    claims, this structured argumentation connects the top-level claim to the evidence
    and assumptions.<br /><br />\r\nAssurance cases are generally developed to support
    claims in areas such as safety, reliability, maintainability, human factors, operability,
    and security, although these assurance cases are often called by more specific
    names, e.g. safety case or reliability and maintainability (R&M) case.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15026-2:2011 does not place requirements on the quality of the contents
    of an assurance case and does not require the use of a particular terminology
    or graphical representation. Likewise, it places no requirements on the means
    of physical implementation of the data, including no requirements for redundancy
    or co-location."
