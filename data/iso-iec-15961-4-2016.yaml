    <p>ISO/IEC 15961-4:2016 provides a set of application commands and their associated responses for the following functions:</p>
    <p>-      to start and stop battery assistance;</p>
    <p>-      to select and de-select a particular sensory function supported by the RFID tag;</p>
    <p>-      to set sensor parameters both initially and ongoing;</p>
    <p>-      to start and stop the sensor monitoring the environment;</p>
    <p>-      to access sensor data;</p>
    <p>-      to establish the battery status.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24753 defines the encoding rules for identifying sensors, their functions, their delivered measurements, and the processing rules for sensor data. As such, it receives commands as defined in ISO/IEC 15961-4:2016 and provides the information that is required for the appropriate responses.</p>
