abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-25:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60335-2-25:2019 deals with
    the safety of microwave ovens for household and similar use, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V.<br />\r\nThis standard also deals with combination
    microwave ovens, for which Annex AA is applicable.<br />\r\nThis standard also
    deals with microwave ovens intended to be used on board ships, for which Annex
    BB is applicable.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal household use but
    which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. However, if the appliance is intended to be used professionally
    to process food for commercial purposes, the appliance is not considered to be
    for household and similar use only.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n– for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n– commercial microwave ovens (IEC 60335-2-90);<br />\r\n–
    industrial microwave heating equipment (IEC 60519-6);<br />\r\n– appliances for
    medical purposes (IEC 60601);<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis seventh edition cancels and replaces
    the sixth edition published in 2010, Amendment 1:2014 and Amendment 2:2015. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant changes with respect to the sixth edition:<br />\r\n– 11.7 and 19.13
    are improved in clarity;<br />\r\n– in 19.102, a note is converted into normative
    text;<br />\r\n– 19.101 is improved with an alternative measurement method;<br
    />\r\n– 22.121 is improved with requirements for simultaneous activation of heating
    elements and motors;<br />\r\n– 15.2, 15.101, 21, 22.102, 22.112, 22.119, 22.120,
    24.101 and 27.1 are improved in clarity;<br />\r\n– Annex A has editorial improvements
    and feasible limits of deviations.<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established
    on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard.</p>"
