    <p>ISO/IEC 8632 provides a file format suitable for the storage and retrieval of picture description information. The file</p>
    <p>format consists of an ordered set of elements that may be used to describe pictures in a way that is compatible</p>
    <p>between systems of different architectures, compatible with devices of differing capabilities and design, and</p>
    <p>meaningful to application constituencies. This picture description includes the capability for describing static</p>
    <p>images.</p>
    <p>The elements specified provide for the representation of a wide range of pictures on a wide range of graphical</p>
    <p>devices. The elements are organized into groups that delimit major structures (metafiles, pictures, and application</p>
    <p>structures), that specify the representations used within the metafile, that control the display of the picture, that</p>
    <p>perform basic drawing actions, that control the attributes of the basic drawing actions, that allow application-specific</p>
    <p>structuring to be overlaid on the graphical content, and that provide access to non-standard device capabilities.</p>
    <p>The metafile is defined in such a way that, in addition to sequential access to the whole metafile, random access to</p>
    <p>individual pictures and individual context-independent application structures is well-defined. Applications which</p>
    <p>require random access to pictures and/or context-independent application structures within pictures may, within the</p>
    <p>metafile, define directories to these pictures and/or context-independent application structures. The metafile may</p>
    <p>then be opened and randomly accessed without interpreting the entire metafile.</p>
    <p>In addition to a functional specification, two standard encodings of the metafile syntax are specified. These</p>
    <p>encodings address the needs of applications that require small metafile size plus minimum effort to generate and</p>
    <p>interpret, and maximum flexibility for a human reader or editor of the metafile.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8632 describes the format using an abstract syntax. The remaining parts of ISO 8632 specify</p>
    <p>standardized encodings that conform to this syntax: ISO/IEC 8632-3 specifies a binary encoding; ISO/IEC 8632-4</p>
    <p>specifies a clear text encoding.</p>
