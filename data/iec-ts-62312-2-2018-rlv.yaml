  content: "IEC TS 62312-2:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TS 62312-2:2018
    gives guidelines for methods of synchronization of audio and video. It describes
    the system model and general methods for the synchronization of audio and video.
    The methods exclude the synchronization of the signal source and the spatial delay
    of audio reproduction. IEC TS 62312-2:2018 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2007. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) fingerprint is newly introduced;<br />\r\nb) addition of
    the synchronization information from fingerprint (SMPTE spec.);<br />\r\nc) addition
    of the method for using the above information."
