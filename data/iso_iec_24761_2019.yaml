abstract:
- content: "This document defines the structure and the data elements of Authentication
    Context for Biometrics (ACBio), which is used for checking the validity of the
    result of a biometric enrolment and verification process executed at a remote
    site. This document allows any ACBio instance to accompany any biometric processes
    related to enrolment and verification. The specification of ACBio is applicable
    not only to single modal biometric enrolment and verification but also to multimodal
    fusion. The real-time information of presentation attack detection is not provided
    in this document. Only the assurance information of presentation attack detection
    (PAD) mechanism can be contained in the BPU report.<br />\r\nBiometric identification
    is out of the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document specifies the cryptographic
    syntax of an ACBio instance. The cryptographic syntax of an ACBio instance is
    defined in this document applying a data structure specified in Cryptographic
    Message Syntax (CMS) schema whose concrete values can be represented using a compact
    binary encoding. This document does not define protocols to be used between entities
    such as BPUs, claimant, and validator. Its concern is entirely with the content
    and encoding of the ACBio instances for the various processing activities."
