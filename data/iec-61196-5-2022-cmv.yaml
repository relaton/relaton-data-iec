  content: "IEC 61196-5:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61196-5:2022 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61196-5:2018
    edition 3.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 46A experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61196-5:2022, which is a sectional specification, applies
    to coaxial cables for analogue and digital one- and two-way signal transmission,
    for example for cable networks for television signals, sound signals and interactive
    services in accordance with IEC 60728-1, IEC 60728-1-1, IEC 60728-101, IEC 60728-10,
    ISO/IEC 11801-1 and ISO/IEC 11801-4. This includes also the transmission of BCT
    signals provided by a CATV, MATV or SMATV cable networks.<br />\r\nThis document
    specifies the test procedures and requirements for trunk and distribution cables
    for temperatures between −40 °C and +65 °C and in the frequency range of 5 MHz
    to 2 000 MHz.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2018. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na. complete revision;\r\n<div style=\"text-align:justify\">b.
