  content: ISO TS 22292:2021 This document provides guidance for sample preparation,
    data acquisition by transmission electron microscopy, data processing, and three-dimensional
    image reconstruction to measure size and shape parameters of nano-objects on rod-shaped
    supports. The method is applicable to samples dispersed on or within an electron-transparent
    rod-shaped support.
