abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO 30137 series is applicable to the use of biometrics in VSS
    (also known as Closed Circuit Television or CCTV systems) for a number of scenarios,
    including real-time operation against watchlists and in post event analysis of
    video data. In most cases, the biometric mode of choice will be face recognition,
    but this document also provides guidance for other modalities such as gait recognition.</p><p>This
    document:</p><p>— defines the key terms for use in the specification of biometric
    technologies in a VSS, including metrics for defining performance;</p><p>— provides
    guidance on selection of camera types, placement of cameras, image specification
    etc. for the operation of a biometric recognition capability in conjunction with
    a VSS;</p><p>— provides guidance on the composition of the gallery (or watchlist)
    against which facial images from the VSS are compared, including the selection
    of appropriate images of sufficient quality, and the size of the gallery in relation
    to performance requirements;</p><p>— makes recommendations on data formats for
    facial images and other relevant information (including metadata) obtained from
    video footage, used in watchlist images, or from observations made by human operators;</p><p>—
    establishes general principles for supporting the operator of the VSS, including
    user interfaces and processes to ensure efficient and effective operation, and
    highlights the need to have suitably trained personnel;</p><p>— highlights the
    need for robust governance processes to provide assurance that the implemented
    security, privacy and personal data protection measures specific to the use of
    biometric technologies with a VSS (e.g. internationally recognizable signage)
    are fit for purpose, and that societal considerations are reflected in the deployed
    system.</p><p>This document also provides information on related recognition and
    detection tasks in a VSS such as:</p><p>— estimation of crowd densities;</p><p>—
    determining patterns of movement of individuals;</p><p>— identification of individuals
    appearing in more than one camera;</p><p>— use of other biometric modalities such
    as gait or iris;</p><p>— use of specialized software to infer attributes of individuals,
    e.g. estimation of gender and age;</p><p>— interfaces to other related functionality,
    e.g. video analytics to measure queue lengths or to alert for abandoned baggage.</p>"
