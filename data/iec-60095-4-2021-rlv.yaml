    is applicable to lead-acid batteries used for starting, lighting and ignition
    of heavy trucks, commercial vehicles, busses and agricultural trucks. The object
    of this document is to specify global requirements of the main dimensions of starter
    batteries for Europe, North America and East Asia. This document comprises 12
    types of \"preferred types\" of batteries. This document specifies dimensions
    of 4 types of batteries each for Europe (types A, B, C and D2), North America
    (types 4D, 8D, 31T, 31A) and East Asia (types E41, F51, G51, H52)."
