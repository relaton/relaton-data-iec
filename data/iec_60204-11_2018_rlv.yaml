abstract:
- content: "IEC 60204-11:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60204-11:2018
    applies to electrical and electronic equipment and systems to machines, including
    a group of machines working together in a co-ordinated manner, which operate at
    nominal voltages above 1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC and not exceeding 36 kV AC or
    DC with nominal frequencies not exceeding 60 Hz. IEC 60204-11:2018 cancels and
    replaces the first edition, published in 2000. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition contains significant technical changes with respect to
    the previous edition regarding the following:<br />\r\n– aspects of risk assessment,
    which are mirrored from ISO 12100;<br />\r\n– equipotential bonding and earthing;<br
    />\r\n– EMC and power quality;<br />\r\n– HV switchgear and controlgear;<br />\r\n–
    creepage distances for conductors and slip-ring assemblies;<br />\r\n– a list
    of machinery using HV equipment, in Annex A.<br />\r\nIEC 60204-11:2018 has been
    updated and improved to reflect the experience gained with the first edition and
    the evolution of high-voltage equipment reflected in the relevant standards. Regarding
    formal requirements, IEC 60204-11 has been aligned with<br />\r\n– IEC 60204-1:2016,<br
    />\r\n– IEC 61936-1:2010 and IEC 61936-1:2010/AMD1:2014,<br />\r\n– IEC 62271
    (all parts). This document is intended to be used in conjunction with IEC 60204-1."
