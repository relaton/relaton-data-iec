    <p>ISO/IEC 24713-1:2008 provides common definitions used within the profile standards and references other standards applicable to the successful implementation of a generic biometric system.  </p>
    <p>A harmonized (with the other part 1 standards in WG 3 and WG5) generic biometric system is described and a diagram is present.  The description includes detail of the individual components present in a generic biometric system.  </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24713-1:2008 furthermore describes the generic functions of the biometric system and the relationship between a biometric system and the application that uses that system.  </p>
    <p>Lastly, ISO/IEC 24713-1:2008 details the possible interfaces into a biometric system as well as the relationship that exists between the various base standards currently under development within SC37.</p>
