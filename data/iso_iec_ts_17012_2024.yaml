abstract:
- content: "This document provides guidance on the use of remote auditing methods
    in auditing management systems. It is applicable to all organizations that plan
    and conduct all kinds of internal or external audits (i.e. first-party, second-party
    and third-party audits) of management systems.<br />\r\nThis document supports
    the general principles of auditing given in ISO 19011:2018 and provides further
    guidance on specific conditions, possibilities and limitations for implementing
    remote auditing methods.<br />\r\nThis document is intended to strengthen confidence
    in the use of remote auditing methods for auditing management systems among customers,
    regulators, accreditation bodies, certification bodies, scheme owners, industry,
    employees, consumers, suppliers and other interested parties.<br />\r\nThe use
    of remote auditing methods for auditing management systems is not intended to
    replace on-site audit methods. Instead, remote auditing methods are intended to
    serve as a tool to effectively and efficiently conduct the audit.<br />\r\nNOTE
    This document can be used for other types of audits and assessments."
