abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-105:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 62271-105:2021 applies to
    three-pole units for public and industrial distribution systems which are functional
    assemblies of switches composed of switches or switch-disconnectors and current-limiting
    fuses designed so as to be capable of<br />\r\n- breaking, at the rated voltage,
    any current up to and including the rated short-circuit breaking current;<br />\r\n-
    making, at the rated voltage, circuits to which the rated short-circuit breaking
    current applies.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- the document has been updated to be in alignment
    with the second edition of IEC 62271-1:2017;<br />\r\n- rated TRV has been removed
    (TRV is only a test parameter), as in the latest revision of IEC 62271-100;<br
    />\r\n- differentiation has been introduced between requirements expressed for
    fulfilling the function expected from a switch-fuse combination, from requirements
    only relevant when the function is performed by a stand-alone device. The goal
    is to avoid duplication or conflicts of requirements with a standard dealing with
    assemblies, when the function is implemented within such an assembly.</p>"
