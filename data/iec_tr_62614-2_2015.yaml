abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62614-2:2015(E) which is a Technical Report, is intended to show
    the background of encircled flux for the characterization of multimode launch
    conditions. This includes the selection of the encircled flux and the definition
    of the encircled flux requirements in conjunction with the implied variation for
    all multimode attenuation and return loss measurement methods on graded index
    multimode fibre products. This first edition cancels and replaces IEC TR 61282-11
    published in 2012. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- significant reduction to the clause on uncertainties;<br />\r\n-
    technical edits throughout in addition to updates to key normative references;<br
    />\r\n- incorporation of additional figures related to the wavelength bias between
    850 nm and 1 300 nm as well as the encircled flux limit of 10 Gigabit Ethernet
    VCSELs. This publication contains an attached file titled, \"TR 62614-2 Supplemental
    Data\", in the form of an Excel spreadsheet. This file is intended to be used
    as a complement and does not form an integral part of this Technical Report. Keywords:
    encircled flux, multimode launch conditions"
