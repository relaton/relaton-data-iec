  content: IEC 624811-3:2017(E) specifies guidelines for accessing content in the
    cloud, that is, outside of the home by devices in the home. These Guidelines focus
    on the discovery, association, and control of Apps capable of augmenting DLNA
    devices with the ability to consume content from sources outside the home. The
    basic support is realized with the UPnP ApplicationManagement Service.
