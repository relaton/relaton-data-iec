abstract:
- content: "IEC 61196-1-108:2025 applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies
    test methods for determining the phase, phase constant, phase and group delay,
    propagation velocity, electrical length, and mean characteristic impedance of
    coaxial cables for use in communications systems.<br />\r\nA procedure to measure
    phase dispersion of coaxial cable is included as Annex A.<br />\r\nThis third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2011. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    Change of title, \"phase and phase constant\" was added.<br />\r\nb) Clause 6,
    \"Preparation of test sample (TS)\" was added.<br />\r\nc) Clause 7, \"Test procedure\"
    was added.<br />\r\nd) Clause 8, \"Failure criterion\" was added.<br />\r\ne)
    Clause 9, \"Information to be given in the relevant specification\" was added."
