abstract:
- content: IEC TR 63410:2023, which is a Technical Report, aims to prepare a road
    map for categorizing Decentralized Electrical Energy Systems and identifying gaps
    in the existing standards relevant to Decentralized Electrical Energy Systems.
    The task of IEC Subcommittee 8B is to develop IEC publications enabling the development
    of secure, reliable and cost-effective systems with decentralized management for
    electrical energy supply, which are alternative, complementary or precursors to
    traditional large interconnected and highly centralized systems. This includes
    but is not limited to AC, DC, AC/DC hybrid decentralized electrical energy system,
    such as distributed generation, distributed energy storage, dispatchable loads,
    virtual power plants and electrical energy systems having interaction with multiple
    types of distributed energy resources.
