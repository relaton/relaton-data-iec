abstract:
- content: describes the recommended steps to complete a loop check which comprises
    the activities between the completion of loop construction (including installation
    and point-to-point checks) and the start-up of the cold commissioning. This document
    is applicable for the construction of new plants and for expansion/retrofits (i.e.
    revamping) of E&I installations in existing plants (including PLC, BAS, DCS, Panel-mounted
    and field instrumentation). It does not include a detailed checkout of power distribution
    systems except as they relate to the loops being checked (i. e. a motor starter
    or a power supply to a 4-wire transmitter).
