  content: IEC TS 62941:2016(E) provides more confidence in the ongoing consistency
    of performance and reliability of certified PV modules. The requirements of this
    technical specification are defined with the assumption that the quality management
    system of the organization has already fulfilled the requirements of a quality
    management system. By maintaining a manufacturing system in accordance with this
    guideline, PV modules are expected to maintain their performance as determined
    from the test sequences in IEC 61215, IEC 61646, or IEC 62108. This technical
    specification is applicable to all PV modules independent of design and technology
    i.e. flat panel, concentrator photovoltaic (CPV). This technical specification
    lays out best practices for product design, manufacturing processes, and selection
    and control of materials used in the manufacture of PV modules that have met the
    requirements of IEC 61215, IEC 61646, or IEC 62108.
