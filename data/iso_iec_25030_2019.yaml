abstract:
- content: "<p>This document provides the framework for quality requirements for systems,
    software products and data, which includes concept of the quality requirements,
    and requirements and recommendations for the processes and methods to elicit,
    define, use and govern them. Intended readers of this document include, but are
    not limited to:</p><p>— acquirers: evaluate if the system/software products/data
    fulfills their value proposition, i.e., meets the expected quality,</p><p>— developers:
    design, implement and test the system/software products/data to ensure that it
    meets the expected quality,</p><p>— testers: verify and validate that the system/software
    products/data meets the expected quality,</p><p>— project managers: plan, monitor
    and control the achievement of the expected quality, and</p><p>— independent evaluators:
    evaluate the system/software products/data with the objective criteria.</p><p>This
    document complies with the technical processes defined in ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288,
    which are relevant for elicitation of stakeholders' quality needs and for defining,
    analyzing and maintaining quality requirements. In this document, the quality
    models in ISO/IEC 25010 and ISO/IEC 25012 are used to categorize quality requirements
    and to provide a basis for quantifying them in terms of quality measures in the
    quality measure division of ISO/IEC 2502n.</p><p>This document does not cover
    specification of the other requirements (such as functional requirements, process
    requirements, etc.), and prescribes neither any specific quality measure nor any
    specific development process.</p>"
