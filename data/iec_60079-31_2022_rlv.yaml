abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-31:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60079-31:2022
    is applicable to equipment protected by enclosure and surface temperature limitation
    for use in explosive dust atmospheres. It specifies requirements for design, construction
    and testing of Ex Equipment and Ex Components. This document supplements and modifies
    the general requirements of IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement of this document
    conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the requirement of this document
    takes precedence. This document does not apply to dusts of explosives, which do
    not require atmospheric oxygen for combustion, or to pyrophoric substances. This
    document does not apply to Ex Equipment or Ex Components intended for use in underground
    parts of mines as well as those parts of surface installations of such mines endangered
    by firedamp and/or combustible dust. This document does not take account of any
    risk due to an emission of flammable or toxic gas from the dust. This third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. Main significant changes from the previous edition are:<br
    />\r\n1) Document has been restructured from edition 2<br />\r\n2) Fault current
    rating of interrupting contacts in clauses 4.3.1 and 4.4.1, major change type
    C1<br />\r\n3) Cells and batteries in clauses 4.3.5.1 and 4.4.5.1, major change
    type C2<br />\r\n4) Overload or malfunction condition for the determination of
    temperature class for \"tb\" converter fed rotating electric machines, major change
    type C3<br />\r\n5) Additional requirements for entry devices with dust ignition
    protection by enclosure \"t\", major change type C4<br />\r\nInformation about
    the background of ‘Major Technical Changes’<br />\r\nC1 – Ex Equipment having
    Level of Protection \"ta\" shall be rated for connection to a circuit with a prospective
    short circuit current of not greater than 1.5 kA. For Ex Equipment having Level
    of Protection \"tb\" or \"tc\" which is intended for mains connection and intended
    to interrupt fault current above 10kA, the equipment shall have a rated maximum
    short circuit withstand current, be tested according to 6.1.1.1, and be marked
    according to Clause 7.<br />\r\nC2 – For Ex Equipment having Level of Protection
    \"ta\" which contains a cell or battery, only a sealed cell or battery shall be
    used. For Ex Equipment having Level of Protection \"tb\" and \"tc\" where there
    are sparking contacts or hot surfaces, and which contains a cell or battery, only
    a sealed cell or battery shall be used.<br />\r\nC3 – Table 2 now includes malfunction
    conditions for temperature class determination of Level of Protection \"tb\" converter-fed
    electric machines.<br />\r\nC4 – Annex A added for entry devices with Type of
    Protection \"t\" including cable transit devices."
