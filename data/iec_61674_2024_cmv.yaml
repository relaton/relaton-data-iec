abstract:
- content: "IEC 61674:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61674:2024 edition 3.0 and the previous IEC 61674:2012
    edition 2.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC SC 62C experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 61674:2024 specifies the performance and some related constructional
    requirements of DIAGNOSTIC DOSIMETERS intended for the measurement of AIR KERMA,
    AIR KERMA LENGTH PRODUCT or AIR KERMA RATE, in photon radiation fields used in
    medical X-ray imaging, such as RADIOGRAPHY, RADIOSCOPY and COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY
    (CT), for X-RADIATION with generating potentials in the range of 20 kV to 150
    kV. This document is applicable to the performance of DOSIMETERS with VENTED IONIZATION
    CHAMBERS and/or SEMICONDUCTOR DETECTORS as used in X-ray diagnostic imaging.<br
    />\r\nIEC 61674:2024 cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) for mammography, the manufacturer specifies the REFERENCE VALUE for the
    RADIATION QUALITY;<br />\r\nb) for mammography, the manufacturer provides the
    MINIMUM RATED RANGE of RADIATION QUALITIES for the compliance test on energy dependence
    of response;<br />\r\nc) the compliance test for analogue displays was removed;<br
    />\r\nd) the compliance tests for range reset, the effect of leakage and recombination
    losses were removed. These tests are already covered by the test on linearity
    and cannot be conducted for modern devices. The estimation of COMBINED STANDARD
    UNCERTAINTY was changed accordingly;<br />\r\ne) the compliance test for mains
    rechargeable and battery-operated dosimeters were updated for modern devices"
