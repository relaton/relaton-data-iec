abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19788-4:2014 specifies, in a rule-based manner, metadata elements
    and their attributes for the description of learning resources. This includes
    the rules governing the identification of metadata elements and the specification
    of metadata attributes.</p><p>These metadata elements are used to form the description
    of a learning resource, i.e. as a metadata learning resource (MLR) record.</p><p>This
    part of ISO/IEC 19788 specifies, using ISO/IEC 19788-1, technical aspects of learning
    resources, i.e., requirements for use, location, size, etc.</p>"
