abstract:
- content: IEC TS 61463:2016(E), which is a Technical Specification, is applicable
    to alternating current and direct current bushings for highest voltages above
    52 kV (or with resonance frequencies placed inside the seismic response spectrum),
    mounted on transformers, other apparatus or buildings. For bushings with highest
    voltages less than or equal to 52 kV (or with resonance frequencies placed outside
    from the seismic response spectrum), due to their characteristics, seismic qualification
    is not used as far as construction practice and seismic construction practice
    comply with the state of the art. This document presents acceptable seismic qualification
    methods and requirements to demonstrate that a bushing can maintain its mechanical
    properties, insulate and carry current during and after an earthquake. The seismic
    qualification of a bushing is only performed upon request.
