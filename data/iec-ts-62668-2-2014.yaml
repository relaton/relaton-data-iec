  content: "IEC TS 62668-2:2014(en) defines requirements for avoiding the use of counterfeit,
    recycled and fraudulent components when these components are purchased outside
    of franchised distributor networks for use in the aerospace, defence and high
    performance (ADHP) industries. This practice is used, as derogation, only when
    there are no reasonable or practical alternatives. Although developed for the
    ADHP industry, this document may be used by other high-performance and high-reliability
    industries, at their discretion.\r\n<br /><br />This publication is to be read
