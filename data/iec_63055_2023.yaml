abstract:
- content: IEC 63055:2023 defines a common interoperable format that will be used
    for the design of a) large-scale integration (LSI), b) packages for such LSI,
    and c) printed circuit boards on which the packaged LSIs are interconnected. Collectively,
    such designs are referred to as LSI-Package-Board (LPB) designs. The format provides
    a common way to specify information/data about the project management, netlists,
    components, design rules, and geometries used in LPB designs. This is an IEC/IEEE
    dual logo standard.
