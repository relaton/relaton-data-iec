    <p>This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of an 80 mm and a 120 mm DVD -</p>
    <p>Recordable disk to enable the interchange of such disks. It specifies the quality of the pre-recorded, unrecorded and the</p>
    <p>recorded signals, the format of the data, the format of the information zone, the format of the unrecorded zone, and the</p>
    <p>recording method, thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. This disk is identified as a DVD -</p>
    <p>Recordable (DVD-R) disk. Once data has been recorded on a DVD-R disk it cannot be modified. It can be read many times.</p>
    <p>Further data may be appended.</p>
    <p>This International Standard specifies</p>
    <p>? 80 mm and 120 mm nominal diameter disks that may be either single or double sided,</p>
    <p>? the conditions for conformance,</p>
    <p>? the environments in which the disk is to be operated and stored,</p>
    <p>? the mechanical and physical characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data processing</p>
    <p>systems,</p>
    <p>? the format of the pre-recorded information on an unrecorded disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and</p>
    <p>sectors, the error correcting codes and the coding method used,</p>
    <p>? the format of the data and the recorded information on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors,</p>
    <p>the error correcting codes and the coding method used,</p>
    <p>? the characteristics of the signals from pre-recorded and unrecorded areas on the disk, enabling data processing systems to</p>
    <p>read the pre-recorded information and to write to the disks,</p>
    <p>? the characteristics of the signals recorded on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the data from the disk.</p>
    <p>This International Standard provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard for volume and file</p>
    <p>structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing systems.</p>
