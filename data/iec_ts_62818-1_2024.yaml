abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62818-1:2024 establishes a system of fiber reinforced composite
    core used as supporting member material in conductors for overhead lines which
    may be used as the basis for specifications. This document is applicable to fiber
    reinforced composite core, with polymeric matrix, used as supporting member material
    in conductors for overhead lines.<br />\r\nThis document gives guidance on:<br
    />\r\n- defining the common terms used for fiber reinforced composite core with
    polymeric matrix,<br />\r\n- prescribing common methods and recommendations to
    characterize the properties of fiber reinforced composite core based on single
    or multi-wires with PMC (Polymeric Matrix Composite) used as supporting member
    material in conductors,<br />\r\n- prescribing or recommending acceptance or failure
    criteria when applicable.<br />\r\nThese tests, criteria and recommendations are
    intended to ensure a satisfactory use and quality under normal operating and environmental
    conditions.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to compliance criteria which
    may be required but indicative values could be given in Annexes for guidance."
