  content: "IEC 62077:2022 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62077:
    2022 applies to circulators used in the field of fibre optics bearing all of the
    following features:<br />\r\n- they are non-reciprocal optical devices, in which
    each port is either an optical fibre or fibre optic connector;<br />\r\n- they
    are passive devices in accordance with the categorization and definition provided
    in IEC TS 62538;<br />\r\n- they have three or more ports for directionally transmitting
    optical power.<br />\r\nAn example of optical circulator technology and application
    is described in Annex A and Annex B, respectively. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition published in 2015. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- harmonization of terms and definitions
    with IEC TS 62627-09;<br />\r\n- change of Clause 4 regarding requirements"
