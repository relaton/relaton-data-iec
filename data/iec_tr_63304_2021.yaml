abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63304:2021(E) describes the general principle and technical details
    of the methods of measurement of the DC magnetic properties of permanent magnet
    materials in an open magnetic circuit using a superconducting magnet (SCM).<br
    />\r\nThis method is applicable to permanent magnet materials, such as those specified
    in IEC 60404-8-1, the properties of which are presumed homogeneous throughout
    their volume.<br />\r\nThere are two methods:<br />\r\n– the SCM-Vibrating Sample
    Magnetometer (VSM) method;<br />\r\n– the SCM-Extraction method.<br />\r\nThis
    document also describes methods to correct the influence of the self-demagnetizing
    field in the test specimen on the demagnetization curve measured in an open magnetic
    circuit. The magnetic properties are determined from the corrected demagnetization
    curve.<br />\r\nNOTE These SCM-methods can determine the magnetic properties of
    permanent magnet materials with coercivity higher than 2 MA/m. The methods of
    measurement in a closed magnetic circuit specified in IEC 60404-5 can lead to
    significant measurement error due to saturation effects in the pole pieces of
    yoke for the magnetic materials with coercivity higher than 1,6 MA/m (see IEC
    60404-5)."
