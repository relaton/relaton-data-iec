abstract:
- content: IEC 60079-25:2020+AMD1:2025 CSV contains the specific requirements for
    design, construction and assessment of intrinsically safe systems, Type of Protection
    “i”, intended for use, as a whole or in part, in locations in which the use of
    Group I, II or III Ex Equipment is required. This document supplements and modifies
    the general requirements of IEC 60079-0 and the intrinsic safety standard IEC
    60079-11. Where a requirement of this standard conflicts with a requirement of
    IEC 60079-0 or IEC 60079-11, the requirement of this standard takes precedence.
    The installation requirements of Group II or Group III systems designed in accordance
    with this standard are specified in IEC 60079-14. This third edition cancels and
    replaces the second edition published in 2010 and constitutes a technical revision.
    The contents of the corrigendum 1 of October 2020 and corrigendum 2 of November
    2022 have been included in this copy.
