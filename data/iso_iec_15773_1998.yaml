abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the signaling protocol for the
    support of the Transit Counter additional network feature (ANF-TC) at the Q reference
    point between Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected
    together within a Broadband Private Integrated Services Network (B-PISN).</p><p>ANF-TC
    is a feature that limits the number of Transit PINXs that a call/connection setup
    request may be routed through e.g., to protect the network against indefinite
    looping.</p><p>The Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p><p>Service
    specifications are produced in three stages and according to the method specified
    in CCITT Rec. I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification
    for the Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage
    1 and stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15055.</p><p>The signaling protocol for
    ANF-TC operates in association with the signaling protocols for basic call/connection
    control (as specified in ISO/IEC 13247) and call independent (connection oriented)
    signaling connections (as specified in ECMA-254).</p><p>This International Standard
    is applicable to PINXs that can interconnect to form a PISN.</p>"
