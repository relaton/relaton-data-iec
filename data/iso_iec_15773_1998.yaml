abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the signaling protocol for the support of the
    Transit Counter additional network feature (ANF-TC) at the Q reference point between
    Private Integrated Services Network Exchanges (PINXs) connected together within
    a Broadband Private Integrated Services Network (B-PISN).<br />\r\nANF-TC is a
    feature that limits the number of Transit PINXs that a call/connection setup request
    may be routed through e.g., to protect the network against indefinite looping.<br
    />\r\nThe Q reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.<br />\r\nService specifications
    are produced in three stages and according to the method specified in CCITT Rec.
    I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 3 specification for the
    Q reference point and satisfies the requirements identified by the stage 1 and
    stage 2 specifications in ISO/IEC 15055.<br />\r\nThe signaling protocol for ANF-TC
    operates in association with the signaling protocols for basic call/connection
    control (as specified in ISO/IEC 13247) and call independent (connection oriented)
    signaling connections (as specified in ECMA-254).<br />\r\nThis International
    Standard is applicable to PINXs that can interconnect to form a PISN."
