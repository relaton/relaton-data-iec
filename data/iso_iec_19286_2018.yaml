abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19286:2018 aims to normalize privacy-enhancing protocols and
    services by</p><p>- using the mechanisms from parts of ISO/IEC 7816 and parts
    of ISO/IEC 18328 that contribute to security and privacy,</p><p>- providing discoverability
    means of privacy-enabling attributes,</p><p>- defining requirements for attribute-based
    credential handling, and</p><p>- identifying data objects and commands for ICCs.</p><p>Existing
    privacy-enhancing protocols available in a generic context are adopted for distributed
    systems including ICCs. Additionally, existing authentication protocols between
    an ICC and an external device used for establishing a secure channel are enhanced
    with privacy protection. Secure communication between an ICC and an on-card device
    is also considered.</p><p>All the protocols and services described in this document
    contribute to privacy. Annex B describes an example of privacy impact assessments
    of respective systems.</p>"
