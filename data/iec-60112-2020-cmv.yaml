  content: "IEC 60112:2020 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60112:2020 edition 5.0 and the previous edition IEC
    60112:2003+AMD1:2009 CSV edition 4.1. Futhermore, comments from IEC TC 112 experts
    are provided to explain the reasons of the most relevant changes.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nIEC 60112:2020 specifies the method of test for the determination of the
    proof and comparative tracking indices of solid insulating materials on pieces
    taken from parts of equipment and on plaques of material using alternating voltage.
    This document provides a procedure for the determination of erosion when required.\r\n<p>
    </p>\r\n\r\n<p>This test method evaluates the composition of the material as well
    as the surface of the material being evaluated. Both the composition and surface
    condition directly influence the results of the evaluation and are considered
    when using the results in material selection process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Test results
    are not directly suitable for the evaluation of safe creepage distances when designing
    electrical apparatus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This basic safety publication focusing on
    a safety test method is primarily intended for use by technical committees in
    the preparation of safety publications in accordance with the principles laid
    down in IEC Guide 104 and lSO/lEC Guide 51.</p>\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\nIntroduction
    of a new contaminant, solution C with a surfactant aligned with the test method
    of IEC 60587. The definition of the solution B was transferred to Annex B for
    backward reference.<br />\r\nIntroduction of a screening test, considering the
    fact that some materials can withstand high test voltages, but fail at lower test
    voltages.<br />\r\nIt has the status of a basic safety publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 104."
