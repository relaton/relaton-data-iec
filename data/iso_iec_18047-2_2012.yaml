    <p>ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012 defines test methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification (RFID) devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given in ISO/IEC 18000-2, but does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory or similar requirements.</p><p>The test methods require only that the mandatory functions, and any optional functions which are implemented, be verified. This may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific functionality criteria that are not available in the general case.</p><p>The interrogator and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012 are the following:</p>

    mode-specific conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;
    parameters that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.<p>The following are not included in ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012:</p>

    parameters that are already included in regulatory test requirements;
    high-level data encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).<p>Unless otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012 are to be applied exclusively to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-2.</p>
