abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012 defines test
    methods for determining the conformance of radio frequency identification (RFID)
    devices (tags and interrogators) for item management with the specifications given
    in ISO/IEC 18000-2, but does not apply to the testing of conformity with regulatory
    or similar requirements.</p><p>The test methods require only that the mandatory
    functions, and any optional functions which are implemented, be verified. This
    may, in appropriate circumstances, be supplemented by further, application-specific
    functionality criteria that are not available in the general case.</p><p>The interrogator
    and tag conformance parameters in ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012 are the following:</p><ul><li>mode-specific
    conformance parameters including nominal values and tolerances;</li><li>parameters
    that apply directly affecting system functionality and inter-operability.</li></ul><p>The
    following are not included in ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012:</p><ul><li>parameters that
    are already included in regulatory test requirements;</li><li>high-level data
    encoding conformance test parameters (these are specified in ISO/IEC 15962).</li></ul><p>Unless
    otherwise specified, the tests in ISO/IEC 18047-2:2012 are to be applied exclusively
    to RFID tags and interrogators defined in ISO/IEC 18000-2.</p>
