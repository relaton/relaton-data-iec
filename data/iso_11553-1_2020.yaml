abstract:
- content: "This document describes laser radiation hazards arising in laser processing
    machines, as defined in 3.7. It also specifies the safety requirements relating
    to laser radiation hazards, as well as the information to be supplied by the manufacturers
    of such equipment (in addition to that prescribed by IEC 60825).<br />\r\nRequirements
    dealing with noise as a hazard from laser processing machines are included in
    ISO 11553â€‘3:2013.<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to machines using laser
    radiation to process materials.<br />\r\nIt is not applicable to laser products,
    or equipment containing such products, which are manufactured solely and expressly
    for the following applications:<br />\r\n- photolithography;<br />\r\n- stereolithography;<br
    />\r\n- holography;<br />\r\n- medical applications (per IEC 60601-2-22);<br />\r\n-
