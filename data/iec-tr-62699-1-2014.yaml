  content: "IEC TR 62699-1:2014 describes mapping rules and exchange methods for the
    development of general and extendable integrated services utilizing heterogeneous
    multi-national or multi-enterprise electronic parts library data. The scope of
    this technical report is as follows:<br />\r\na) identification and classification
    of mapping types for mapping heterogeneous electronic parts libraries;<br />\r\nb)
    definition of general mapping rules and specific mapping rules commonly applying
    to various mapping types.<br />\r\nThe following aspects are out of the scope
    of this technical report:<br />\r\n- schematic definition and management of the
    electronic parts libraries to be mapped;<br />\r\n- maintenance process for the
    parts libraries during changes."
