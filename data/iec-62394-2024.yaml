  content: "IEC 62394:2024 specifies requirements for service diagnostic software
    to be implemented in products that incorporate a digital interface. It does not
    specify requirements for carrying out remote diagnosis or for manufacturer-dependent
    software.<br />\r\nThe Service Diagnostic Interface (SDI) requires an external
    controller (exclusive or general-purpose/PC) into which service diagnostic software
    can be loaded. Parts of the controller software are standardized while other parts
    are proprietary to the manufacturers.<br />\r\nTo reach a common approach in servicing
    all products from all manufacturers, it is necessary to standardize specific items
    to be tested in products and certain aspects of controllers' diagnostic software.<br
    />\r\nThe SDI is based upon ECHONET specification version 2.11, ECHONET Lite specification
    version 1.13, and APPENDIX Detailed Requirements for ECHONET Device objects Release
    Q rev. 1, because this interface will be used in future products. The use of this
    connection and existing communication protocols enable implementation in products
    at a low cost, with maximum flexibility and efficiency.<br />\r\nThe SDI consists
    of<br />\r\n• specific hardware and software requirements of the device under
    test (DUT);<br />\r\n• specific requirements of the controller:<br />\r\n– the
    service software;<br />\r\n– an ECHONET interface;<br />\r\n• the connection between
    the controller and the DUT.<br />\r\nThis document provides the minimal requirements
    necessary to carry out computerized diagnosis. It covers the standardized software
    of the controller as well as the standardized software and provisions in the DUT.<br
    />\r\nIEC 62394:2024 cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2022.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) updates of the device object super class specifications for the property
    configurations shared by all device objects;<br />\r\nb) modification and addition
    of the property configurations defined by each object;<br />\r\nc) addition of
    new device objects and their property configurations;<br />\r\nd) updates to Bibliography."
