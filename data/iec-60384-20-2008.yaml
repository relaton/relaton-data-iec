    Is applicable to fixed surface mount capacitors for direct current, with metallized electrodes and polyphenylene sulfide dielectric for use in electronic equipment. These capacitors have metallized connecting pads or soldering strips and are intended to be mounted directly onto substrates for hybrid circuits or onto printed boards. These capacitors may have "self healing properties" depending on conditions of use. They are primarily intended for applications where the a.c. component is small with respect to the rated voltage.
