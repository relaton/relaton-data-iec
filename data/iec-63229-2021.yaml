  content: IEC 63229:2021(E) gives guidelines for the definition and classification
    of defects in GaN epitaxial film grown on SiC substrate. They are identified and
    described on the basis of examples, mainly by schematic illustrations, optical
    microscope images, and transmission electron microscope images for these defects.
    This document covers only defects in as-grown GaN epitaxial film on SiC substrate
    and does not include defects caused by subsequent processes.
