abstract:
- content: "IEC 60684-3-280:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 69684-3-280:2019
    gives the requirements for heat-shrinkable, polyolefin sleeving, anti-tracking
    with a nominal shrink ratio of 3:1. This sleeving has been found suitable for
    use at temperatures up to 100 °C. Typically: medium wall, internal diameter up
    to 110 mm. This sleeving is normally supplied in the colours red or brown. Since
    these types of sleeving cover a significantly large range of sizes and wall thicknesses,
    Annex A (Table A.1) provides guidance on the range of sizes available. The actual
    size will be agreed between the user and the supplier. Materials which conform
    to this specification meet established levels of performance. However, the selection
    of a material by a user for a specific application will be based on the actual
    requirements necessary for adequate performance in that application and not based
    on this specification alone. This sleeving is designed to be used in medium voltage
    cable accessories and as such electrical performance willbe proven as part of
    the assembly. Examples of this are described in HD 629.1 and IEC 60502 (all parts).
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2010 and
    Amendment 1:2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- change of moulded plaque thickness for resistance to tracking
    and weathering tests to (6 ± 0,5) mm.<br />\r\nKeywords: Heat-shrinkable, polyolefin
    sleeving, anti-tracking"
