abstract:
- content: "IEC 60068-2-78:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60068-2-78:2025
    establishes a test method for determining the ability of components or equipment
    to withstand transportation, storage and use under conditions of high humidity.
    The object of this document is to investigate the effect of high humidity at constant
    temperature without condensation on a specimen over a specified period. It is
    applicable to small equipment or components as well as large equipment and can
    be applied to both heat-dissipating and non-heat-dissipating specimens. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2012. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    revision of the requirements for the test chamber;<br />\r\nb) revision of the
    severities and including the dew point temperatures;<br />\r\nc) change of the
    temperature tolerances of the test to limits;<br />\r\nd) inclusion of a specified
    preconditioning procedure;<br />\r\ne) inclusion of a new figure for clarification
    purposes;<br />\r\nf) revision of standardized requirements for the test report."
