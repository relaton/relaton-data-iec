abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO/IEC 15938 series operates on and generates conformant bitstreams.
    This document provides a specific implementation that behaves in a conformant
    manner.</p><p>NOTE 1 Other implementations that conform to the ISO/IEC 15938 series
    are possible, which do not necessarily use the algorithms or the programming techniques
    of the reference software.</p><p>The software contained in this document is known
    as eXperimentation Model (XM) and is divided into five categories:</p><p>a) Binary
    format for MPEG-7 (BiM). This software converts DDL (XML) based descriptions to
    binary format and vice versa as explained in Clause 5.</p><p>b) DDL parser and
    DDL validation parser. The components of this software module are specified in
    Clause 6.</p><p>c) Visual descriptors. This software creates standard visual descriptions
    from associated (visual) media content as explained in Clause 7.</p><p>NOTE 2
    The techniques used for extracting descriptors are informative, and the quality
    and complexity of these extraction tools has not been optimized.</p><p>d) Audio
    descriptors. This software creates standard descriptions from associated (audio)
    media content as explained in Clause 8.</p><p>NOTE 3 The techniques used for extracting
    descriptors are informative, and the quality and complexity of these extraction
    tools has not been optimized.</p><p>e) Multimedia description schemes. This software
    modules provide standard descriptions of multimedia description schemes as specified
    in Clause 9.</p>"
