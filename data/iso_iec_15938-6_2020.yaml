abstract:
- content: "The ISO/IEC 15938 series operates on and generates conformant bitstreams.
    This document provides a specific implementation that behaves in a conformant
    manner.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Other implementations that conform to the ISO/IEC 15938
    series are possible, which do not necessarily use the algorithms or the programming
    techniques of the reference software.<br />\r\nThe software contained in this
    document is known as eXperimentation Model (XM) and is divided into five categories:<br
    />\r\na) Binary format for MPEG-7 (BiM). This software converts DDL (XML) based
    descriptions to binary format and vice versa as explained in Clause 5.<br />\r\nb)
    DDL parser and DDL validation parser. The components of this software module are
    specified in Clause 6.<br />\r\nc) Visual descriptors. This software creates standard
    visual descriptions from associated (visual) media content as explained in Clause
    7.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 The techniques used for extracting descriptors are informative,
    and the quality and complexity of these extraction tools has not been optimized.<br
    />\r\nd) Audio descriptors. This software creates standard descriptions from associated
    (audio) media content as explained in Clause 8.<br />\r\nNOTE 3 The techniques
    used for extracting descriptors are informative, and the quality and complexity
    of these extraction tools has not been optimized.<br />\r\ne) Multimedia description
    schemes. This software modules provide standard descriptions of multimedia description
    schemes as specified in Clause 9."
