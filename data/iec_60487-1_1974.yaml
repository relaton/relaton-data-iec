abstract:
- content: Gives standard conditions of measurement and methods of measuring the characteristics
    common to sub-systems of terrestrial line-of-sight radio-relay systems and to
    simulated radio-relay systems using frequency modulation. The tests described
    are limited to analogue transmission systems. Standardizes the conditions and
    methods of measurement to be used to ascertain the performance of terrestrial
    radio-relay systems and of the equipment used in such systems, and facilitates
    the comparison of the results of measurements made by different observers. Contains
    details of selected methods of making measurements to enable the assessment of
    the essential properties of a terrestrial radio-relay system and of the equipment
    used in such systems.
