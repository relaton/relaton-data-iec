abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 17040:2005 specifies the general requirements for the peer assessment
    process to be carried out by agreement groups of accreditation bodies or conformity
    assessment bodies. It addresses the structure and operation of the agreement group
    only insofar as they relate to the peer assessment process.ISO/IEC 17040:2005
    is not concerned with the wider issues of the arrangements for the formation,
    organization and management of the agreement group, and does not cover how the
    group will use peer assessment in deciding membership of the group. Such matters,
    which could for example include a procedure for applicants to appeal against decisions
    of the agreement group, are outside the scope of ISO/IEC 17040:2005.ISO/IEC 17040:2005
    is applicable to peer assessment of conformity assessment bodies performing activities
    such as testing, product certification, inspection, management system certification
    (sometimes also called registration), and personnel certification.More than one
    type of activity can be included in a peer assessment process. This can be considered
    particularly appropriate when the body under assessment conducts combined assessments
    of multiple conformity assessment activities.ISO/IEC 17040:2005 is also applicable
    to peer assessment amongst accreditation bodies, which is also known as peer evaluation.
