abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 26559:2017, within the context of the tools and methods of
    variability traceability for software and system product lines<strong>:</strong></p><p>-
    provides the terms and definitions specific to variability traceability for software
    and systems product lines;</p><p>- defines process groups and their processes
    for establishing and managing variability traceability at product line lifecycle
    processes. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and
    outcomes;</p><p>- defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of
    each process;</p><p>- defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks
    or defined method capabilities.</p><p>ISO/IEC 26559:2017 does not concern processes
    and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system but rather deals with
    those for a family of products.</p>"
