abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 26559:2017, within the context of the tools and methods of variability
    traceability for software and system product lines:<br />\r\n- provides the terms
    and definitions specific to variability traceability for software and systems
    product lines;<br />\r\n- defines process groups and their processes for establishing
    and managing variability traceability at product line lifecycle processes. Those
    processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks, and outcomes;<br />\r\n-
    defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;<br />\r\n-
    defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 26559:2017 does not concern processes and capabilities of tools
    and methods for a single system but rather deals with those for a family of products."
