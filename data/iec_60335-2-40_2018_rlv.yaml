abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-40:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-40:2018
    deals with the safety of electric heat pumps, including sanitary hot water heat
    pumps, air conditioners, and dehumidifiers incorporating motor-compressors and
    hydronic fan coils units, their maximum rated voltages being not more than 250
    V for single phase appliances and 600 V for all other appliances. Partial units
    are within the scope of this International Standard.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended
    for normal household use but which nevertheless may be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. The appliances referenced
    above may consist of one or more factory-made assemblies. If provided in more
    than one assembly, the separate assemblies are to be used together, and the requirements
    are based on the use of matched assemblies. This standard does not take into account
    refrigerants other than group A1, A2L, A2 and A3 as defined by ISO 817 classification,
    A2L refrigerants are limited to those of a molar mass of more than or equal to
    42 kg/kmol based on WCF – Worst Case Formulation as specified in ISO 817. This
    standard specifies particular requirements for the use of flammable refrigerants.
    Unless specifications are covered by this standard, including the annexes, requirements
    for refrigerating safety are covered by ISO 5149. Supplementary heaters, or a
    provision for their separate installation, are within the scope of this standard,
    but only heaters which are designed as a part of the appliance package, the controls
    being incorporated in the appliance. For appliances intended to be used in vehicles
    or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements may be necessary; for appliances
    subjected to pressure, additional requirements may be necessary; This standard
    does not apply to: humidifiers intended for use with heating and cooling equipment
    (IEC 60335-2-88); appliances designed exclusively for industrial processing or
    appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).
    This sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2013 and
    its Amendment 1:2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- Clause 1 – limiting A2L refrigerants to those of a molar mass
    of more than or equal to 42 kg/kmol;<br />\r\n- Clause 7 – added requirements
    for A2L refrigerants,<br />\r\n- Clause 7 – added requirement for pre-charge pipe
    sets, detection systems, ventilation and the resulting charge;<br />\r\n- Clause
    7 – added requirements for UV-C systems;<br />\r\n- Clause 7 – added requirements
    for transcritical refrigerating systems;<br />\r\n- Subclause 19.7 – amended text
    to match the intention of the subclause;<br />\r\n- Clause 21 – added requirements
    for transcritical refrigerating systems;<br />\r\n- Subclause 22 – added requirements
    for A2L refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Subclause 22– added detection systems;<br />\r\n-
    Subclause 22 – added new requirements for enhanced tightness refrigerating systems;<br
    />\r\n- Subclause 22 – added new requirements for UV-C;<br />\r\n- Clause 23 –
    added new requirements for UV-C;Clause<br />\r\n- Clause 24 – added requirements
    for transcritical refrigerating systems;<br />\r\n- Subclause 24 – added requirements
    for detection systems and airflow;<br />\r\n- Clause 32 added new requirements
    for UV-C;<br />\r\n- Annex BB – revised to add surface temperatures;<br />\r\n-
    Annex DD – added requirements for A2L refrigerants and amended requirements for
    flammable refrigerants to exempt A2L refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex GG – added
    requirements for A2L refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex GG.1 – amended Table GG.1
    and related wording<br />\r\n- Annex GG.7 – added requirement to test;<br />\r\n-
    Annex GG.8 to GG.13 – new coverage for A2L refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex HH –
    revised to take into account A2L refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex JJ – new coverage
    of allowable opening of relays and similar components to prevent ignition of A2L
    refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex KK – new coverage of test method for hot surface
    ignition temperature for A2L;<br />\r\n- Annex LL – new coverage of refrigerant
    detection systems for A2L Refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex MM – new coverage of
    refrigerant sensor location confirmation test;<br />\r\n- Annex NN – new coverage
    of flame arrest enclosure verification test for A2L refrigerants;<br />\r\n- Annex
    OO – new coverage of UV radiation conditioning<br />\r\n- Bibliography – added
    new references.<br />\r\nThis part 2-40 is to be used in conjunction with the
    latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the basis
    of IEC 60335-1:2010, its Amendment 1:2013 and its Amendment 2:2016."
