abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 18000 has been developed to provide a framework to define common
    communications protocols for Internationally useable frequencies for Radio Frequency
    Identification (RFID), and, where possible, to determine the use of the same protocols
    for all frequencies such that the problems of migrating from one to another are
    diminished; to minimize software and implementation costs; and to enable system
    management and control and information exchange to be common as far as is possible.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    18000-3:2008 was prepared in accordance with the requirements determined in ISO/IEC
    18000-1. ISO/IEC 18000-1 provides explanation of the concepts behind ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    18000-3:2008 has 2 MODES of operation, intended to address different applications.
    It summarizes the differences between MODE characteristics. The detailed technical
    differences between the modes are shown in the parameter tables.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    18000-3:2008 relates solely to systems operating at 13,56 MHz.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008
    provides physical layer, collision management system and protocol values for RFID
    systems for Item Identification operating at 13,56 MHz in accordance with the
    requirements of ISO/IEC 18000-1.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008 provides definitions
    for systems for each MODE determined in ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008.</p><p>ISO/IEC 18000-3:2008
    defines two non-interfering MODES.</p>\n\nThe MODES are not interoperable. \nThe
    MODES, whilst not interoperable, are non-interfering."
