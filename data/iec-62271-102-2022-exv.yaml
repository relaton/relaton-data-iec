  content: "IEC 62271-102:2022 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 62271-102:2022 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 62271-1:2017+AMD1:2021 CSV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62271-102:2018+AMD1:2022
    CSV applies to alternating current disconnectors and earthing switches, designed
    for indoor and outdoor installations for nominal voltages above 1 000 V and for
    service frequencies up to and including 60 Hz. This second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2001, Amendment 1:2011 and Amendment 2:2013.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na.
    new numbering according to IEC 17/1025/RQ to harmonize with ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 2, and IEEE Std. C37.100.1;<br />\r\nb. clause numbering has been aligned
    with IEC 62271-1:2017;<br />\r\nc. the Scope has been extended to cover all indoor
    and outdoor installations. Consideration of switching devices having disconnecting
    and/or earthing switch functionalities, apart from other functions, are also covered
    by this document;<br />\r\nd. ratings have been moved from Annexes B, C and E
    to Clause 5; the order of the subclauses now corresponds to the order of subclauses
    in Clause 7;<br />\r\ne. new rating values for bus-transfer current and bus-transfer
    voltage have been assigned;<br />\r\nf. new class of mechanical endurance for
    earthing switches has been added (M1);<br />\r\ng. subclause \"Rated values of
    electrical endurance for earthing switches\" is now called \"Classification of
    earthing switches for short-circuit making capability\";<br />\r\nh. new subclause
    with ratings for ice-coating has been added;<br />\r\ni. new subclause with classification
    of bus-charging switching capability has been added;<br />\r\nj. new withstand
    requirements for interlocking devices have been added;<br />\r\nk. the way to
    comply with the requirements of the isolating distance of disconnectors has been
    modified;<br />\r\nl. design and construction requirements for position-indicating
    devices have been modified, aligning the requirements for position indication
    and signalling;<br />\r\nm. the value of the operating force has been changed;<br
    />\r\nn. the test procedures and validation criteria have been revised and modified
    where necessary;<br />\r\no. requirements for applied voltage during single-phase
    test on non-simultaneous closing earthing switches have been changed;<br />\r\np.
    non-verifiable requirements have been deleted;<br />\r\nq. a new subclause has
    been added for testing mechanical interlocking devices;<br />\r\nr. the high-
    and low-temperature test is mandatory if the temperature limits for the service
    conditions of the apparatus (defined by the manufacturer) are above +40 °C or
    below −5 °C, and a more detailed testing procedure is given;<br />\r\ns. the testing
    procedure to verify the proper functioning of the position-indicating device allows
    a more practicable testing for every technology used;<br />\r\nt. a new Annex
    B has been added with title: \"Current-switching capability required of disconnectors
    and earthing switches\";<br />\r\nu. a new Annex C has been added with title:
    \"Tolerances on test quantities for type tests\";<br />\r\nv. a new Annex E has
    been added with title: \"Extension of validity of type tests\"."
