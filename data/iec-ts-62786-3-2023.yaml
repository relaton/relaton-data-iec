  content: "IEC TS 62786-3:2023, which is a Technical Specification, provides principles
    and technical requirements for interconnection of distributed Battery Energy Storage
    System (BESS) to the distribution network. It applies to the design, operation
    and testing of BESS interconnected to distribution networks. It includes the additional
    requirements for BESS, such as connection scheme, choice of switchgear, normal
    operating range, immunity to disturbance, active power response to frequency deviation,
    reactive power response to voltage variations and voltage changes, EMC and power
    quality, interface protection, connection and start to generate electric power,
    active power management, monitoring, control and communication, and grid-connected
    tests.<br />\r\nThe stationary BESSs considered within the scope of this document
    include electrical forms such as lead-acid, lithium-ion, liquid flow and sodium-sulfur
    batteries, interconnected to medium voltage (MV) or low voltage (LV) distribution
    networks via bidirectional DC to AC power converters. This document will specify
    active and reactive power response and grid-connected testing for distributed
    BESS, as a supplement for IEC TS 62786-1:2023.<br />\r\nThis document specifies
    interface requirements for connection of distributed BESS with the distribution
    network operating at a nominal frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz."
