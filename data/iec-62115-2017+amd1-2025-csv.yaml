  content: "IEC 62115:2017+AMD1:2025 CSV specifies safety requirements for electric
    toys that have at least one function dependant on electricity, electric toys being
    any product designed or intended, whether or not exclusively, for use in play
    by children under 14 years of age.<br />\r\nExamples of electric toys also within
    the scope of this standard are:<br />\r\n- constructional sets;<br />\r\n- experimental
    sets;<br />\r\n- functional electric toys (an electric toy that performs and is
    used in the same way as a product, appliance or installation intended for use
    by adults, and which may be a scale model of such product, appliance or installation);<br
    />\r\n- electric toy computers as well as a doll's house having an interior lamp.<br
    />\r\nIf the packaging is intended to have play value then it is considered to
    be part of the electric toy.<br />\r\nThis International Standard only covers
    the safety aspects of electric toys that relate to an electrical function.<br
    />\r\nThis standard covers the safety of electric toys taking power from any source,
    such as batteries, transformers, solar cells and inductive connections.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2003, Amendment
    1 (2004) and Amendment 2 (2010). This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the general conditions for tests has been
    rewritten and modified (Clause 5);<br />\r\n- the criteria for reduced testing
    has been modified (Clause 6);<br />\r\n- warnings for toys using button batteries
    or coin batteries have been added (7.3.3.2, 7.3.3.3);<br />\r\n- warnings on ride-on
    toys have been added (7.5);<br />\r\n- the requirements concerning accessibility
    of batteries have been updated (13.4.1 and 13.4.2);<br />\r\n- added requirements
    to cover toys placed above a child (13.4.4);<br />\r\n- added requirements to
    cover toys connected to other equipment (13.9);<br />\r\n- modified the requirements
    for safety of toys incorporating optical radiation sources (Annex E), to include
    requirements for using the technical LED data sheet for checking compliance with
    the specified accessible emission limits (AEL);<br />\r\n- updated the details
    for measurements of the optical radiation from the toy (Annex E);<br />\r\n- introduced
    an informative Annex I concerning measurement methods for toys with an integrated
    field source generating EMF;<br />\r\n- included a normative Annex J concerning
    safety of remote-controls for electric ride-on toys.<br />\r\nThe attention of
    National Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing
    organizations may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended
    or revised IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new
    requirements and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is
    the recommendation of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted
    for implementation nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months
    from the date of its publication.<br />\r\nKey words: Safety, Electric Toys<br
    />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum 1 (2019-08) and corrigendum of the amendment
    1 (2025-10) apply to the French text only."
