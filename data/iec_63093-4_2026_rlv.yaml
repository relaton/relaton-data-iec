abstract:
- content: "IEC 63093-4:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 63093-4:2026
    specifies the dimensions that are of importance for mechanical interchangeability
    for a preferred range of RM-cores and low-profile RM-cores made of ferrite, and
    the locations of their terminal pins on a 2,54 mm printed wiring grid in relation
    to the base outlines of the cores. It also gives guidance on allowable limits
    of surface irregularities applicable to RM-cores in accordance with the relevant
    generic specification. The selection of core sizes for this document is based
    on the philosophy of including those sizes which are industrial standards, either
    by inclusion in a national standard, or by broad-based use in industry. This document
    is a specification useful in the negotiations between ferrite core manufacturers
    and customers about surface irregularities. The general considerations that the
    design of this range of cores is based upon are given in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) revision of Table 3 and Table 4 according to IEC
    60205 ED4."
