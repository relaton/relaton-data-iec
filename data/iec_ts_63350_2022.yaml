abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 63350:2022 specifies generic requirements for creating a digital
    system that is used for measuring the characteristics of visually detectable performance,
    such as browning intensity and lightness.<br />\r\nIt defines the metrological
    requirements of this digital system and demonstrates the procedures for compliance.
    The digital system contains the measuring instrument, the software, and the reference
    materials necessary to realize the measurement process.<br />\r\nReferences to
    this document can be made by a customer when specifying the digital system and
    by the suppliers when specifying products offered.<br />\r\nInterested parties
    can agree to use this document as an input for satisfying measurement management
    system requirements in any activities.<br />\r\nThe principles of ISO 10012 are
    followed to ensure the capability of the systems.<br />\r\nCurrently, this document
    focuses on test methods described in IEC 60350-1 and IEC 60350-2 but further applications
    based on visually detectable performance criteria might be supplemented."
