abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-51:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-51:2023 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-51:2023 deals with the safety
    of electric stationary circulation pumps for house-hold and similar purposes intended
    for use in heating systems or in service water sys-tems, their rated voltage being
    not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances
    including direct current (DC) supplied appliances. The hydraulic and electrical
    parts of the pump can be in the same enclosure, so that the water flows through
    the motor and serves as a coolant, or they can be separated. Appliances not intended
    for normal household use, but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the
    public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by ap-pliances that are
    encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in gen-eral, it does
    not take into account:<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n-
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on-board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authori-ties, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar au-thorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- pumps for circulating liquids other than
    water;<br />\r\n- pumps, other than circulation pumps (IEC 60335-2-41);<br />\r\n-
    circulation pumps intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- circulation
    pumps intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such
    as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour, or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in
    2019. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the
    following significant technical changes with respect to the pre-vious edition:<br
    />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes
    have been converted to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) the use of separate
    connectors to ease the installation and establish the supply con-nection has been
    introduced (7.12.1, 22.102, 24.1.5, 24.1.101, 25.3);<br />\r\nd) clarifications
    related to remote operation (22.40, 22.49, 22.51).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to
    be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments
    unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not
    preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020)
    of that standard."
