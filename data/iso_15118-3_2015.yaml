abstract:
- content: ISO 15118-3:2015 specifies the requirements of the physical and data link
    layer for a high-level communication, directly between battery electric vehicles
    (BEV) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), termed as EV (electric vehicle)
    [ISO-1], based on a wired communication technology and the fixed electrical charging
    installation [Electric Vehicle Supply Equipment (EVSE)] used in addition to the
    basic signalling, as defined in [IEC-1]. It covers the overall information exchange
    between all actors involved in the electrical energy exchange. ISO 15118 (all
    parts) is applicable for manually connected conductive charging. Only "[IEC-1]
    modes 3 and 4" EVSEs, with a high-level communication module, are covered by this
    part of ISO 15118.
