  content: "IEC/IEEE 62395-2:2024 provides detailed recommendations for the system
    design, installation, maintenance and repair of electrical resistance trace heating
    systems in industrial and commercial applications. This document does not include
    or provide for any applications in potentially explosive atmospheres.<br />\r\nThis
    standard cancels and replaces IEC 62395-2:2013. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis standard includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to IEC 62395-2:2013:<br />\r\na) Design considerations for
    trace heating on sprinkler systems have been expanded and a figure has been added
    to illustrate how to avoid undue shadowing of spray patterns from insulated sprigs
    close to sprinkler heads;<br />\r\nb) Specific details of design considerations
    for trace heating for emergency eyewash units and safety showers have been added.<br
    />\r\nThis document is published as an IEC/IEEE Dual Logo standard."
