abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>The procedures specified do not
    prevent communication between transport entities conforming to ISO/IEC 8073 only
    and those conforming to ISO/IEC 8073 as well as to this standard. The use of a
    protocol identification procedure allows transport entities to be implemented
    which can support both the OSI transport protocols and non-OSI transport protocols
    above the OSI network layer.</p>
