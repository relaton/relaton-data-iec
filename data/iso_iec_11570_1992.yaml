abstract:
- content: The procedures specified do not prevent communication between transport
    entities conforming to ISO/IEC 8073 only and those conforming to ISO/IEC 8073
    as well as to this standard. The use of a protocol identification procedure allows
    transport entities to be implemented which can support both the OSI transport
    protocols and non-OSI transport protocols above the OSI network layer.
