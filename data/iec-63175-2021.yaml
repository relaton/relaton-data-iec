  content: IEC 63175:2021 is applicable to hydrogen ion H- acceleration proton cyclotrons
    with one or more fixed energies within the range of 10 MeV to less than 30 MeV
    and a beam intensity equal to or greater than 300 μA. This document specifies
    the performance and safety requirements, structure, technical requirements, test
    methods, identification, packing, transportation, storage and accompanying documents
    for such cyclotrons. This document is intended for manufacturers of high intensity
    proton cyclotron within the energy range of 10 MeV to less than 30 MeV, and responsible
    organizations where such cyclotrons are installed.
