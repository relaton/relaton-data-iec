abstract:
- content: IEC TS 60286-6-1:2023 specifies a bulk case capable of containing miniaturized
    surface mount components of sizes within the range of 0402M to 1005M (see Table
    1 for explanation of the codes). The bulk case is designed for transport and storage
    of components and to supply of components directly or by an appropriate feeder
    to the placement machine. The bulk case is equipped with a coupling interface
    to enable its automatic handling, e.g. by a robot or automatic handling machines.
