  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-20:2022 (EN) IEC TS 62607 establishes a standardized method
    to determine the chemical key control characteristic<br />\r\n- metallic impurity
    content<br />\r\nfor powders of graphene-based materials by<br />\r\n- inductively
    coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).<br />\r\nThe metallic impurity content
    is derived by the signal intensity of measured elements through MS spectrum of
    ICP-MS.<br />\r\n- The method is applicable for powder of graphene and related
    materials, including bilayer graphene (2LG), trilayer graphene (3LG), few-layer
    graphene (FLG), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and graphene oxide (GO).<br />\r\n–
    The typical application area is in the microelectronics industry, e.g. conductive
    pastes, displays, etc., for manufacturers to guide material design, and for downstream
    users to select suitable products."
