  content: "IEC 60335-2-97:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-97:2023 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-97:2016+AMD1:2019
    CSV edition 3.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-97:2023 deals with the safety of electric
    drives for shutters, blinds and awnings, intended for household and similar purposes,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase drives and 480
    V for other drives, including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of equipment that can be driven are<br />\r\n– spring
    controlled folding arm awnings;<br />\r\n– curtains;<br />\r\n– grilles covering
    doors and windows;<br />\r\n– projection screens;<br />\r\n– shutters covering
    doors and windows;<br />\r\n– draperies.<br />\r\nDrives can be supplied with
    a driven part.<br />\r\nDrives not intended for normal household use but that
    nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public, such as drives intended
    to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry, on farms and on industrial premises,
    are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by drives that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    drive safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with
    the drive.<br />\r\nFor appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board
    ships or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary. In many countries,
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour, the national water
    supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not apply
    to<br />\r\n– drives intended to be used in locations where special conditions
    prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour
    or gas);<br />\r\n– drives for vertically moving garage doors for residential
    use (IEC 60335-2-95);<br />\r\n– drives for gates, doors and windows (IEC 60335-2-103);<br
    />\r\n– drives used in premises such as hangars or in heavy industry;<br />\r\n–
    drives for theatre curtains.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces
    the third edition published in 2016 and Amendment 1: 2019. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has
    been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) scope includes DC-supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) some notes have been converted
    to normative text (Clause 1, 5.10, 20.101, 20.103);<br />\r\nd) use of artificial
    loads is introduced (5.10);<br />\r\ne) application of test probe 19 has been
    introduced (8.1.1, 20.2);<br />\r\nf) addition of surface temperatures for external
    accessible surfaces (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\ng) requirements are added for drives
    intended for permanent connection delivered with a connector to ease the installation
    (22.102, 24.1.101, 25.3);<br />\r\nh) clarification for connectors that are non-detachable
    once engaged (24.1.5).<br />\r\ni) added requirements for instructions for parts
    of class III construction supplied from a detachable power supply part (7.12,
    7.12.1).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
