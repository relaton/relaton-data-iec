  content: 'ISO/IEC 30101:2014 is for sensor networks in order to support smart grid
    technologies for power generation, distribution, networks, energy storage, load
    efficiency, control and communications, and associated environmental challenges.
    This International Standard characterizes the requirements for sensor networks
    to support the aforementioned applications and challenges. Data from sensors in
    smart grid systems is collected, transmitted, published, and acted upon to ensure
    efficient coordination of the various systems and subsystems. The intelligence
    derived through the sensor networks supports synchronization, monitoring and responding,
    command and control, data/information processing, security, information routing,
    and human-grid display/graphical interfaces. This International standard specifies:
    - interfaces between the sensor networks and other networks for smart grid system
    applications, - sensor network architecture to support smart grid systems, - interface
    between sensor networks with smart grid systems, and - sensor network based emerging
    applications and services to support smart grid systems.'
