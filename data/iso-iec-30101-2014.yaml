  content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />ISO&#x2F;IEC 30101:2014 is for sensor
    networks in order to support smart grid technologies for power generation, distribution,
    networks, energy storage, load efficiency, control and communications, and associated
    environmental challenges. This International Standard characterizes the requirements
    for sensor networks to support the aforementioned applications and challenges.
    Data from sensors in smart grid systems is collected, transmitted, published,
    and acted upon to ensure efficient coordination of the various systems and subsystems.
    The intelligence derived through the sensor networks supports synchronization,
    monitoring and responding, command and control, data&#x2F;information processing,
    security, information routing, and human-grid display&#x2F;graphical interfaces.
    This International standard specifies: - interfaces between the sensor networks
    and other networks for smart grid system applications, - sensor network architecture
    to support smart grid systems, - interface between sensor networks with smart
    grid systems, and - sensor network based emerging applications and services to
    support smart grid systems.'
