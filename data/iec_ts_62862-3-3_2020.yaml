abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62862-3-3:2020 specifies the technical requirements, tests, durability
    and technical performance parameters of solar thermal receivers for absorbing
    concentrated solar radiation and transferring the heat to a fluid used in concentrated
    solar thermal power plants with linear-focus solar collectors. The receivers addressed
    consist of an absorber tube and an insulating glass envelope tube.<br />\r\nThis
    document includes the definitions of technical properties and characterization
    of geometry and performance parameters as well as the test methods for optical
    characterization, heat loss, and durability. For the sake of clarity, it is stated
    here that the thermal loss tests described in this document do not deliver the
    thermal loss of the receiver tubes when they are installed in commercial solar
    fields."
