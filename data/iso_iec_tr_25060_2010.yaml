abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 describes a potential family of International Standards,
    named the Common Industry Formats (CIF), that document the specification and evaluation
    of the usability of interactive systems. It provides a general overview of the
    CIF framework and contents, definitions, and the relationship of the framework
    elements. The intended users of the framework are identified, as well as the situations
    in which the framework may be applied. The assumptions and constraints of the
    framework are also enumerated.<br /><br />\r\nThe framework content includes the
    following:<br />\r\n\tconsistent terminology and classification of specification,
    evaluation and reporting;<br />\r\n\ta definition of the type and scope of formats
    and the high-level structure to be used for documenting required information and
    the results of evaluation.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
    /><br /><br /><br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 is applicable to software
    and hardware products used for predefined tasks. The information items are intended
    to be used as part of system-level documentation resulting from development processes
    such as those in ISO 9241-210, and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 7 process standards.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 focuses on documenting those elements needed for design
    and development of usable systems, rather than prescribing a specific process.
    It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International Standards,
    including ISO 9241, ISO 20282, ISO/IEC 9126 and the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC 25000
    to ISO/IEC 25099).<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 does not prescribe any
    kind of method, life cycle or process."
