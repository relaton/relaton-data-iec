abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 describes a potential family of International
    Standards, named the Common Industry Formats (CIF), that document the specification
    and evaluation of the usability of interactive systems. It provides a general
    overview of the CIF framework and contents, definitions, and the relationship
    of the framework elements. The intended users of the framework are identified,
    as well as the situations in which the framework may be applied. The assumptions
    and constraints of the framework are also enumerated.</p><p>The framework content
    includes the following:</p><ul><li>consistent terminology and classification of
    specification, evaluation and reporting;</li><li>a definition of the type and
    scope of formats and the high-level structure to be used for documenting required
    information and the results of evaluation.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 is
    applicable to software and hardware products used for predefined tasks. The information
    items are intended to be used as part of system-level documentation resulting
    from development processes such as those in ISO 9241-210, and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC
    7 process standards.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 focuses on documenting those
    elements needed for design and development of usable systems, rather than prescribing
    a specific process. It is intended to be used in conjunction with existing International
    Standards, including ISO 9241, ISO 20282, ISO/IEC 9126 and the SQuaRE series (ISO/IEC
    25000 to ISO/IEC 25099).</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 25060:2010 does not prescribe any kind
    of method, life cycle or process.</p>"
