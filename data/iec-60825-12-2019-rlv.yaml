  content: "IEC 60825-12:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n \r\n<p>IEC 60825-12:2019
    provides requirements and specific guidance for the manufacture and safe use of
    laser products and systems used for point-to-point or point-to-multipoint free
    space optical data transmission in the wavelength range from 180 nm to 1 mm. This
    document only addresses the open beam portion of the system. If portions of the
    equipment or system incorporate optical fibre that extends from the confinements
    of the enclosure(s), the manufacturing and safety requirements in IEC 60825-2
    apply to those portions only. This document does not apply to systems designed
    for the purposes of transmitting optical power for applications such as material
    processing or medical treatment. This document also does not apply to the use
    of systems in explosive atmospheres (see IEC 60079-0). Light-emitting diodes (LEDs)
    employed by free space optical communication systems (FSOCSs), used for the purpose
    of free space optical data transmission, do not fall into the scope of this document.
    This document covers lasers employed by FSOCSs used for the purpose of free space
    optical data transmission. This document:<br />\r\n• provides information to protect
    people from potentially hazardous optical radiation produced by FSOCSs by specifying
    engineering controls and requirements, administrative controls and work practices
    according to the degree of the hazard; and<br />\r\n• specifies requirements for
    manufacturing, installation, service and operating organizations in order to establish
    procedures and provide written information so that proper precautions can be adopted.<br
    />\r\nBecause of the nature of FSOCSs, also known as optical wireless or free-air
    information transmission systems, care is taken in their manufacture as well as
    their installation, operation, maintenance and service to assure the safe deployment
    and use of these systems. This document places the responsibility for certain
    product safety requirements, as well as requirements for providing appropriate
    information on how to use these systems safely, on the manufacturer of the system
    and/or transmitters. It places the responsibility for the safe deployment and
    use of these systems on the installer and/or operating organization. It places
    the responsibility for adherence to safety instructions during installation and
    service operations on the installation and service organizations as appropriate,
    and during operation and maintenance functions on the operating organization.
    It is recognized that the user of this document may fall into one or more of the
    categories of manufacturer, installer, service organization and/or operating organization
    as mentioned above. This document does not apply to a laser product if classification
    by the manufacturer according to IEC 60825-1 shows that the emission level does
    not exceed the accessible emission limit (AEL) of Class 1 under all conditions
    of operation, maintenance, service and reasonably foreseeable failure.<br />\r\nKey
