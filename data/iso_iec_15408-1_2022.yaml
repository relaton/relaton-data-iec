    PP-Configurations, packages, Security Targets (ST), and conformance types;<br
    />\r\n- a description of the organization of security components throughout the
    model;<br />\r\n- the various operations by which the functional and assurance
    components given in ISO/IEC 15408‑2 and ISO/IEC 15408‑3 can be tailored through
