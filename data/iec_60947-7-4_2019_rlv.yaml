abstract:
- content: "IEC 60947-7-4:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><p>IEC 60947-7-4:2019 specifies
    requirements for PCB terminal blocks primarily intended for industrial or similar
    use. Mounting and fixing on the printed circuit board is made by soldering, press-in
    or equivalent methods to provide electrical and mechanical connection between
    copper conductors and the printed circuit board. This document applies to PCB
    terminal blocks intended to connect copper conductors, with or without special
    preparation, having a cross-section between 0,08 mm2 and 300 mm2 (AWG 28-600 kcmil),
    intended to be used in circuits of a rated voltage not exceeding 1 000 V AC up
    to 1 000 Hz or 1 500 V DC. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) additional test for PCB terminal blocks with clamping
    units, where contact pressure is transmitted through insulating materials;<br
    />\r\nb) tightening torques for screws now given in Table 4 of this document (previously
    given in Table 4 of IEC 60947-1:2007); tightening torques added for an additional
    type of screw;<br />\r\nc) new criteria for verification of contact resistance
    introduced;<br />\r\nd) clarification in the description of the temperature-rise
    test (current-temperature derating); corrections in the test sequence according
    to Figure 4.</p>"
