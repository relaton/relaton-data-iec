abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 19797:2004 measures output and by the linearization method (LM).There
    is a table of output values and a graph for the first and linearized output. This
    method produces a linear relationship between the linear digital input data and
    the output data on a visual relative CIELAB scale for the colour primaries. The
    visual uniformity of overprint scales can be improved by this method. The method
    is applicable for systems that do not have colour management or as a linearization
    method for devices that could be used as a setup_state for colour management.
