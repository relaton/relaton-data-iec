abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-51:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-51:2019
    deals with the safety of electric stationary circulation pumps for household and
    similar purposes intended for use in heating systems or in service water systems,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and
    480 V for other appliances. The hydraulic and electrical parts of the pump can
    be in the same enclosure, so that the water flows through the motor and serves
    as a coolant, or they can be separated. Appliances not intended for normal household
    use, but that nevertheless may be a source of danger to the public, such as appliances
    intended to be used by laymen in shops, in light industry and on farms, are within
    the scope of this standard. As far as is practicable, this standard deals with
    the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by all persons
    in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into account<br
    />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental capabilities;
    or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the appliance safely
    without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n– children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n– for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    apply to:<br />\r\n– pumps for circulating liquids other than water;<br />\r\n–
    pumps, other than circulation pumps (IEC 60335-2-41);<br />\r\n– circulation pumps
    intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– circulation pumps intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour, or gas).<br />\r\nThis fourth
    edition cancels and replaces the third edition published in 2002, Amendment 1:2008
    and Amendment 2:2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n– some instructions are no longer required (7.12);<br
    />\r\n– converted some notes to normative text (7.12.1, 11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\n–
    new instructions for installation of thermal insulation (7.12.1);<br />\r\n– the
    leakage current value is modified (Clause A.2).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be
    used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments.
    It was established on the basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard."
