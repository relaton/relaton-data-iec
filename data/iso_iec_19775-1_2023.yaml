abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 19775 Extensible 3D (X3D) defines a software system that integrates
    network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application
    is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically
    modified through a variety of mechanisms. This document defines the architecture
    and base components of X3D.</p><p>The semantics of X3D describe an abstract functional
    behaviour of time-based, interactive 3D, multimedia information. This document
    does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts
    (<em>e.g.</em>, screen resolution and input devices). This document is intended
    for a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in
    interpretation and implementation of the functionality. For example, this document
    does not assume the existence of a mouse or 2D display device.</p><p>Each X3D
    application:</p><ol start="1" type="a"><li>implicitly establishes a world coordinate
    space for all objects defined, as well as all objects included by the application,</li><li>explicitly
    defines and composes a set of 3D and multimedia objects,</li><li>can specify hyperlinks
    to other files and applications,</li><li>can define programmatic or data-driven
    object behaviours,</li><li>can connect to external modules or applications via
    programming and scripting languages,</li><li>explicitly declares its functional
    requirements by specifying a profile, and</li><li>can declare additional functional
    requirements by specifying components.</li></ol>
