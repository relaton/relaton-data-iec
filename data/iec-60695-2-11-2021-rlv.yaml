  content: "IEC 60695-2-11:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60695-2-11:2021
    specifies a test method on an end product. It is intended to simulate the effects
    of thermal stresses produced by an electrically heated source to represent a fire
    hazard. This test method is used to check that, under defined test conditions,
    an end product exposed to an electrically heated source has either a limited ability
    to ignite or, if it ignites, a limited ability to propagate flame. However, the
    fire hazard analysis, the flammability aspects and the flame spreading to other
    products are not covered by this document. This basic safety publication focusing
    on safety test method(s) is primarily intended for use by technical committees
    in the preparation of safety publications in accordance with the principles laid
    down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51. One of the responsibilities of a technical
    committee is, wherever applicable, to make use of basic safety publications in
    the preparation of its publications. This publication is to be read in conjunction
    with IEC 60695-2-10. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition
    published in 2014. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) Numerous terms and definitions relevant to this document
    have been added to Clause 3."
