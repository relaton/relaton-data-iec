  content: "IEC 60974-4:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60974-4:2025
    specifies test procedures for periodic inspection and, after repair, to ensure
    electrical safety. These test procedures are also applicable for maintenance.
    This document is applicable to power sources for arc welding and allied processes
    designed in accordance with IEC 60974-1 or IEC 60974-6. Stand-alone ancillary
    equipment designed in accordance with other parts of IEC 60974 can be tested in
    accordance with relevant requirements of this part of IEC 60974. This document
    includes requirements for battery-powered arc welding power sources, which are
    given in Annex D.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The welding power source can be tested with
    any ancillary equipment fitted that can affect the test results.<br />\r\nThis
    document is not applicable to testing of new power sources or engine-driven power
    sources.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 For a power source not built in accordance with IEC 60974-1,
    see Annex C.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- examples for the measurements in respect of EN 50699,<br />\r\n-
    consideration of measuring equipment in respect of IEC 61557 series,<br />\r\n-
    more determinations of no-load voltage for welding equipment built according to
    IEC 60974-1:1998 and IEC 60974-1:1998/AMD1:2000 or earlier,<br />\r\n- new Annex
    D providing additional information to be considered when testing battery-powered
    welding power sources and connected chargers."
