abstract:
- content: "This document specifies the data migration method for DVD-R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM,
    +R, +RW, CD-R, CD-RW, BD Recordable and BD Rewritable disks for long-term data
    storage. By applying this document for information storage, digital data can be
    migrated to a next new disk without loss from the present disk if data errors
    are completely corrected before and during the migration and provided copying
    of the data is allowed.<br />\r\nThis document specifies:<br />\r\n- a data migration
    method for long-term data storage;<br />\r\n- test methods for measuring maximum
    data error, including ambient condition, test area, test drive, disk preparation
    and test execution;<br />\r\n- an initial performance test and a periodic performance
    test that check an error rate of data recorded on the disks with categorized maximum
    data error tables;<br />\r\n- precautions to reduce the possibility of deterioration
    in order to assure the integrity of the disks during their use, storage, handling
    or transportation; and<br />\r\n- the estimated lifetime of B<sub>mig</sub> (B<sub>0,000
    1</sub>) life to determine the test interval for the periodic performance test."
