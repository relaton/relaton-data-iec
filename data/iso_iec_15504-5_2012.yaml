abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 provides an example of a Process Assessment Model
    for use in performing a conformant assessment in accordance with the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 15504-2.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 provides a detailed description
    of the structure and key components of the Process Assessment Model, which includes
    two dimensions: a process dimension and a capability dimension. It also introduces
    assessment indicators.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 uses process definitions from
    ISO/IEC 12207:2008 to identify a Process Reference Model. The processes of the
    Process Reference Model are described in the Process Assessment Model in terms
    of purpose and outcomes and are grouped in three process categories. The Process
    Assessment Model expands the Process Reference Model process definitions by including
    a set of process performance indicators called base practices for each process.
    The Process Assessment Model also defines a second set of indicators of process
    performance by associating work products with each process.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012
    duplicates the definitions of the capability levels and process attributes from
    ISO/IEC 15504-2, and expands each of the nine attributes through the inclusion
    of a set of generic practices. These generic practices belong to a set of indicators
    of process capability, in association with generic resource indicators, and generic
    work product indicators.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 also provides the following:</p><ul><li>a
    statement of conformance of the Process Assessment Model to the requirements defined
    in ISO/IEC 15504-2;</li><li>selected characteristics for typical work products
    to assist the assessor in evaluating the capability level of processes;</li><li>style
    guides for defining base practices, work products and generic practices for adjusting
    the Process Assessment Model, and guidance explaining how to expand or adapt the
    model;</li><li>some processes supplementary to the Process Assessment Model.</li></ul>"
