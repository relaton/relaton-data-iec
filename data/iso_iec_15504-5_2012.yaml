abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 provides an example of a Process Assessment Model
    for use in performing a conformant assessment in accordance with the requirements
    of ISO/IEC 15504-2.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 provides a detailed description
    of the structure and key components of the Process Assessment Model, which includes
    two dimensions: a process dimension and a capability dimension. It also introduces
    assessment indicators.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 uses process definitions
    from ISO/IEC 12207:2008 to identify a Process Reference Model. The processes of
    the Process Reference Model are described in the Process Assessment Model in terms
    of purpose and outcomes and are grouped in three process categories. The Process
    Assessment Model expands the Process Reference Model process definitions by including
    a set of process performance indicators called base practices for each process.
    The Process Assessment Model also defines a second set of indicators of process
    performance by associating work products with each process.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15504-5:2012 duplicates the definitions of the capability levels and process attributes
    from ISO/IEC 15504-2, and expands each of the nine attributes through the inclusion
    of a set of generic practices. These generic practices belong to a set of indicators
    of process capability, in association with generic resource indicators, and generic
    work product indicators.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15504-5:2012 also provides the
    following:<br />\r\n\t a statement of conformance of the Process Assessment Model
    to the requirements defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2;<br />\r\n\t selected characteristics
    for typical work products to assist the assessor in evaluating the capability
    level of processes;<br />\r\n\t style guides for defining base practices, work
    products and generic practices for adjusting the Process Assessment Model, and
    guidance explaining how to expand or adapt the model;<br />\r\n\t some processes
    supplementary to the Process Assessment Model.<br /><br /><br />"
