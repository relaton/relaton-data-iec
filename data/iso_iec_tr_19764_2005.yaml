abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 19764:2005 defines a methodology and a guided check-list for
    evaluation of cultural adaptability in software, hardware and other IT products.
    The check-list and guidelines are not only applicable to all IT products, but
    also can be expanded to meet the requirements of specific cultural environments.ISO/IEC
    TR 19764:2005 will assist the marketplace by providing an objective evaluation
    method to measure cultural and linguistic adaptability. Although local or national
    requirements of a legal and regulatory nature may not always be directly relevant
    in evaluation of products meeting cultural and linguistic adaptability, they sometimes
    constitute a world-wide challenge for many products or services, now including
    those which are IT-based. ISO/IEC TR 19764:2005 provides indications reminding
    that such requirements may have to be met in a national or local profile to complete
    cultural and linguistic requirements in some countries and hence should be considered
    in evaluation, as guidance to producers.
