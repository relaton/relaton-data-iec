  content: "IEC 60794-1-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60794-1-1:2015(E)
    applies to optical fibre cables for use with communication equipment and devices
    employing similar techniques and to cables having a combination of both optical
    fibres and electrical conductors. The object of this standard is to establish
    uniform generic requirements for the geometrical, transmission, material, mechanical,
    ageing (environmental exposure), climatic and electrical properties of optical
    fibre cables and cable elements, where appropriate. This fourth edition cancels
    and replaces the third edition, published in 2011. This edition constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- the expansion of the
    definitions, graphical symbols, terminology and abbreviations content, with the
    aim of making this standard the default and reference for all others in the IEC
    60794-x series;<br />\r\n- the inclusion of updated and expanded optical fibre,
    attenuation and bandwidth sections, with the aim of making this standard the default
    and reference for all others in the IEC 60794-x series.<br />\r\nKeywords: optical
    fibre cables, cable elements"
