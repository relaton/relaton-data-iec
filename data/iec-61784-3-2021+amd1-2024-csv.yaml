  content: IEC 61784-3:2021+AMD1:2024 CSV explains some common principles that can
    be used in the transmission of safety-relevant messages among participants within
    a distributed network which use fieldbus technology in accordance with the requirements
    of IEC 61508 (all parts) for functional safety. These principles are based on
    the black channel approach. They can be used in various industrial applications
    such as process control, manufacturing automation and machinery.
