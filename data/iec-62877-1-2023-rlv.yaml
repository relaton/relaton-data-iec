    applies to electrolytes and their components used for filling vented lead acid
    batteries with dry-charged cells and for electrolyte replenishment, replacement
    or electrolyte density adjustment of batteries in operation. This document defines
    the composition, purity and properties of electrolyte, for application where specific
    instructions from the battery manufacturer are not available. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2016. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
