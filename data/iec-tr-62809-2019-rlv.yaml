  content: "IEC TR 62809:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 62809:2019
    provides an overview of the requirements and tests of IEC 60601-2-66 in combination
    with the applicable sections of IEC 60601-1, and the collateral standards of the
    IEC 60601 series. It is intended to assist various groups involved in the product
    lifecycles process - like designers and suppliers - to get an overview of the
    basic requirements without studying all involved standard documents in detail.
    The table includes not all but just the more common requirements and tests. It
    is crucial to understand that the summary in this document cannot serve as an
    input for a product requirement specification or as a test plan without consulting
    IEC 60601-2-66 itself. This document alone cannot be used to establish or assess
    compliance to IEC 60601-2-66."
