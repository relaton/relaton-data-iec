  content: IEC TR 61000-4-38:2015(E) defines a test protocol for flicker test systems
    designed to perform compliance tests in accordance with IEC 61000-3-3 and IEC
    61000-3-11. It is intended to provide test system manufacturers and testing laboratories
    with systematic methods to determine if the flicker test system meets the IEC
    design specifications for a wide range of voltage fluctuations and fluctuation
    frequencies, as specified in IEC 61000-4-15:2010, Table 5, that have been observed
    in product testing. It has the status of a basic EMC publication in accordance
    with IEC Guide 107.
