abstract:
- content: IEC TR 62921:2016(E) provides specific guidance for the use of streamlining
    techniques that minimize cost and resources needed to complete greenhouse gas
    emissions quantifications. In addition, the product category rules (PCR) section
    of this Technical Report recommends "state-of-the-art" process and data assumptions
    in order to reduce uncertainty. Lastly, this Technical Report provides an example
    of how a calculation could be performed.
