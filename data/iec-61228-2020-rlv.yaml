  content: "IEC 61228:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.\r\n<p>IEC 61228:2020 describes
    the method of measuring, evaluating and specifying the UV irradiation characteristics
    of fluorescent ultraviolet lamps that are used in appliances for tanning purposes.
    It includes specific requirements regarding the marking of such lamps. This third
    edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2008. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- maintenance
    code: description of the depreciation of the UV irradiance lamp during operation;<br
    />\r\n- operating position: information added for single capped lamps;<br />\r\n-
    spectroradiometric measuring system: new information about distance between sensor
    and lamp axis;<br />\r\n- measurement and evaluation procedure: separated detailed
    information for double capped fluorescent UV lamps and single capped fluorescent
    UV lamps;<br />\r\n- Annex C (normative), Method of test for irradiance maintenance:
    new information added;<br />\r\n- Annex D (normative), Reflector gauge: new information
    added;<br />\r\n- Annex E (normative), Lamp datasheets for measurement: complementary
    information added.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol style=\"list-style-type:lower-alpha\">\r\n</ol>"
