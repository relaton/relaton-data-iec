  content: "IEC TR 62000:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC TR 62000:2021
    provides guidelines concerning single-mode fibre inter-compatibility. A given
    category of single-mode fibre, for example B-655, can have different implementations
    by suitably optimising several of the following parameters: mode field diameter
    (hence effective area), chromatic dispersion coefficient, slope of the chromatic
    dispersion curve, cable cut-off wavelength. These guidelines indicate the items
    that are taken into account when planning to connect<br />\r\n- different implementations
    of single-mode fibres of the same category, for example different implementations
    of Class B single-mode fibres, and<br />\r\n- single-mode fibres of different
    sub-categories, for example B-652.B with B-655.C.<br />\r\nThis third edition
    cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2010. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- global uniformity of
    terminology concerning fibre classes, categories and sub-categories throughout
    the document;<br />\r\n- updating and aligning to the new naming convention of
    IEC 60793-2-50 for class B fibre categories and sub-categories;<br />\r\n- updating
    and aligning with IEC 60793-2-50 as per supported fibre sub-categories;<br />\r\n-
    additional guidelines concerning combination of fibre parameters: chromatic dispersion
    and slope, polarization mode dispersion;<br />\r\n- additional guidelines concerning
    non-linear affects;<br />\r\n- updating of bibliographical references."
