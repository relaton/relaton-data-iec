    <p>ISO/IEC 19763 specifies a metamodel framework for interoperability. ISO/IEC 19763-3:2007 specifies the metamodel that is intended to promote interoperation among application systems based on ontologies.</p>
    <p>The metamodel specified by ISO/IEC 19763-3:2007 provides a facility to register administrative information related to ontologies, which consist of several sentences that use several non-logical symbols, irrespective of the languages in which they are described. The metamodel also distinguishes a reference ontology, an ontology that is usable and sharable by a community of interest, and a local ontology, an ontology that is specialized for defined applications.</p>
    <p>The metamodel, together with repositories that contain actual ontologies, makes it possible for users to gain the benefits of interoperation among application systems based on ontologies.</p>
