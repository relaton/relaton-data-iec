    <p>ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 defines the exchange of human vascular biometric image information. It defines a specific definition of attributes, a data record format for storing and transmitting vascular biometric images and certain attributes, a sample record and conformance criteria.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 is intended for applications requiring the exchange of raw or processed vascular biometric images. It is intended for applications not limited by the amount of storage required. It is a compromise or a trade-off between the resources required for data storage or transmission and the potential for improved data quality/accuracy. Basically, it is to enable various algorithms to identify or verify the vascular biometric image data transferred from other image sources. Currently available vascular biometric technologies that may utilize ISO/IEC 19794-9:2007 for image exchange are technologies that use the back of the hand, palm and finger.</p>
