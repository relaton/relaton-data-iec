  content: 'IEC TR 62343-6-5:2014 which is a technical report, describes an investigation
    into operating mechanical shock and vibration for dynamic modules. It also presents
    the results of a survey on the evaluation and mechanical simulation of mechanical
    shock and vibration testing. Also included is a study of standardization for operating
    mechanical shock and vibration test methods. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2011. It constitutes technical revision. The main
    change with respect to the previous edition is the addition of "Results of a questionnaire
    on dynamic module operating shock and vibration test conditions" in Annex A. Keywords:
    mechanical shock and vibration for dynamic modules, vibration testing'
