  content: IEC TR 62899-303-2:2024, which is a Technical Report, lays down the framework
    for defining standard mechanical dimensions of equipment utilized in the field
    of printed electronics. While primarily focused on substrate-based printing equipment,
    the guidelines and standards established in this document also maintain flexibility
    for application to transient printing equipment. Through this inclusivity, the
    document seeks to cover a broad spectrum of the industry, ensuring uniformity
    and adaptability across various printing technologies in the printed electronics
    domain.
