abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-60:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-60:2017
    deals with the safety of electric whirlpool baths for indoor use and whirlpool
    spas, for household and similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than
    250 V for single-phase appliances and 480 V for other appliances. This standard
    also applies to appliances for circulating air or water in conventional baths.
    Appliances not intended for normal household use but that nevertheless may be
    a source of danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen
    in hotels, fitness centres and similar places, are within the scope of this standard.
    As far as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented
    by appliances that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However,
    in general, it does not take into account persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction; children playing
    with the appliance. Attention is drawn to the fact that for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    may be necessary; This standard does not apply to equipment for water circulation
    in swimming and motion exercise pools; cleaning appliances for swimming pools;
    appliances intended for medical purposes or appliances intended to be used in
    locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive
    or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas). This fourth edition cancels and
    replaces the third edition published in 2002 including its Amendment 1 (2004)
    and its Amendment 2 (2008). This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition: requirements for transportable whirlpool spas have been added
    (3.103, 5.101, 6.1, 7.12.1, 22.106, 25.1, 25.5, 25.7); some notes have been deleted
    or converted to normative text (22.101, 22.102, 22.103, 22.105); the text has
    been aligned with Ed 5.2 of Part 1. This part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments. It was established on the
    basis of the fifth edition (2010) of that standard. The attention of National
    Committees is drawn to the fact that equipment manufacturers and testing organizations
    may need a transitional period following publication of a new, amended or revised
    IEC publication in which to make products in accordance with the new requirements
    and to equip themselves for conducting new or revised tests. It is the recommendation
    of the committee that the content of this publication be adopted for implementation
    nationally not earlier than 12 months or later than 36 months from the date of
    its publication.<br /><br />\r\nKey words: Whirlpool Bath, Whirlpool Spa, Safety"
