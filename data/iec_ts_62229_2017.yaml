abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62229:2017(E) describes a conceptual model for multimedia e-publishing
    and e-book. The conceptual model is specified from the standardization point of
    view in order to clarify the functionality of e-publishing/e-book components and
    the relationships between them and to define e-publishing services. The model
    provides the key technology to be standardized in the e-publishing environment.
    The modelling is not intended for actual implementation of a system or system
    components for e-publishing. The modelling is expected to be used as a reference
    for discussing and developing new standardization work on multimedia e-publishing
    and e-books and, therefore, to contribute to the expansion of the international
    and domestic markets for multimedia e-publishing and e-book.
