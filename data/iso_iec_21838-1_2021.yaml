abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    21838-1:2021 This document specifies required characteristics of a domain-neutral
    top-level ontology (TLO) that can be used in tandem with domain ontologies at
    lower levels to support data exchange, retrieval, discovery, integration and analysis.<br
    />\r\nIf an ontology is to provide the overarching ontology content that will
    promote interoperability of domain ontologies and thereby support the design and
    use of purpose-built ontology suites, then it needs to satisfy certain requirements.
    This document specifies these requirements. It also supports a variety of other
    goals related to the achievement of semantic interoperability, for example, as
    concerns legacy ontologies developed using heterogeneous upper-level categories,
    where a coherently designed TLO can provide a target for coordinated re-engineering.<br
    />\r\nThis document specifies the characteristics an ontology needs to possess
    to support the goals of exchange, retrieval, discovery, integration and analysis
    of data by computer systems.<br />\r\nThe following are within the scope of this
    document<br />\r\n- Specification of the requirements an ontology needs to satisfy
    if it is to serve as a top-level hub ontology.<br />\r\n- Specification of the
    relations between a top-level ontology and domain ontologies.<br />\r\n- Specification
    of the role played by the terms in a top-level ontology in the formulation of
    definitions and axioms in ontologies at lower levels.<br />\r\nThe following are
    outside the scope of this document:<br />\r\n- Specification of ontology languages,
    including the languages OWL 2 and CL, used in ontology development with standard
    model-theoretic semantics.<br />\r\n- Specification of methods for reasoning with
    ontologies.<br />\r\n- Specification of translators between notations of ontologies
    developed in different ontology languages.<br />\r\n- Specification of rules governing
    the use of IRIs as permanent identifiers for ontology terms.<br />\r\n- Specification
    of the principles of ontology maintenance and versioning.<br />\r\n- Specification
    of how ontologies can be used in the tagging or annotation of data."
