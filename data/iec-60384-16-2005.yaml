    applies to fixed capacitors with metallized electrodes and polypropylene dielectric for use in electronic equipment.
    These capacitors may have "self-healing properties" depending on conditions of use. They are mainly intended for use with direct voltage. Capacitors for alternating voltage and pulse applications are not included, but are covered by IEC 60384-17.
