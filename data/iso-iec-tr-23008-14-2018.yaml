  content: "<p>This document provides guidance on the processing of high dynamic range
    (HDR) and wide colour gamut (WCG) video content. The purpose of this document
    is to provide a set of publicly referenceable recommended guidelines for the operation
    of AVC or HEVC video coding systems adapted for compressing HDR/WCG video for
    consumer distribution applications. This document includes a description of processing
    steps for converting from 4:4:4 RGB linear light representation video signals
    into non-constant luminance (NCL) Y′CbCr video signals that use the perceptual
    quantizer (PQ) transfer function defined in SMPTE ST 2084 and Rec. ITU-R BT.2100.
    Although the focus of this document is primarily on 4:2:0 Y′CbCr 10 bit representations,
    these guidelines are also applicable to other representations with higher bit
    depth or other colour formats, such as 4:4:4 Y′CbCr 12 bit video. In addition,
    this document provides some high-level recommendations for compressing these signals
    using either the AVC or HEVC video coding standards. A description of post-decoding
    processing steps is also included for converting these NCL Y′CbCr signals back
    to a linear light, 4:4:4 RGB representation.</p>"
