abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-74:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-74:2021
    deals with the safety of portable electric immersion heaters for household and
    similar purposes, their rated voltage being not more than 250 V.<br />\r\nAppliances
    not intended for normal household use but which nevertheless can be a source of
    danger to the public, such as appliances intended to be used by laymen in shops,
    in light industry and on farms, are within the scope of this standard. As far
    as is practicable, this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances
    that are encountered by all persons in and around the home. However, in general,
    it does not take into account<br />\r\n– persons (including children) whose physical,
    sensory or mental capabilities or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them
    from using the appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n–
    children playing with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br
    />\r\n– for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft,
    additional requirements may be necessary;<br />\r\n– in many countries, additional
    requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities
    responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to<br />\r\n– appliances intended exclusively for industrial
    purposes;<br />\r\n– appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n– heating elements incorporated in portable appliances,
    such as appliances for heating liquids (IEC 60335 2 15);<br />\r\n– aquarium heaters
    (IEC 60335-2-55);<br />\r\n– fixed immersion heaters (IEC 60335-2-73)<br />\r\n–
    battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces
    the second edition published in 2002, Amendment 1: 2006 and Amendment 2:2009.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) some notes have been
    converted to normative text (Clause 1, 7.1);<br />\r\nc) requirements for appliances
    that maintain a liquid at a set temperature are added (19.1, 30.2).<br />\r\nThis
    Part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and
    its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition
    that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth
    edition (2020) of that standard."
