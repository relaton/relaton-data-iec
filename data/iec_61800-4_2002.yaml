abstract:
- content: Applies to adjustable speed a.c. drive systems that include power conversion,
    control equipment and a motor. Excluded are traction for railway applications
    and electrical vehicle drives. Applies to power drive systems with converter voltages
    (line-to-line voltage), between 1 kV a.c. and 35 kV a.c., input side 50 Hz or
    60 Hz, and load side frequencies up to 600 Hz. Requirements for voltages above
    15 kV are not included and are defined by agreement between the manufacturer and
    the system supplier. For power drive systems, with voltages above 1 kV, using
    a step-down input transformer and/or a step-up output transformer in connection
    with a low voltage converter (below 1 000 V), IEC 61800-2 applies. Gives the characteristics
    of the converters, their topologies and their relationship with the complete a.c.
    drive system. It also states their performance requirements with respect to ratings,
    normal operating conditions, overload conditions, surge withstand capabilities,
    stability, protection, a.c. line earthing, topologies and testing. Furthermore,
    it deals with application guidelines, such as control strategies, torsion analysis,
    recommendations for earthing and drive system component integration.
