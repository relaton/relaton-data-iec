abstract:
- content: Specifies the physical and magnetic characteristics. Also specifies the
    quality of the recorded signals, the recorded format and the recording method,
    thereby allowing full data interchange by means of such magnetic tape cartridges.
    Is based on ISO/IEC 11319 with extensions and modifications which specify the
    additional features of the dual azimuth format, but is not intended to replace
    ISO/IEC 11319.
