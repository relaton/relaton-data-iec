abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594 has been produced to facilitate the interconnection of
    information processing systems to provide directory services. A set of such systems,
    together with the directory information that they hold, can be viewed as an integrated
    whole, called the Directory. The information held by the Directory, collectively
    known as the Directory Information Base (DIB), is typically used to facilitate
    communication between, with or about objects such as application entities, people,
    terminals and distribution lists.</p><p>ISO/IEC 9594-6:2014 defines a number of
    attribute types and matching rules which may be found useful across a range of
    applications of the Directory. One particular use for many of the attributes defined
    is in the formation of names, particularly for the classes of objects defined
    in ISO/IEC 9594-7. Other attributes types, called notification attributes, provide
    diagnostic information. ISO/IEC 9594-6:2014 defines context types which supply
    characteristics associated with attribute values. It also includes definitions
    for lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) syntaxes relevant for attribute
    types and matching rules.</p>"
