abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 19941:2017 specifies cloud computing interoperability and portability
    types, the relationship and interactions between these two cross-cutting aspects
    of cloud computing and common terminology and concepts used to discuss interoperability
    and portability, particularly relating to cloud services.</p><p>ISO/IEC 19941:2017
    is related to other standards, namely, ISO/IEC 17788, ISO/IEC 17789, ISO/IEC 19086â€‘1,
    ISO/IEC 19944, and in particular, references the cross-cutting aspects and components
    identified in ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17789 respectively.</p><p>The goal of
    this document is to ensure that all parties involved in cloud computing, particularly
    CSCs, CSPs and cloud service partners (CSNs) acting as cloud service developers,
    have a common understanding of interoperability and portability for their specific
    needs. This common understanding helps to achieve interoperability and portability
    in cloud computing by establishing common terminology and concepts.</p>"
