abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19941:2017 specifies cloud computing interoperability and portability types, the
    relationship and interactions between these two cross-cutting aspects of cloud
    computing and common terminology and concepts used to discuss interoperability
    and portability, particularly relating to cloud services.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 19941:2017
    is related to other standards, namely, ISO/IEC 17788, ISO/IEC 17789, ISO/IEC 19086â€‘1,
    ISO/IEC 19944, and in particular, references the cross-cutting aspects and components
    identified in ISO/IEC 17788 and ISO/IEC 17789 respectively.<br />\r\nThe goal
    of this document is to ensure that all parties involved in cloud computing, particularly
    CSCs, CSPs and cloud service partners (CSNs) acting as cloud service developers,
    have a common understanding of interoperability and portability for their specific
    needs. This common understanding helps to achieve interoperability and portability
    in cloud computing by establishing common terminology and concepts."
