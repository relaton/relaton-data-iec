abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 20009-4:2017 specifies anonymous entity authentication mechanisms
    based on weak secrets. The precise operation of each mechanism is specified, together
    with details of all inputs and outputs. This document is applicable to situations
    in which the server only verifies that the user belongs to a certain user group
    without obtaining any information that can be used to identify the user later
    on.
