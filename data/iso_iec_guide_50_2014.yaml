abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC Guide 50:2014 provides guidance to experts who develop and revise
    standards, specifications and similar publications. It aims to address potential
    sources of bodily harm to children from products that they use, or with which
    they are likely to come into contact, even if not specifically intended for children.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 50:2014 does not provide guidance on the prevention of intentional
    harm (e.g. child abuse) or non-physical forms of harm, such as psychological harm
    (e.g. intimidation).<br />\r\nISO/IEC Guide 50:2014 does not address the economic
    consequences of the above."
