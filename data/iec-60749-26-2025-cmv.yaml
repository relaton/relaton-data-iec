  content: "IEC 60749-26:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60749-26:2025 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60749-26:2018
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 47 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.to
    clarify any part of the content.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60749-26:2025 establishes
    the procedure for testing, evaluating, and classifying components and microcircuits
    in accordance with their susceptibility (sensitivity) to damage or degradation
    by exposure to a defined human body model (HBM) electrostatic discharge (ESD).
    The purpose of this document is to establish a test method that will replicate
    HBM failures and provide reliable, repeatable HBM ESD test results from tester
    to tester, regardless of component type. Repeatable data will allow accurate classifications
    and comparisons of HBM ESD sensitivity levels. ESD testing of semiconductor devices
    is selected from this test method, the machine model (MM) test method (see IEC
    60749‑27) or other ESD test methods in the IEC 60749 series. Unless otherwise
    specified, this test method is the one selected.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) new definitions have been added;<br />\r\nb) text has been added to clarify
    the designation of and allowances resulting from “low parasitics”. The new designation
    includes the maximum number of pins of a device that can pass the test procedure."
