  content: "IEC TR 61282-14:2019 which is a Technical Report, establishes the detailed
    analysis and calculation of the uncertainties related to the measurement of the
    attenuation of both multimode and single mode optical fibre cabling using optical
    light sources and power meters. This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2016. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- in the title: replacement of \"guide\" by \"guidelines\";<br
    />\r\n- text adaptation to allow both standard grade B and reference grade connectors
    for termination of test cords;<br />\r\n- addition of values needed for calculation
    of uncertainties, when standard grade connectors are used, to Annex D;<br />\r\n-
    correction of minor inconsistencies in Equation (18) and after.<br />\r\nKeywords:
    measurement uncertainty of the attenuation of fibre optic cabling"
