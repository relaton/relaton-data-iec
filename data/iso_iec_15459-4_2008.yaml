abstract:
- content: 'Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as configuration, maintenance history, address, order number, contents of
    the item, weight, sender, batch or lot number, etc. The information is often held
    on computer systems, and may be exchanged between parties involved via EDI (Electronic
    Data Interchange) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) messages.There are considerable
    benefits if the identity of the item is represented in bar code format, or other
    AIDC (Automatic Identification and Data Capture) media and attached to or made
    a constituent part of that which is being uniquely identified so thatit can be
    read electronically, thus minimising errors;one identity can be used by all parties;each
    party can use the identity to look up its computer files to find the data associated
    with the item;the identifier is unique within the class and cannot appear on any
    other item of the class during the lifetime of the item.The unique identifier
    for individual items defined in ISO/IEC 15459-4:2008 and represented in a bar
    code label, two-dimensional symbol, radio-frequency identification tag, or other
    AIDC media attached to the item meets these needs. All AIDC technologies have
    the potential to encode a unique identifier. It is expected that application standards
    for items, using various automatic identification technologies, will be developed
    based upon the unique identifier as a prime key. These application standards may
    be made available from the Issuing Agency.ISO/IEC 15459-4:2008 specifies a unique,
    non-significant string of characters for the unique identifier for individual
    items. The character string is intended to be represented in a bar code label
    or other AIDC media attached to the item to meet supply chain needs. To address
    management needs, different classes of items are recognized in the various parts
    of ISO/IEC 15459, which allows different requirements to be met by the unique
    identifiers associated with each class. The rules are defined for the individual
    items to identify the unique occurrence of an item, understood to mean the layers
    zero and one as will be defined in two future International Standards (ISO 17367
    and ISO 17366, respectively).'
