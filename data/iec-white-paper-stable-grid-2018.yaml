  content: "Increasingly, electricity is generated outside of big power plants, for
    example through solar panels, small wind turbines or small hydro, and usually
    close to where it is consumed. When more energy is generated than consumed, surplus
    energy is fed back into the existing power network where it can negatively affect
    grid stability. Unlike with traditional power generation, these additional resources
    are often invisible to grid operators, who are unable to predict and control when
    energy is fed back into the network.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe publication explores
    the driving factors behind decentralized power generation. It explores future
    grid models and technology solutions that will allow grid operators to ensure
    grid stability and ensure cleaner, affordable and reliable power. It also provides
    recommendations to industry leaders, policy makers and the IEC community.<br />\r\n<br
    />\r\nThe White Paper was prepared by the IEC Market Strategy Board (<a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/msb\">MSB</a>)
    advanced network operation project team with major contributions from Tokyo Electric
    Power Company (TEPCO) and project partner GridOptimize. Supporting contributions
    came from Huawei Technologies, FZSONICK SA, Waseda University, Toshiba Energy
    Systems & Solutions, and State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).<br />\r\n<br
