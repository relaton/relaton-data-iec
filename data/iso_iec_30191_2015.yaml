abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 30191:2015 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm recordable optical disk with a capacity of 100,0 Gbytes, 128,0 Gbytes
    or 200,0 Gbytes. It specifies the quality of the recorded and unrecorded signals,
    the format of the data and the recording method, thereby allowing for information
    interchange by means of such disks. User data can be written once and read many
    times using a non-reversible method. This disk is identified as BD Recordable
    disk.<p>This International Standard specifies</p>\r\nthree related but different
    Types of this disk,<br />\r\nthe conditions for conformance,<br />\r\nthe environments
    in which the disk is to be operated and stored,<br />\r\nthe mechanical and physical
    characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange between data
    processing systems,<br />\r\nthe format of the information on the disk, including
    the physical disposition of the Tracks and Sectors,<br />\r\nthe error correcting
    codes and the coding method used,<br />\r\nthe characteristics of the signals
    recorded on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the data from the
    disk.<p>ISO/IEC 30191:2015 provides for interchange of disks between disk drives.
    Together with a standard for volume and file structure, it provides for full data
    interchange between data processing systems.</p>"
