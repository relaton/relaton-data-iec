  content: "<p>This document specifies broadcast authentication protocols, which are
    protocols that provide data integrity and entity authentication in a broadcast
    setting, i.e. a setting with one sender transmitting messages to many receivers.
    To provide entity authentication, there needs to be a pre-existing infrastructure
    which links the sender to a cryptographic secret. The establishment of such an
    infrastructure is beyond the scope of this document.</p>"
