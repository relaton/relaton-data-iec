abstract:
- content: "IEC 60312-1:2010+A1:2011(E) applicable for measurements of the performance
    of dry vacuum cleaners for household use in or under conditions similar to those
    in households. The purpose of this document is to specify essential performance
    characteristics of dry vacuum cleaners being of interest to the users and to describe
    methods for measuring these characteristics. Due to influence of environmental
    conditions, variations in time, origin of test materials and proficiency of the
    operator, most of the described test methods will give more reliable results when
    applied for comparative testing of a number of appliances at the same time, in
    the same laboratory and by the same operator. This document is not intended for
    battery-operated vacuum cleaners. For safety requirements, reference is made to
    IEC 60335-1 and IEC 60335-2-2.<br /><a href=\"http://www.iec.ch/webstore/freepubs/iec60312-1-AnnexA{ed1.0}en.pdf\">Click
    here to access to information on suppliers of test materials and details of test
    equipment. This information is given for the convenience of users of this International
    Standard and does not constitute an endorsement by IEC of the suppliers named.
    This information will be continuously updated.<strong>This consolidated version
    consists of the first edition (2010)   \nand its amendment 1 (2011). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in\naddition to this publication.</strong>"
