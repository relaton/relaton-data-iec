abstract:
- content: "IEC 61967-8:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61967-8:2023
    defines a method for measuring the electromagnetic radiated emission from an integrated
    circuit (IC) using an IC stripline. The IC being evaluated is mounted on an EMC
    test board (PCB) between the active conductor and the ground plane of the IC stripline
    arrangement. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) frequency range of 150 kHz to
    3 GHz was deleted from the scope;<br />\r\nb) extension of upper usable frequency
    to 6 GHz or higher as long as the defined requirements are fulfilled."
