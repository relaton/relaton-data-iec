abstract:
- content: "IEC 60947-2:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60947-2:2016 applies
    to circuit-breakers, the main contacts of which are intended to be connected to
    circuits, the rated voltage of<br />\r\nwhich does not exceed 1 000 V a.c. or
    1 500 V d.c.; it also contains additional requirements for integrally fused circuit-breakers.
    This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2006,
    Amendment 1:2009 and Amendment 2:2013. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant additions with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- tests for verification of selectivity in Annex A
    (see A.5.3);<br />\r\n- critical load current tests for d.c. circuit-breakers
    (see 8.3.9);<br />\r\n- new Annex P for circuit-breakers for use in photovoltaic
    applications;<br />\r\n- new Annex R for residual-current circuit-breakers with
    automatic reclosing functions.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of November
    2016 have been included in this copy."
