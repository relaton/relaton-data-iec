abstract:
- content: "This standard gives guidance on establishing a decision-making framework
    for sharing data and information services in smart cities.<br />\r\nIt covers:<br
    />\r\na) types of data in smart cities;<br />\r\nb) establishing a data sharing
    culture;<br />\r\nc) data value chain - roles and responsibilities;<br />\r\nd)
    purposes for data use;<br />\r\ne) assessing data states;<br />\r\nf) defining
    access rights for data; and<br />\r\ng) data formats/format of transportation.<br
    />\r\nThis standard aims to support the sharing of data and information services
    within cities. For some cities there will also be a need to establish specific
    data sharing agreements, particularly where data is being shared by multiple organizations
    at once.<br />\r\nThis standard supports a transparent approach to making decisions
    and creating specific data sharing agreements in order to fully realise the benefits
    and value of data and information services in a city.<br />\r\nMissing data or
    misinterpretation of data can lead to the wrong actions being taken by city decision-makers.
    A decision-making framework for sharing data can help ensure that they have the
    best overall data on which to base decisions.<br />\r\nThis standard does not
    cover:<br />\r\na) national security issues;<br />\r\nb) good practice for use
    of data by the citizen;<br />\r\nc) existing interoperability agreements between
    cities;<br />\r\nd) defining application programming interfaces (API) networks;
    or<br />\r\ne) any data sharing rules and regulations specific to a particular
    jurisdiction. It is assumed that a security-minded approach to data sharing is
    used by cities.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Further details on the areas not covered in this
    standard, including information on relevant standards publications, are given
    in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis standard is for use by decision-makers in smart cities
    from the public, private and third sectors. It is also of interest to any city
    organization wishing to share data."
