    class="MsoBodyText">This standard aims to support the sharing of data and information
    services within cities. For some cities there will also be a need to establish
    specific data sharing agreements, particularly where data is being shared by multiple
    organizations at once.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This standard supports a transparent
    approach to making decisions and creating specific data sharing agreements in
    order to fully realise the benefits and value of data and information services
    in a city.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">Missing data or misinterpretation of data
    can lead to the wrong actions being taken by city decision-makers. A decision-making
    framework for sharing data can help ensure that they have the best overall data
    on which to base decisions.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This standard does not cover:</p><p
