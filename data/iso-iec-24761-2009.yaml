  content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24761:2009 specifies the structure and the data elements of
    Authentication Context for Biometrics (ACBio), which is used for checking the
    validity of the result of a biometric verification process executed at a remote
    site. ISO/IEC 24761:2009 allows any ACBio instance to accompany any data item
    that is involved in any biometric process related to verification and enrolment.
    The specification of ACBio is applicable not only to single modal biometric verification
    but also to multimodal fusion. ISO/IEC 24761:2009 specifies the cryptographic
    syntax of an ACBio instance. The cryptographic syntax of an ACBio instance is
    based on an abstract Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS) schema whose concrete
    values can be represented using either a compact binary encoding or a human-readable
    XML encoding. ISO/IEC 24761:2009 does not define protocols to be used between
    entities such as biometric processing units, claimant, and validator. Its concern
    is entirely with the content and encoding of the ACBio instances for the various
    processing activities.</p>"
