    <p>This International Standard specifies the Wireless Terminal Location Registration supplementary service (SS-WTLR) and the</p>
    <p>Wireless Terminal Information Exchange additional network feature (ANF-WTINFO), which are applicable to various basic</p>
    <p>services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p>
    <p>The Wireless Terminal Location Registration Supplementary Service (SS-WTLR) enables a WTM user to register at, or</p>
    <p>de-register from, the current location within the PISN. The ability to register at different locations in the PISN at different times</p>
    <p>enables the WTM user to maintain the provided services (including the ability to make and receive calls) at different access</p>
    <p>points. De-registration is used to inform the PISN that the WTM user is temporarily unable to make use of the provided</p>
    <p>services (including the receipt of incoming calls).</p>
    <p>The Information Exchange Additional Network Feature (ANF-WTINFO) allows to exchange information about a WTLR user</p>
    <p>between the Home Data Base and the Visitor Data Base.</p>
    <p>Supplementary service and additional network feature specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method</p>
    <p>described in CCITT Recommendation I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of</p>
    <p>SS-WTLR and ANF-WTINFO. The stage 1 specification (clause 6 and 7) specifies the service/feature as seen by users of</p>
    <p>PISNs. The stage 2 specification (clause 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the service/feature and the</p>
    <p>information flows between them.</p>
