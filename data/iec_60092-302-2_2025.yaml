abstract:
- content: "IEC 60092-302-2:2025 defines the specific requirements of low voltage
    marine power switchgear and controlgear assemblies (mpsc-assemblies) as follows:<br
    />\r\n- stationary assemblies with enclosure for which the rated voltage does
    not exceed 1 000 V AC or 1500 V DC;<br />\r\n- assemblies intended for use in
    conjunction with the power generation, distribution and conversion of electric
    energy, and for the control of electric energy consuming equipment.<br />\r\nDue
    to the marine application and the risks associated with loss of power, additional
    safety factors have been applied to minimise the risk of failure, such as applying
    an additional safety factor on clearance distances.<br />\r\nThis document applies
    to all assemblies whether they are designed, manufactured and verified on a one-off
    basis or fully standardised and manufactured in quantity.<br />\r\nEither the
    manufacture or assembly, or both, of the MPSC assembly can be carried out by others
    than the original manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis document does not apply to individual
    devices and self-contained components, such as motor starters, fuse switches,
    electronic equipment, which comply with the relevant product standards.<br />\r\nThis
    second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2019. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    amended and updated in line with, and correctly referenced to the updated clauses
    of IEC 61439-1:2020 and IEC 61439-2:2020;<br />\r\nb) explanation of the need
    to special consideration for marine applications added;<br />\r\nc) Figure 201
    updated;<br />\r\nd) adjustment has been made to the \"safety factors\" for creepage
    and clearance distances."
