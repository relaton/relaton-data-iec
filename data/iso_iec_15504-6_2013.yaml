abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 15504 provides a framework for the assessment of process capability.
    This framework can be used by organizations involved in planning, managing, monitoring,
    controlling and improving the acquisition, supply, development, operation, evolution
    and support of products and services. ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008 describes an exemplar
    Process Assessment Model (PAM) for system life cycle processes, conformant with
    the ISO/IEC 15504-2 requirements for a PAM. The ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008 exemplar
    PAM is derived from the Process Reference Model (PRM) defined in ISO/IEC 15288,
    associated with the process attributes defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2. The resulting
    PAM is a two-dimensional PAM which provides indicators for guidance on the interpretation
    of the process purposes and outcomes as defined in ISO/IEC 15288, and the process
    attributes as defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2. It can be used to perform a process
    assessment conformant with ISO/IEC 15504-2, either in the context of a process
    improvement programme or for process capability determination. ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008
    describes - the overall structure of the PAM with its process dimension (derived
    from ISO/IEC 15288) and capability dimension (derived from the measurement framework
    defined in ISO/IEC 15504-2); - process performance indicators (base practices
    and work products) for 26 processes drawn from ISO/IEC 15288; - process capability
    indicators (generic practices, generic resources and generic work products) which
    characterize, for any process attribute of the capability dimension, what are
    the expected characteristics that demonstrate achievement of that process attribute.
    ISO/IEC TR 15504-6:2008 also includes - the demonstration of conformity of the
    PAM with the requirements of ISO/IEC 15504-2; - the detailed characteristics of
    the work products and the generic work products; - guidance for adapting the PAM
    and defining additional assessment indicators.
