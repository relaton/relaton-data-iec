abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 61850-7-6:2024, which is a Technical Report, is focused on building
    application / function profiles and specifies a methodology to define Basic Application
    Profiles (BAPs), in textual documents (edition 1, 2019) or in a machine processable
    SCL format (current edition). These Basic Application Profiles provide a framework
    for interoperable interaction within or between typical substation automation
    functions. BAPs are intended to define a subset of features of IEC 61850 in order
    to facilitate interoperability in a modular way in practical applications.<br
    />\r\nIt is the intention of this document to provide a common and generic way
    to describe the functional behavior of a specific application function in the
    domain of power utility automation systems as a common denominator of various
    possible interpretations/implementations of using IEC 61850.<br />\r\nThe guidelines
    in this document are based on the functional definitions of:<br />\r\n• IEC 61850-5,
    Communication requirements for functions and device models, which gives a comprehensive
    overview of all application functions needed in a state-of-the-art substation
    automation implementation.<br />\r\n• IEC TR 61850-7-500, Basic information and
    communication structure – Use of logical nodes for modelling application functions
    and related concepts and guidelines for substations, which illustrates and explains
    application functions for the substation/protection domain of Logical Nodes in
    modelling simple and complex functions, to improve common understanding in modelling
    and data exchange, and finally to lead to interoperable implementations.<br />\r\n•
    IEC TR 61850-90-3, Using IEC 61850 for condition monitoring diagnosis and analysis,
    which gives use cases and data modelling for condition monitoring diagnosis and
    analysis functions for substation and power grid facilities.<br />\r\n• IEC TR
    61850-90-30, IEC 61850 Function Modelling in SCL, which describes extensions of
    the SCL Substation/Process Section allowing to create a comprehensive, IED and
    hardware independent specification of an IEC 61850 based power system.<br />\r\nThis
    document does not describe the applications and respective implementation requirements;
    the focus is on their typical information exchange including data and communication
    services and engineering conventions.<br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and
    replaces the first edition published in 2019. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) New Clause 5 added to describe
    the way to express Basic Application Profile in SCL files;<br />\r\nb) New Annex
    F and Annex G added to list specific use cases and roles of the Concept Definition
    Tool."
