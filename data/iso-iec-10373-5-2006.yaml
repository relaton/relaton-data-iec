    <p>ISO 10373 defines test methods for characteristics of identification cards as defined in ISO/IEC 7810. Each test method is cross-referenced to one or more base standards, which may be ISO/IEC 7810 or one or more of the supplementary standards that define the information storage technologies employed in identification cards applications.</p>
    <p>Criteria for acceptability do not form part of ISO 10373 but will be found in the International Standards mentioned above.</p>
    <p>Test methods defined in ISO 10373 are intended to be performed separately. A given card is not required to pass through all the tests sequentially.</p>
    <p>ISO 10373-1 deals with test methods which are common to one or more card technologies and other parts deal with other technology-specific tests.</p>
    <p>ISO 10373-5:2006 deals with test methods which are specific to optical memory card technology. </p>
