  content: IEC 61169-47:2012(E) is part of the IEC 61169 series, and provides information
    and rules for the preparation of detail specifications (DS) for RF coaxial connectors
    with clamp coupling, typically for use in 75 ohm cable networks (type F-Quick).
    This specification indicates the recommended performance characteristics to be
    considered when writing a DS and covers test schedules and inspection requirements.
