abstract:
- content: 'Provides a basic description of the methods and means (e.g., instrumentation)
    for measuring responses arising from high-power transient electromagnetic parameters.
    These responses can include: - the electric (E) and/or magnetic (H) fields (e.g.,
    incident fields or incident plus scattered fields within a system under test);
    - the current I (e.g., induced by a transient field or within a system under test);
    - the voltage V (e.g., induced by a transient field or within a system under test);
    - the charge Q induced on a cable or other conductor. These measured quantities
    are generally complicated time-dependent waveforms, which can be described approximately
    by several scalar parameters, or "observables". These parameters include: - the
    peak amplitude of the response, - the waveform rise-time, - the pulse width, and
    - mathematically defined norms obtained from the waveform. This International
    Standard provides information on the measurement of these waveforms and on the
    mathematical determination of the characterizing parameters. It does not provide
    information on specific level requirements for testing. It has the status of a
    basic EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide 107.'
