abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 18121:2015 defines the framework for IT standards and specifications
    on virtual experiments supporting IT-enhanced learning, education and training.
    It is based on implementations of standards and specifications that are used to
    support virtual experiment, development, evaluation and management that rely on
    ITLET.<br />\r\nThis ISO/IEC TR 18121:2015<br />\r\n- provides a framework that
    can be used for virtual experiment systems that rely on ITLET,<br />\r\n- determines
    the categories of different virtual experiment standards and specifications and
    their relationships to facilitate their integration,<br />\r\n- promotes the appropriate
    design and application of virtual experiment components so that IT systems that
    are being used are reusable, low cost, and more broadly applicable,<br />\r\n-
    indicates considerations to be taken into account when developing ITLET systems
    that are being developed or used to support virtual experiment systems,<br />\r\n-
    provides sample architecture of a virtual experiment system framework that can
    be used to support further development of virtual experiments,<br />\r\n- illustrates
    various roles that different actors can have at various points within the virtual
    experiment system,<br />\r\n- demonstrates how standards and specifications that
    support virtual experiments can be combined to form the basis for future work
    and implementations.<br />\r\nThe following aspects are not addressed in this
    ISO/IEC TR 18121:2015:<br />\r\n- specifications of the implementation details
    of virtual experiment systems;<br />\r\n- accessibility;<br />\r\n- privacy;<br
    />\r\n- security."
