  content: ISO/IEC 29341-14-12:2011(E) describes a service template which is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0. It defines a service type referred
    to herein as ContentDirectory service. The purpose of the ContentDirectory service
    is to allow the server device provide a uniform mechanism for UI devices to browse
    the content on the server and to obtain detailed information about object individual
    content. The ContentDirectory service additionally provides a lookup/storage service
    that allows clients to locate (and possibly store) individual objects (for example,
    songs, movies, pictures, etc) that the (server) device is capable of providing.
