abstract:
- content: "<p>This part of ISO/IEC 8859 specifies a set of 183</p><p>coded graphic
    characters identified as Latin/Thai</p><p>alphabet.</p><p>This set of coded graphic
    characters is intended for</p><p>use in data and text processing applications
    and</p><p>also for information interchange.</p><p>The set contains graphic characters
    used for general</p><p>purpose applications in typical office environments in</p><p>at
    least the following languages:</p><p>Thai, English and Latin.</p><p>Some of the
    characters in this set are combining</p><p>characters (see clause 6).</p><p>This
    set of coded graphic characters may be</p><p>regarded as a version of an 8-bit
    code according to</p><p>ISO/IEC 2022 or ISO/IEC 4873 at level 1.</p><p>This part
    of ISO/IEC 8859 may not be used in</p><p>conjunction with any other parts of ISO/IEC
    8859. If</p><p>coded characters from more than one part are to be</p><p>used together,
    by means of code extension</p><p>techniques, the equivalent coded character sets</p><p>from
    ISO/IEC 10367 or their corresponding G1 sets</p><p>from?ISO International Register
    of Coded Character</p><p>Sets to be used with escape sequences', should be</p><p>used
    instead within a version of ISO/IEC 4873 at</p><p>level 2 or level 3.</p><p>The
    coded characters in this set may be used in</p><p>conjunction with coded control
    functions selected</p><p>from ISO/IEC 6429. However, control functions are</p><p>not
    used to create composite graphic symbols from</p><p>two or more graphic characters
    (see clause 6).</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>? ISO/IEC 8859 is not intended for
    use with</p><p>Telematic services defined by ITU-T. If information coded</p><p>according
    to ISO/IEC 8859 is to be transferred to such</p><p>services, it will have to conform
    to the requirements of</p><p>those services at the access-point.</p>"
