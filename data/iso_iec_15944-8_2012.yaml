abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15944-8:2012 has been developed to support modelling generic international requirements
    for identifying and providing privacy protection of personal information throughout
    any kind of information and communications technology (ICT) based business transaction
    where the individual has the role of a buyer. It provides users and designers
    with a methodology and tools addressing requirements imposed by jurisdictional
    domains.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-8:2012 takes the \"business operational view\"
    (BOV) aspects developed in ISO/IEC 14662, together with, in particular, ISO/IEC
    15944-1 and ISO/IEC 15944-5 as well as many other international references.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15944 models the requirements of jurisdictional domains as external
    constraints upon the creation, use, interchange, and information life-cycle management
    of data. ISO/IEC 15944-8:2012 addresses the wider context of the public policy
    requirements of jurisdictional domains controlling the use of personal information
    (PI). These include regulations for consumer protection, privacy protection, individual
    accessibility, etc.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-8:2012 identifies and expands upon
    eleven generic, primitive, international principles that have been associated
    with privacy protection by international, regional, and UN member states' requirements.
    It models them with respect to the \"collaboration space\" of a business transaction
    and commitment exchange involving an individual acting in the role of a \"buyer\".
    It provides principles and rules governing the establishment, management and use
    of identifiers of that individual, including the use of legally recognized names
    (LRNs), recognized individual identity (rii), and methods of non-identification
    such as the use of anonymization and pseudonymization of personal information.<br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15944-8:2012 also sets out principles governing information life-cycle
    management (ILCM) as well as the rules and associated coded domains for obtaining
    informed consent for collection, specifying state changes, records retention,
    record deletion and related matters in support of privacy protection requirements."
