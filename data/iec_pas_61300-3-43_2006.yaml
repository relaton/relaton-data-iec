abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61300 describes the method for measuring the mode transfer
    function (MTF) to be used in characterizing the launch conditions for measurements
    of attenuation and or return loss of multimode passive components, according to
    IEC 61300-1 and IEC 61300-3-4. The MTF may be measured at the operational wavelengths.
