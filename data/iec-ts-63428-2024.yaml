  content: "IEC TS 63428:2024 describes principles and provides guidance on how to
    embed material circularity aspects into the design and development of products.<br
    />\r\nThis includes making efficient use of materials and closing material flows
    in design and production, extending the lifetime of products through increased
    durability and enabling parts and materials to be reused or recycled at end-of-life.<br
    />\r\n• Closing the material flows includes the use of recycled content and reused
    parts.<br />\r\n• Durability extensions include such measures as to improve reliability
    and maintenance, enable and facilitate repair, provide updates and upgrades, refurbish
    and reuse.<br />\r\n• Improvements in material recyclability, parts reuse, and
    remanufacturing are possible through measures such as design for disassembly,
    separability of materials, choice of materials, traceability of materials, and
    durability of parts.<br />\r\nThis document builds on the jointly published (ISO
    and IEC) document, IEC 62430:2019 for requirements for environmentally conscious
    design (ECD) processes, and it supplements ECD by adding more specific guidance
    on the aspects of material circularity and material efficiency.<br />\r\nThis
    document only deals with material circularity of products. Economic, social and
    energy aspects are excluded from the scope of this document.<br />\r\nThis document
    is applicable to all electrotechnical products including goods and services."
