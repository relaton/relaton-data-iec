  content: "IEC 62153-4-8:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 62153-4-8:2018
    specifies a test method for determining the capacitive coupling admittance, the
    capacitive coupling impedance and the coupling capacitance by the use of a triaxial
    set-up in a similar manner as for the measurement of the transfer impedance (see
    IEC 62153-4-3). Most cables have negligible capacitive coupling; however, in the
    case of cables with loose single-braids, the coupling through the holes in the
    screen shall be determined by the measurement of the capacitive coupling admittance.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2006.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    use of the triaxial set-up in a similar manner as for the measurement of the transfer
    impedance (see IEC 62153-4-3),<br />\r\nb) use of vector network analyser instead
    of capacitance bridge or pulse generator."
