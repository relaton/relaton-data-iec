  content: "IEC PAS 63595:2025 defines wireless communication systems based on 5G
    and beyond technologies applicable for industrial process measurement and control
    applications. Based on common terminology, generic descriptions, and use cases,
    this document provides requirements for related users, designers, and device manufacturers.<br
    />\r\nThis document considers cellular wireless communication systems according
    to the specifications of the terrestrial radio interfaces of International Mobile
    Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020) developed by 3GPP as 5G Release 15 and beyond
    (see ITU-R M.2150-1:02/2022).<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Non-cellular professional stand-alone
    wireless communication systems, also called NR+, are not considered.<br />\r\nNOTE
    2 The PAS is a pre-standard and can be converted into a series of documents for
    users, designers, and device manufacturers.<br />\r\nNOTE In accordance with ISO/IEC
    Directives, Part 1, IEC PASs are automatically withdrawn after 4 years."
