abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15938-15:2019 This document addresses descriptor technology for
    search and retrieval applications, i.e. for visual content matching in video.
    Visual content matching includes matching of views of large and small objects
    and scenes, with robustness to partial occlusions as well as changes in vantage
    point, camera parameters and lighting conditions. The objects of interest comprise
    planar or non-planar, rigid or partially rigid, textured or partially textured
    objects, but exclude the identification of people and faces. The databases can
    be large, for example broadcast archives or videos available on the internet.
    Such applications thus require video descriptors that enable matching with smaller
    descriptor sizes and shorter runtimes as compared to application enabled by single-frame
    (still image) descriptors (e.g. CVDS, ISO/IEC 15938-13) in the video domain.<br
    />\r\nCompact descriptors for video analysis for search and retrieval applications:<br
    />\r\n- enable design of interoperable object instance search applications;<br
    />\r\n- minimize the size of video descriptors;<br />\r\n- ensure high matching
    performances of objects (in terms of accuracy and complexity);<br />\r\n- enable
    efficient implementation of those functionalities on professional or embedded
    systems.<br />\r\nThis document provides a complementary tool to the suite of
    existing standards, such as ISO/IEC 15938-13."
