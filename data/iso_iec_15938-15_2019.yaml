abstract:
- content: "<p>This document addresses descriptor technology for search and retrieval
    applications, i.e. for visual content matching in video. Visual content matching
    includes matching of views of large and small objects and scenes, with robustness
    to partial occlusions as well as changes in vantage point, camera parameters and
    lighting conditions. The objects of interest comprise planar or non-planar, rigid
    or partially rigid, textured or partially textured objects, but exclude the identification
    of people and faces. The databases can be large, for example broadcast archives
    or videos available on the internet. Such applications thus require video descriptors
    that enable matching with smaller descriptor sizes and shorter runtimes as compared
    to application enabled by single-frame (still image) descriptors (e.g. CVDS, ISO/IEC
    15938-13) in the video domain.</p><p>Compact descriptors for video analysis for
    search and retrieval applications:</p><p>— enable design of interoperable object
    instance search applications;</p><p>— minimize the size of video descriptors;</p><p>—
    ensure high matching performances of objects (in terms of accuracy and complexity);</p><p>—
    enable efficient implementation of those functionalities on professional or embedded
    systems.</p><p>This document provides a complementary tool to the suite of existing
    standards, such as ISO/IEC 15938-13.</p>"
