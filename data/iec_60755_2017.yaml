- content: "IEC 60775:2017(E) provides general minimum requirements, recommendations
    and information for the drafting of standards on residual current operated protective
    devices (hereinafter referred to as residual current devices, \"RCDs\"). It applies
    to any device providing residual current protection intended primarily for protection
    against electric shock hazard.<br />\r\nThis first edition cancels and replaces
    IEC TR 60755 published in 2008 and constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to IEC
    TR 60755:<br />\r\na. restructuration of the document, as a Group Safety Publication,
    in compliance with Guide 104;<br />\r\nb. introduction of classification for type
    F RCDs;<br />\r\nc. introduction of Clause 9 for tests of RCDs (operating characteristics,
    electrical endurance, behaviour in short-circuit conditions, trip-free mechanism,
    test device, surges, reliability, EMC).<br />\r\nIt has the status of a group
    safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
