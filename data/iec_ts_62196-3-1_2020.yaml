- content: "IEC TS 62196-3-1:2020(E) applies to accessories and cable assemblies with
    the same configuration as specified in IEC 62196-3:2014 with rated operating voltage
    not exceeding 1 500 V DC and a rated current not exceeding 500 A that employ<br
    />\r\n- thermal sensing, or<br />\r\n- thermal transport and thermal sensing with
    the system architecture described in 4.101.<br />\r\nThese accessories and cable
    assemblies are intended to be used in conductive charging systems for circuits
    specified in IEC 61851-23.<br />\r\nNOTE Edition 2 of IEC 61851-23 is under development.<br
    />\r\nThe accessories covered by this document are intended to be used in charging
