  content: HES standards address both interoperability requirements, interconnectivity
    requirements and plug-compatibility requirements. Devices are described as interoperable
    if the functionality of the higher communication layers is such that commands
    can be exchanged and result in meaningful action. For interconnectivity it is
    sufficient to specify mechanical, electrical, and functional (lower layer protocol)
    characteristics such that devices can be connected on a shared transmission medium.
    Plug-compatibility includes both interoperability and interconnection. It usually
    implies that a particular interface is claimed for a particular purpose, where
    showing a certain interface implies interworking capabilities. This is particularly
    the case in the consumer environment where the availability of a particular plug
    on two pieces of equipment is generally understood to mean that the devices can
    be interconnected and will work together. This part of ISO/IEC 14543 addresses
    the architectural aspects of interfaces by introducing the concepts of Functional
    Groupings (FG) and Reference Points (RP). These concepts provide a means to describe
    modularity of a device, and hence serve as a basis for device interface standards
