abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-30-2:2017 defines the device for IOT Management and Control,
    which identifies Level 1 of the device named IOT Management and Control. This
    Publicly Available Specification is applicable to Standardized DCPs of the UPnP
    Forum which include this device.<br />\r\nThis device definition is compliant
    with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0 [1]. It defines a device type referred
    to herein as IOT Management and Control device.<br />\r\nThis specification defines
    a general-purpose device that can be used to instantiate a bridge or gateway device
    that is connected to Sensors and Actuators. This device implements a bridge between
    the UPnP network and Sensors/Actuators endpoints. It exposes services to check
    the status, and send and receive data from Sensors. Sensors/Actuators may be connected
    using a variety of transport protocols including Bluetooth, ZigBee and IEEE 11073."
