abstract:
- content: Provides procedures for measuring time-resolved chirp on laser transmitters.
    The calculation of alpha-factor, a measure of transient chirp, is derived from
    the measured TRC data. A means to verify the TRC setups and calculations and a
    review of laser modulation methods and the relationship of TRC to performance
    in a transmission system are also coverd.
