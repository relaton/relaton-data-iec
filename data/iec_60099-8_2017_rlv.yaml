abstract:
- content: "IEC 60099-8:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60099-8:2017
    covers metal-oxide surge arresters with external series gap (externally gapped
    line arresters (EGLA)) that are applied on overhead transmission and distribution
    lines, only to protect insulator assemblies from lightning-caused flashovers.
    This document defines surge arresters to protect the insulator assembly from lightning-caused
    over-voltages only. Therefore, and since metal-oxide resistors are not permanently
    connected to the line, the following items are not considered for this document:<br
    />\r\n- switching impulse spark-over voltage;<br />\r\n- residual voltage at steep
    current and switching current impulse;<br />\r\n- thermal stability;<br />\r\n-
    long-duration current impulse withstand duty;<br />\r\n- power-frequency voltage
    versus time characteristics of an arrester;<br />\r\n- disconnector test;<br />\r\n-
    aging duties by power-frequency voltage.<br />\r\nConsidering the particular design
    concept and the special application on overhead transmission and distribution
    lines, some unique requirements and tests are introduced, such as the verification
    test for coordination between insulator withstand and EGLA protective level, the
    follow current interrupting test, mechanical load tests, etc. Designs with the
    EGLA's external series gap installed in parallel to an insulator are not covered
    by this document. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2011. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\nThe Lightning discharge capability test has been completely re-written and
    re-named to Test to verify the repetitive charge transfer rating, Qrs with lightning
    discharges to reflect changes introduced in IEC 60099-4 Ed.3 (2014) regarding
    new methods for rating the energy and charge handling capability of metal-oxide
    arresters. In addition to testing to evaluate the performance of the MO resistors,
    procedures for evaluating the performance of the EGLA series gaps have been introduced.<br
    />\r\n- Omissions from Ed. 1 of this standard have been included, notably an RIV
    test and a means for determining the thermal time constant of the SUV portion
    of the EGLA.<br />\r\n- Definitions for new terms have been added<br />\r\n- A
    number of NOTES in Ed. 1 have been converted to normative requirements<br /><br
    />\r\nKeywords: externally gapped line arresters (EGLA), lightning-caused over-voltages"
