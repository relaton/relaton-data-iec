abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 24759:2017 specifies the methods to be used by testing laboratories
    to test whether the cryptographic module conforms to the requirements specified
    in ISO/IEC 19790:2012. The methods are developed to provide a high degree of objectivity
    during the testing process and to ensure consistency across the testing laboratories.<br
    />\r\nThis document also specifies the requirements for information that vendors
    provide to testing laboratories as supporting evidence to demonstrate their cryptographic
    modules' conformity to the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012.<br />\r\nVendors
    can use this document as guidance in trying to verify whether their cryptographic
    modules satisfy the requirements specified in ISO/IEC 19790:2012 before they apply
    to the testing laboratory for testing."
