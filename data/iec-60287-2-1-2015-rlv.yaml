  content: "IEC 60287-2-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 60287-2-1:2015 is
    solely applicable to the conditions of steady-state operation of cables at all
    alternating voltages, and direct voltages up to 5 kV, buried directly in the ground,
    in ducts, in troughs or in steel pipes, both with and without partial drying-out
    of the soil, as well as cables in air. The term \"steady state\" is intended to
    mean a continuous constant current (100 % load factor) just sufficient to produce
    asymptotically the maximum conductor temperature, the surrounding ambient conditions
    being assumed constant. This part of IEC 60287 provides formulae for thermal resistance.
    This second edition of IEC 60287-2-1 cancels and replaces the first edition, published
    in 1994, Amendment 1:2001, Amendment 2:2006 and Corrigendum 1:2008. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\na) inclusion of a reference to the use of finite element methods
    where analytical methods are not available for the calculation of external thermal
    resistance;<br />\r\nb) explanation about SL and SA type cables;<br />\r\nc) calculation
    method for T3 for unarmoured three-core cables with extruded insulation and individual
    copper tape screens on each core;<br />\r\nd) change of condition for X in 5.4;<br
    />\r\ne) inclusion of constants or installation conditions for water filled ducts
    in Table 4."
