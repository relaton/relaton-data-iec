abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 60870-5-604:2016(E) is available as IEC TS 60870-5-604:2016 RLV
    which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing all
    changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC
    TS 60870-5-604:2016(E) describes test cases for conformance testing of telecontrol
    equipment, Substation Automation Systems (SAS) and telecontrol systems, including
    front-end functions of SCADA, using the IEC 60870-5-104 companion standard and
    IEC 60870-5-6, Guidelines for conformance testing for the IEC 60870-5 companion
    standards. The use of this part of IEC 60870 facilitates interoperability by providing
    a standard method of testing protocol implementations. This new edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- resolution of ambiguities;<br />\r\n- refinement of some test cases to
    enhance operability between tested devices;<br />\r\n- addition of some test cases
    (mainly negative test cases)."
