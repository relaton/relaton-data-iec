  content: "This part of IEC 61000 provides guidance on principles which can be used
    as the basis for determining the requirements for the connection of fluctuating
    installations to MV, HV and EHV public power systems (LV installations are covered
    in other IEC documents). For the purposes of this report, a fluctuating installation
    means an installation (which may be a load or a generator) that produces voltage
    flicker and / or rapid voltage changes. The primary objective is to provide guidance
    to system operators or owners on engineering practices which will facilitate the
    provision of adequate service quality for all connected customers. In addressing
    installations, this document is not intended to replace equipment standards for
    emission limits. This report addresses the allocation of the capacity of the system
    to absorb disturbances. It does not address how to mitigate disturbances, nor
    does it address how the capacity of the system can be increased. Since the guidelines
    outlined in this report are necessarily based on certain simplifying assumptions,
    there is no guarantee that this approach will always provide the optimum solution
    for all flicker situations. The recommended approach should be used with flexibility
    and engineering judgment as far as engineering is concerned, when applying the
    given assessment procedures in full or in part. The system operator or owner is
    responsible for specifying requirements for the connection of fluctuating installations
    to the system. The fluctuating installation is to be understood as the customer's
    complete installation (i.e. including fluctuating and non fluctuating parts).
    Problems related to voltage fluctuations fall into two basic categories:<br />\r\n-
    Flicker effect from light sources as a result of voltage fluctuations;<br />\r\n-
    Rapid voltage changes even within the normal operational voltage tolerances are
    considered as a disturbing phenomenon.<br />\r\nThe report gives guidance for
    the coordination of the flicker emissions between different voltage levels in
    order to meet the compatibility levels at the point of utilisation. This report
    primarily focuses on controlling or limiting flicker, but a clause is included
    to address the limitation of rapid voltage changes. This second edition cancels
    and replaces the first edition published in 1996 and constitutes a technical revision.
    This new edition is significantly more streamlined than the original technical
    report (Edition 1), and reflects the experiences gained in the application of
    the first edition. This technical report has also been harmonised with IEC/TR
    61000-3-6 and IEC/TR 61000-3-13. This Technical Report has the status of a basic
    EMC publication in accordance with IEC Guide 107."
