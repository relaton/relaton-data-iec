abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 specifies the operating conditions of an integrated
    circuit card that provides a USB interface. An integrated circuit card with a
    USB interface is named USB-ICC.</p><p>ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 specifies</p><ul><li>the
    electrical conditions when a USB-ICC is operated by an interface device - for
    those contact fields that are not used, when the USB interface is applied;</li><li>the
    USB standard descriptors and the USB-ICC class specific descriptor;</li><li>the
    data transfer between host and USB-ICC using bulk transfers or control transfers;</li><li>the
    control transfers which allow two different protocols named version A and version
    B;</li><li>the (optional) interrupt transfers to indicate asynchronous events;</li><li>status
    and error conditions.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 provides two protocols
    for control transfers. This is to support the protocol T=0 (version A) or to use
    the transfer on APDU level (version B). ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 provides the state
    diagrams for the USB-ICC for each of the transfers (bulk transfers, control transfers
    version A and version B). Examples of possible sequences which the USB-ICC must
    be able to handle are given in an informative annex.</p>"
