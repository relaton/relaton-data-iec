abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 specifies the operating conditions of an integrated
    circuit card that provides a USB interface. An integrated circuit card with a
    USB interface is named USB-ICC.ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005 specifiesthe electrical conditions
    when a USB-ICC is operated by an interface device - for those contact fields that
    are not used, when the USB interface is applied;the USB standard descriptors and
    the USB-ICC class specific descriptor;the data transfer between host and USB-ICC
    using bulk transfers or control transfers;the control transfers which allow two
    different protocols named version A and version B;the (optional) interrupt transfers
    to indicate asynchronous events;status and error conditions.ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005
    provides two protocols for control transfers. This is to support the protocol
    T=0 (version A) or to use the transfer on APDU level (version B). ISO/IEC 7816-12:2005
    provides the state diagrams for the USB-ICC for each of the transfers (bulk transfers,
    control transfers version A and version B). Examples of possible sequences which
    the USB-ICC must be able to handle are given in an informative annex.
