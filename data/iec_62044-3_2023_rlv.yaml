abstract:
- content: "IEC 62044-3:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62044-3:2023
    specifies measuring methods for power loss and amplitude permeability of magnetic
    cores forming the closed magnetic circuits intended for use at high excitation
    levels in inductors, chokes, transformers and similar devices for power electronics
    applications. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2000. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:
    addition of Annex F and Annex G."
