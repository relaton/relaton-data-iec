    requirements for defining, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, maintaining
    and improving supplier and acquirer relationships.<br />\r\nThese requirements
    cover any procurement and supply of products and services, such as manufacturing
    or assembly, business process procurement, software and hardware components, knowledge
    process procurement, build-operate-transfer and cloud computing services.<br />\r\nThis
    document is applicable to all organizations, regardless of type, size and nature.<br
    />\r\nTo meet the requirements, it is expected that an organization has internally
    implemented a number of foundational processes or is actively planning to do so.
    These processes include, but are not limited to: business management, risk management,
    operational and human resources management, and information security."
