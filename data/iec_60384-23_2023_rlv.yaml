- content: "IEC 60384-23:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60384-23:2023
    is applicable to fixed surface mount capacitors for direct current, with metallized
    electrodes and polyethylene naphthalate dielectric for use in electronic equipment.
    These capacitors have metallized connecting pads or soldering strips and are intended
    to be mounted directly onto printed boards or onto substrates for hybrid circuits.
    These capacitors can have \"self-healing properties\" depending on conditions
    of use. They are primarily intended for applications where the AC component is
    small with respect to the rated voltage. This part of IEC 60384 specifies preferred
    ratings and characteristics, selects from IEC 60384‑1:2021 the appropriate quality
    assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and gives general performance
    requirements for this type of capacitor. Test severities and requirements specified
    in detail specifications referring to this sectional specification are of an equal
    or higher performance level. Lower performance levels are not permitted. Capacitors
    for electromagnetic interference suppression are not included, but are covered
    by IEC 60384‑14. This edition includes the following significant technical changes
    with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- this edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition: revision of
    all parts of the document based on the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2021, and harmonization
    with other similar kinds of documents;<br />\r\n- the document structure has been
    organized to follow new sectional specification structure decided in TC 40;<br
    />\r\n- revised tables and Clause 5 so as to prevent duplications and contradictions;<br
    />\r\n- in Subclause 5.2 (Mounting), the Subclauses 5.2.1, 5.2.2 and 5.2.3 have
    been added;<br />\r\n- in Subclause 5.5 (Shear test), the Subclauses 5.5.1 and
    5.5.2 have been added;<br />\r\n- in Subclause 5.14 (Component solvent resistance),
    the Subclauses 5.14.1 and 5.14.2 have been added. In Table 8 and Table A.2, test
    5.14 has been moved before 5.7.5 (Final inspections and requirements) in Group
    1A and in Subgroup C1;<br />\r\n- in Subclause 5.15 (Solvent resistance of marking),
    the Subclauses 5.15.1 and 5.15.2 have been added;<br />\r\n- tangent of loss angle
    measurement has been added to the resistance to soldering heat test;<br />\r\n-
    lot-by-lot and periodical inspection tables including requirements have been moved
    to Annex A;<br />\r\n- revised Inspection Level (IL) of A1 subgroup."
