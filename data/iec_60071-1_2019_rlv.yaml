abstract:
- content: "IEC 60071-1:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60071-1:2019
    applies to three-phase AC systems having a highest voltage for equipment above
    1 kV. It specifies the procedure for the selection of the rated withstand voltages
    for the phase-to-earth, phase-to-phase and longitudinal insulation of the equipment
    and the installations of these systems. It also gives the lists of the standard
    withstand voltages from which the rated withstand voltages are selected. This
    document describes that the selected withstand voltages are associated with the
    highest voltage for equipment. This association is for insulation co-ordination
    purposes only. The requirements for human safety are not covered by this document.
    Although the principles of this document also apply to transmission line insulation,
    the values of their withstand voltages can be different from the standard rated
    withstand voltages. The apparatus committees are responsible for specifying the
    rated withstand voltages and the test procedures suitable for the relevant equipment
    taking into consideration the recommendations of this document.<br />\r\nNOTE
    In IEC 60071-2, all rules for insulation coâ€‘ordination given in this document
    are justified in detail, in particular the association of the standard rated withstand
    voltages with the highest voltage for equipment. When more than one set of standard
    rated withstand voltages is associated with the same highest voltage for equipment,
    guidance is provided for the selection of the most suitable set.<br />\r\nThe
    main changes from the previous edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- all references
    are updated to current IEC standards, and the bibliography is deleted;<br />\r\n-
    some definitions are clarified in order to avoid overlapping and ensure clear
    understanding;<br />\r\n- letter symbols are changed and corrected in order to
    keep the consistency with relevant IEC standards;<br />\r\n- some titles are changed
    to clarify understanding (see Clauses A.2, A.3 and Annex B).<br />\r\nIt has the
    status of a horizontal standard in accordance with IEC Guide 108."
