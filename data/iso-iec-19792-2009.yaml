    <p>ISO/IEC 19792:2009 specifies the subjects to be addressed during a security evaluation of a biometric system.</p>
    <p>It covers the biometric-specific aspects and principles to be considered during the security evaluation of a biometric system. It does not address the non-biometric aspects which might form part of the overall security evaluation of a system using biometric technology (e.g. requirements on databases or communication channels). </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19792:2009 does not aim to define any concrete methodology for the security evaluation of biometric systems but instead focuses on the principal requirements. As such, the requirements in ISO/IEC 19792:2009 are independent of any evaluation or certification scheme and will need to be incorporated into and adapted before being used in the context of a concrete scheme.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19792:2009 defines various areas that are important to be considered during a security evaluation of a biometric system.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19792:2009 is relevant to both evaluator and developer communities.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>It specifies requirements for evaluators and provides guidance on performing a security evaluation of a biometric system.</li>
    <li>It serves to inform developers of the requirements for biometric security evaluations to help them prepare for security evaluations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although ISO/IEC 19792:2009 is independent of any specific evaluation scheme it could serve as a framework for the development of concrete evaluation and testing methodologies to integrate the requirements for biometric evaluations into existing evaluation and certification schemes. </p>
