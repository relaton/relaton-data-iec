abstract:
- content: "CISPR TR 16-4-4:2025 which is a Technical Report, establishes the CISPR
    model for the calculation of limits for the protection of radio services, based
    on data from the IEC Radio Services Database (RSD) and estimations of the input
    values for related probabilistic factors. This is part of the process of the derivation
    of disturbance limits in the radio frequency spectrum for use in publications
    containing emission requirements Application of this document leads to a frequency
    dependent limit result for a particular disturbance phenomenon and the considered
    product or product type establishing the technical basis in the CISPR limit specification
    procedure.<br />\r\nNOTEâ€ƒNon-technical parameters and terms that can be considered
    to influence a limit for inclusion in IEC publications are excluded from the modelling
    (see also Clause 4.6.5.3).<br />\r\nThis third edition cancels and replaces the
    second edition published in 2007, Amendment 1:2017 and Amendment 2:2020. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    full revision of the limit calculation model;<br />\r\nb) the content on statistics
    of complaints was taken from this publication and published as separate document
    (CISPR TR 16-4-6);<br />\r\nc) application cases/rationales were separated from
    the model and will be handled in another document to be drafted."
