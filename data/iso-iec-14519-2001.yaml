    <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
    <p>This standard is part of the POSIX ® series of standards for applications and user inter-faces to</p>
    <p>open systems. It defines the Ada language bindings as package specifications and accompanying textual</p>
    <p>descriptions of the application program interface (API). This standard supports application portability at the</p>
    <p>source code level through the binding between ISO 8652:1995 (Ada) and ISO/IEC 9945-1:1996 (IEEE Std</p>
    <p>1003.1-1996) (POSIX) as amended by IEEE P1003.1g/D6.6. Terminology and general requirements, process</p>
    <p>primitives, the process environment, files and directories, input and output primaries, device- and classspecific</p>
    <p>functions, language-specific services for Ada, system databases, synchronization, memory</p>
    <p>management, execution scheduling, clocks and timers, message passing, task management, the XTI and</p>
    <p>socket detailed network inter-faces, event management, network support functions, and protocol-specific</p>
    <p>mappings are covered. It also specifies behavior to support the binding that must be provided by the Ada.</p>
