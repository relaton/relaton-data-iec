abstract:
- content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314, is intended
    for use in a high-performance general purpose multi-node network and is designed
    for efficient operation with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token
    Ring architecture with optical fibre as the transmission medium. FDDI provides
    for hundreds of nodes operating over an extent of tens of kilometres. Station
    Management (SMT) specifies the local portion of the system management application
    process for FDDI, including the control required for proper operation of a node
    in an FDDI ring. SMT provides services such as connection management, station
    insertion and removal, station initialization, configuration management, fault
    isolation and recovery, communications protocol for external authority, scheduling
    policies, and collection of statistics.
