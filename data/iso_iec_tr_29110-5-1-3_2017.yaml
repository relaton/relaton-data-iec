abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 provides management and engineering guide
    to the intermediate profile described in terms of business management, project
    management, software implementation and acquisition processes.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR
    29110-5-1-3:2017 is applicable to Very Small Entities (VSEs). VSEs are enterprises,
    organizations, departments or projects having up to 25 people. The life cycle
    processes described in the ISO/IEC 29110 series are not intended to preclude or
    discourage their use by organizations bigger than VSEs.</p><p>ISO/IEC 29110?4-1
    identifies the requirements applicable to the tasks and work products described
    in this document.</p><p>ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 has been developed using the
    management and engineering guide of the Basic profile and by modifying and adding
    elements (e.g. process, task, work product, role) for VSEs involved in the development
    of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 applies for VSEs developing non-critical software.</p><p>Using
    this document, VSEs can obtain the following benefits:</p><p>- the management
    and monitoring of more than one project in parallel with more than one work team;</p><p>-
    reuse existing software components (e.g. code and document) in new projects;</p><p>-
    continuously measure projects and improve processes.</p><p>Once the software,
    developed by a VSE, has been accepted by their customers, the VSE that wants to
    provide after delivery services can refer to ISO/IEC TR 29110-5-3.[1]</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 is targeted to VSEs which are familiar with ISO/IEC TR 29110â€‘5-1-2
    for their software development projects and are involved in the development of
    more than one project in parallel with more than one work team.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 29110-5-1-3:2017 is intended to be used with any lifecycles, processes, techniques
    and methods that enhance the VSEs customer satisfaction and productivity.</p><p>[1]
