abstract:
- content: "IEC 61097-4:2024 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 61097-4:2024 edition 4.0 and the previous IEC 61097-4:2012+AMD1:2016+AMD2:2019
    CSV edition 3.2. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 80 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61097-4:2024 specifies the performance requirements
    and methods of testing for Inmarsat-C ship earth stations (SES) capable of transmitting
    and receiving direct-printing communications, and for enhanced group call (EGC)
    receivers, for use in the GMDSS and for use for long-range identification and
    tracking (LRIT). The available variants are:<br />\r\nClass 0: An EGC receiver,
    either stand-alone or an element of a GMDSS installation in accordance with the
    Inmarsat design and installation guidelines (DIGs) for GMDSS installations.<br
    />\r\nClass 1: A basic SES providing shore-to-ship and ship-to-shore message transfer
    only.<br />\r\nClass 2: As class 1 but with EGC as an alternative to shore-to-ship
    transfer using a shared receiver.<br />\r\nClass 3: As class 1 but with EGC using
    an independent receiver.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 The 34th session of the IMO Sub-Committee
    on Radiocommunications decided that class 2 equipment would be adequate to provide
    sufficient availability for the reception of maritime safety information for the
    GMDSS.<br />\r\nThis document complies with IMO performance requirements stated
    in the normative references, Inmarsat technical characteristics and test procedures,
    and IEC 60945 general requirements except where modifications are explicitly stated
    in this document. Technical characteristics essential to GMDSS and LRIT operation
    as defined by the IMO are identified.<br />\r\nAll text of this document, whose
    wording is identical to that in IMO SOLAS Convention 1974 as amended in 1988 and
    Resolutions MSC.513(105), MSC.263(84) and MSC.306(87) is printed in italics and
    reference made to the Resolution/Recommendation and subclause number.<br />\r\nThis
    document covers equipment construction and testing. Matters relating to installation
    can be found in the Inmarsat Maritime design and installation guidelines (see
    Bibliography). Those to be found in IMO Resolutions MSC.513(105), MSC.263(84)
    and MSC.306(87) are reproduced in Annex A.<br />\r\nResponsibility for type approval
    of Inmarsat-C and Inmarsat-EGC is vested in Inmarsat by IMO Resolutions MSC.513(105)
    and MSC.306(87) (see 4.2.1). Therefore, this document does not reproduce Inmarsat
    test procedures in full but refers to where they are given in Inmarsat documentation
    cited in the normative references to this document (Annex C).<br />\r\nNOTE 2
    For the purposes of this document the terms Inmarsat C, Inmarsat-C, Inmarsat Standard-C,
    Standard-C refer to the same equipment."
