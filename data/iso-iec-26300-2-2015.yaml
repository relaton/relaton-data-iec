    <p>ISO/IEC 26300-2:2015 the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version 1.2 specification. It defines a formula language for OpenDocument documents, which is also called OpenFormula.</p>
    <p>OpenFormula is a specification of an open format for exchanging recalculated formulas between office applications, in particular, formulas in spreadsheet documents. OpenFormula defines data types, syntax, and semantics for recalculated formulas, including predefined functions and operations.</p>
    <p>Using OpenFormula allows document creators to change the office application they use, exchange formulas with others (who may use a different application), and access formulas far in the future, with confidence that the recalculated formulas in their documents will produce equivalent results if given equivalent inputs.</p>
    <p>OpenFormula is intended to be a supporting document to the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) format, particularly for defining its attributes table:formula and text:formula. It can also be used in other circumstances where a simple, easy-to-read infix text notation is desired for exchanging recalculated formulas.</p>
