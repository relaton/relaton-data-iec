  content: "IEC 61332:2026 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61332:2026
    specifies classification rules for soft ferrite materials used in inductive components
    (inductors and transformers) fulfilling the requirements of the electronic industries.<br
    />\r\nThis document addresses the following issues for ferrite suppliers and users:<br
    />\r\n- cross-reference between materials from multiple suppliers;<br />\r\n-
    assistance to users in understanding the published technical data in catalogues
    when comparing multiple suppliers;<br />\r\n- guidance to users in selecting the
    most applicable material for each application;<br />\r\n- setting of nomenclature
    for IEC standards relating to ferrite;<br />\r\n- establishing uniformed benchmarks
    for manufacturers for performance in new development of materials.<br />\r\nThe
    numerical values given in this document are typical values of the parameters (properties)
    of the related materials. Direct translation from the material specification into
    the core specification is not always easy or possible.<br />\r\nEvery detailed
    material and core specification should be agreed upon between suppliers and users.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) added PW2c and PW3c in subclasses PW2 and
    PW3 respectively in Table 3;<br />\r\nb) added the column of BS in Table 3;<br
    />\r\nc) added a smaller size of the test core (Ø 12,7 mm × Ø 7,5 mm × 7 mm) for
    higher measuring frequency (≥ 500 kHz) in Table 3."
