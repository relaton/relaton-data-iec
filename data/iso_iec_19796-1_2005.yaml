abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 19796-1:2005 is a framework to describe, compare, analyse, and
    implement quality management and quality assurance approaches. It will serve to
    compare different existing approaches and to harmonize these towards a common
    quality model. The main aspect is the Reference Framework for the Description
    of Quality Approaches (RFDQ).<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 19796-1:2005 consists of
    the following items:<br />\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tdescription scheme for quality management;\r\n\t\r\n\t\tprocess
    model defining the basic processes to be considered when managing quality in the
    field of ICT-supported learning, education, and training;\r\n\t\r\n\t\tconformance
    statement for the description format.<br /><br />\r\nFor a better understanding
    of ISO/IEC 19796-1:2005, several annexes show samples of its use. The annexes
    are based on the French 'Code of Practice in e-Learning' (AFNOR Z 76-001) and
    German DIN PAS 1032-1. Additionally, an annex on Reference Quality Criteria (RQC)
    is included. These criteria serve as reference criteria for the analysis and evaluation
    of learning resources and scenarios. These criteria are also not a quality assessment
    approach itself, but a framework to compare different quality assurance and quality
    assessment approaches. Additionally, several examples of use are shown, such as
    specific quality objectives (e.g. metadata quality) and guidelines.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19796-1:2005 is only the first step towards a harmonized quality framework; the
    next step is to define quality instruments and metrics in order to provide a complete
    quality approach. It is planned to begin the work on the full quality approach
    as the second part of the QA activity."
