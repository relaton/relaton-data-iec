abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    TR 20943-1:2003 An ISO/IEC 11179-based metadata registry (MDR) (hereafter referred
    to as a \"registry\") is a tool for the management of shareable data; a comprehensive,
    authoritative source of reference information about data. It supports the standardization
    and harmonization processes by recording and disseminating data standards, which
    facilitates data sharing among organizations and users. It provides links to documents
    that refer to data elements and to information systems where data elements are
    used. When used in conjunction with an information database, the registry enables
    users to better understand the information obtained.<br />\r\nA registry does
    not contain data itself. It contains the metadata that is necessary to clearly
    describe, inventory, analyze, and classify data. It provides an understanding
    of the meaning, representation, and identification of units of data. The standard
    identifies the information elements that need to be available for determining
    the meaning of a data element (DE) to be shared between systems.<br />\r\nThe
    purpose of ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003 is to describe a set of procedures for the
    consistent registration of data elements and their attributes in a registry. ISO/IEC
    TR 20943-1:2003 is not a data entry manual, but a user's guide for conceptualizing
    a data element and its associated metadata items for the purpose of consistently
    establishing good quality data elements. An organization may adapt and/or add
    to these procedures as necessary.<br />\r\nThe scope of ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003
    is limited to the associated items of a data element: the data element identifier,
    names and definitions in particular contexts, and examples; data element concept;
    conceptual domain with its value meanings; and value domain with its permissible
    values.<br />\r\nThere is a choice when registering code sets and other value
    domains in an ISO/IEC 11179 metadata registry. Some Registration Authorities treat
    these sets as value domains, and others treat them as data elements. For the purposes
    of ISO/IEC TR 20943-1:2003, the choice will always be to treat the sets as data
    elements unless explicitly stated. This choice is made to help illustrate the
    way to register many different kinds of data elements, including examples for
    registering standard code sets as data elements."
