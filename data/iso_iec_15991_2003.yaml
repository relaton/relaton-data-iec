abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be  downloaded
    \ from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br
    />\r\nISO/IEC 15991:2003 specifies the Supplementary Services Call Priority Interruption
    (SS-CPI) and Call Priority Interruption Protection (SS-CPIP), which are applicable
    to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services Networks (PISN).
    Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nNOTE This edition of ISO/IEC
    15991 does not apply to the circuit-mode Multiple Rate Bearer Service.<br />\r\nSS-CPI
    is a supplementary service that allows a call request for a priority call to proceed
    successfully in the case that there is no user information channel available.
    This is accomplished by force releasing an established call of lower priority.<br
    />\r\nSS-CPIP is a supplementary service that allows for the protection of calls
    against interruption from other, priority, calls.<br />\r\nSS-CPI and SS-CPIP
    are described separately because SS-CPI is a service used by a calling user, and
    SS-CPIP is a service used by either a calling user or a called user.<br />\r\nSupplementary
    service specifications are produced in three stages, according to the method described
    in ETS 300 387. ISO/IEC 15991:2003 contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of SS-CPI. The stage 1 specification (clause 6) specifies the general feature
    principles and capabilities. The stage 2 specification (clause 7) identifies the
    Functional Entities involved in the supplementary service and the information
    flows between them."
