  content: "IEC 60335-2-122:2023 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with the comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC 60335-2-122:2023 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-122:2023 deals with the
    safety of electrically operated commercial washing machines, their rated voltage
    being not more than 250 V for single phase and 480 V for other appliances.<br
    />\r\nThese appliances are not intended for household and similar purpose. They
    are used:<br />\r\n- by experts or instructed persons for commercial washing in
    areas not open to the public, for example on farms and in hotels, hospitals, restaurants
    and canteens; or<br />\r\n- by laymen in areas open to the public, for example
    launderettes and communal laundry rooms.<br />\r\nThe electrical part of appliances
    making use of other forms of energy is also within the scope of this standard.<br
    />\r\nThese appliances are designed to be connected to hot or cold water supply.<br
    />\r\nAppliances making use of steam or hot water for heating purposes are also
    within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by these types of appliances. However,
    in general, it does not consider young children playing with the appliance.<br
    />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that:<br />\r\n- for appliances intended
    to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements
    can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified
    by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the
    protection of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities;<br
    />\r\n- in many countries, additional requirements are specified for appliances
    incorporating pressurized parts;<br />\r\n- for appliances having additional functions
    (e.g. drying function), other standards are also applicable.<br />\r\nThis standard
    does not apply to:<br />\r\n- appliances designed exclusively for industrial purposes
    (ISO 10472-2);<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special
    conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere
    (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- washing machines appliances for household and
    similar use (IEC 60335-2-7).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction
    with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition
    precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used.
    It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
