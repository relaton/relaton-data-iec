    <p>ISO/IEC 24790:2017 specifies device-independent image quality attributes, measurement methods and analytical procedures to describe the quality of output images from hardcopy devices. This document is applicable to human-readable monochrome documents produced from printers and copiers.</p>
    <p>The attributes, methods and procedures rely on measurable properties of printed text and graphic images. Special targets or reference images are not required, but image elements are useful for adequate measurements only if they meet some minimal requirements, e.g. on size or number present. This document is not applicable to images on media other than hardcopy (e.g. images on a visual display) or to images that are intended to be machine readable only (e.g. bar codes).</p>
