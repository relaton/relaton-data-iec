  content: "IEC/IEEE 62582-1:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC/IEEE
    62582-1:2024 contains requirements for application of the other parts of IEC/IEEE
    62582 related to specific methods for condition monitoring in electrical equipment
    important to safety of nuclear power plants. It also includes requirements which
    are common to all methods. The procedures defined in IEC/IEEE 62582 are intended
    for detailed condition monitoring.<br />\r\nIEC/IEEE 62582 specifies condition
    monitoring methods in sufficient detail to enhance the accuracy and repeatability,
    and provide standard formats for reporting the results. The methods specified
    are applicable to electrical equipment containing polymeric materials. Some methods
    are especially designed for the measurement of condition of a limited range of
    equipment whilst others can be applied to all types of equipment for which the
    polymeric parts are accessible."
