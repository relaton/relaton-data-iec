abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    16449 specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics of a 80 mm,
    read-only optical disk to enable the interchange of such disks. It specifies the
    quality of the recorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method,
    thereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. This disk
    is identified as DVD - Read-Only Disk.<br />\r\nISO/IEC 16449 specifies\r\n\r\n\tfour
    related but different Types of this disk,\r\n\tthe conditions for conformance,\r\n\tthe
    environments in which the disk is to be operated and stored,\r\n\tthe mechanical
    and physical characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    between data processing systems,\r\n\tthe format of the information on the disk,
    including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error correcting
    codes and the coding method used,\r\n\tthe characteristics of the signals recorded
    on the disk, enabling data processing systems to read the data from the disk.\r\n\r\nISO/IEC
    16449 provides for interchange of disks between disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems."
