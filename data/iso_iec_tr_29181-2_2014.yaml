abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 29181-2:2014 describes the general characteristics of Future
    Network naming and addressing schemes, including problem statements, requirements,
    design objectives, gap analysis, and development directions.</p><p>Problem Statements:
    The characteristics and problems of existing NAS in existing network will be discussed.</p><p>Technical
    Challenges: A list of major technical challenges to assure that the FN-NAS will
    be able to provide solid</p><p>Requirements: The general characteristics of Future
    Network are discussed and their impact on NAS design.</p><p>Gap analysis: Examines
    the gap between existing network NAS and future network performance expectations.</p><p>FN-NAS
    Standardization Plan, design objectives, gap analysis, development guidance, chronological
    scenarios for future network naming, and addressing guidance are described in
    detail.</p><p>Though ISO/IEC TR 29181-2:2014 mainly presents a list of up-to-date
    surveyed problems, requirements, and plausible techniques for Future Network,
    it does not mean that all of those would be applied to a single Future Network
    in common, since the naming and addressing scheme can be applied to the various
    networks, such as global networks, local networks, access networks, mobile networks,
    etc. If a specific Future Network is designed and implemented, some appropriate
    parts of ISO/IEC TR 29181 would be considered depending on its network usage and
    its characteristics.</p>"
