abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 62246-3:2018(E) provides basic technical background and experience
    about reliability data for reed switch-devices applied to machinery systems as
    well as E/E/PE safety-related control systems during the life cycle phases in
    general and industrial safety applications.<br />\r\nThe document selects typical
    safety applications from group safety standards, and includes national safety
    standards and regulations accordingly. This document shows major reliability aspects
    for a proper design according to the standards, but it does not cover all details
    of an individual design. The responsibility for the verification of system design
    remains with the system integrator/manufacturer."
