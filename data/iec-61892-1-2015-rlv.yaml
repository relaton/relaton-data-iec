  content: "IEC 61892-1:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61892-1:2015 contains
    provisions for electrical installations in mobile and fixed offshore units including
    pipeline, pumping or 'pigging' stations, compressor stations and exposed location
    single buoy moorings, used in the offshore petroleum industry for drilling, processing
    and storage purposes. This International Standard applies to all installations,
    whether permanent, temporary, transportable or hand-held, to AC installations
    up to and including 35 000 V and DC installations up to and including 1 500 V
    (AC and DC voltages are nominal values). This standard does not apply either to
    fixed equipment for medical purposes or to the electrical installations of tankers.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The general requirement to harmonic distortion
    has been changed from IEC 61000-2-4 Class 2 to Class 1.<br />\r\nb) The voltage
    tolerance for a DC system has been changed from +-10 % to +10 %, -15 %.<br />\r\nc)
    Annex C (informative) regarding specification of surface treatment and protective
    painting system has been added."
