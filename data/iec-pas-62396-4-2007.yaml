- language: en
  script: Latn
  content: Provides guidance on atmospheric radiation effects on high voltage, nominally
    above 200 V, avionics electronics used in aircraft operating at altitudes up to
    60 000 feet. Is to be used in conjunction with IEC/TS 62396-1. Defines the effects
    of that environment on high voltage electronics and provides design considerations
    for the accommodation of those effects within avionics systems.
