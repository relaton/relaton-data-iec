abstract:
- content: "IEC 60704-3:2019 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60704-3:2019
    describes procedures for determining and verifying the declared values of the
    noise emitted by household and similar appliances. It applies to all categories
    of household and similar electrical appliances covered by IEC 60704-1 and all
    parts of IEC 60704-2, which include particular requirements for special categories
    of appliances. It applies to appliances being produced in quantity, such as in
    batches, series or lots, which are manufactured to the same technical specification
    and characterized by the same declared value of noise emission. This part of IEC
    60704:<br />\r\n– considers the term \"declaration\" to include all means for
    providing information on the noise emission values to potential users (consumers)
    of the appliances; this includes labels, brochures, advertisements, commercial
    and technical information papers, etc.;<br />\r\n– considers the declaration for
    appliances manufactured by mass production;<br />\r\n– specifies a simple statistical
    method for verifying the declared values by investigating a sample of only three
    appliances.<br />\r\nThis International Standard is to be used in conjunction
    with IEC 60704-1:2010 and the latest edition of IEC 60704-2 (all parts).<br />\r\nThis
    third edition cancels and replaces the second edition published in 2006. This
    edition constitutes a technical revision. It includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) in Annex A,
    standard deviations that are now specified for various appliance categories in
    the parts of IEC 60704-2 have been excluded from Table A.1;<br />\r\nb) furthermore,
    this edition makes reference to new standards and is implementing ISO/IEC Directives,
    Part 2 in a more accurate manner."
