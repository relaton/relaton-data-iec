  content: "IEC TS 62903:2023:<br />\r\na ) establishes the free-field convergent
    spherical wave self-reciprocity method for ultrasonic transducer calibration,<br
    />\r\nb) establishes the measurement conditions and experimental procedure required
    to determine the transducer's electroacoustic parameters and acoustic output power
    using the self-reciprocity method,<br />\r\nc) establishes the criteria for checking
    the reciprocity of these transducers and the linear range of the focused field,
    and<br />\r\nd) provides guiding information for the assessment of the overall
    measurement uncertainties for radiation conductance.<br />\r\nThis document is
    applicable to:<br />\r\n1) circular spherically curved concave focusing transducers
    without a centric hole working in the linear amplitude range,<br />\r\n2) measurements
    in the frequency range 0,5 MHz to 15 MHz, and<br />\r\n3) acoustic pressure amplitudes
    in the focused field within the linear amplitude range.<br />\r\nCharacterization
    and sensitivity calibration of hydrophones using the reciprocity method are not
    addressed in this document but covered in IEC 62127-2 and IEC 60565-1.<br />\r\nIEC
    TS 62903:2023 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2018. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant
    technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) Several quantities
    are recognized as complex-valued quantities in the definitions and in the main
    text.<br />\r\nb) Annex I was added to provide typical measurement ranges and
    to provide example calibration results."
