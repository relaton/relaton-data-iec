  content: "IEC 61196-10-1:2022 applies to coaxial communication cables described
    in IEC 61196-10, which specifies the requirements of semi-rigid coaxial communication
    cables with fluoropolymer dielectric and tubular outer conductors. Semi-rigid
    coaxial communication cables with fluoropolymer dielectric are widely used in
    mobile communication systems, microwave test equipment, radar, aerospace, electronic
    countermeasures and other fields.<br />\r\nThis part of IEC 61196 is used in conjunction
    with IEC 61196-1 and IEC 61196-10, which determines the layout and style for detail
    specifications, based on the blank detail specification, that can be prepared
    by a national organization, a manufacturer, or a user.<br />\r\nThis second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2014. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na. Title was changed to: Blank detail specification for semi-rigid cables
    with fluoropolymer dielectric.<br />\r\nb. Further changes in accordance with
    IEC 61196-10."
