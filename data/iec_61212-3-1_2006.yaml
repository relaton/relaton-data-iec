abstract:
- content: This part of IEC 61212-3 gives requirements for industrial rigid round
    laminated rolled tubes for electrical purposes, based on different resins and
    different reinforcements. Materials which conform to this specification meet established
    levels of performance. However, the selection of a material by a user for a specific
    application should be based on the actual requirements necessary for adequate
    performance in that application and not based on this specification alone.
