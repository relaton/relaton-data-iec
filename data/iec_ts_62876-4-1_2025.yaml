abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62876-4-1:2025, which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    a general reliability testing programme to verify the reliability of the performance
    of quantum dots nanomaterials, and quantum dot enabled light conversion films
    (Q-LCFs).<br />\r\nThe Q-LCF is used as subassemblies for the fabrication of nano-enabled
    photoelectrical display devices, mainly liquid crystal display (LCD) currently,
    with other components.<br />\r\nThis testing programme defines standardized aging
    conditions, methodologies and data assessment for Q-LCF product.<br />\r\nThe
    results of these tests define a stability under standardized aging conditions
    for quantitative evaluation of the reliability of the Q-LCF.<br />\r\nThe procedures
    specified in this document were designed for Q-LCF but can be extended to serve
    as a guideline for other kinds of light conversion films or related subassemblies
    as well."
