abstract:
- content: IEC 62320-1:2007+A1:2008(E) specifies the minimum operational and performance
    requirements, methods of testing and required test results for AIS Base Stations,
    compatible with the performance standards adopted by IMO Resolution MSC.74 (69),
    Annex 3, Universal AIS. Incorporates the technical characteristics of non-shipborne,
    fixed station AIS equipment, included in the relevant ITU and IALA recommendations.
    Where applicable, takes into account the ITU Radio Regulations. This consolidated
    version consists of the first edition (2007) and its amendment 1 (2008). Therefore,
    no need to order amendment in addition to this publication.
