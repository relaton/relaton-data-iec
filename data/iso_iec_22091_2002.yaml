abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 22091:2002 specifies a lossless compression algorithm to reduce
    the number of 8-bit bytes required to represent data records and File Marks. The
    algorithm is known as Streaming Lossless Data Compression algorithm (SLDC).</p><p>ISO/IEC
    22091:2002 is based on ISO/IEC 15220. It extends that algorithm with the addition
    of control symbols that allow records of different sizes and compressibility,
    along with File Marks, to be efficiently encoded into an output stream which requires
    little or no additional control information for later decoding.</p><p>The numerical
    identifier according to ISO/IEC 11576 allocated to this algorithm is 6.</p>"
