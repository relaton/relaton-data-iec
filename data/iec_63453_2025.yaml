abstract:
- content: "IEC 63453:2025 specifies functional requirements for the validation of
    simulation techniques and tools used to assess the dynamic interaction between
    overhead contact lines and pantographs, as part of the prediction of current collection
    quality, to ensure confidence in, and mutual acceptance of the results of the
    simulations.<br />\r\nThis document deals with:<br />\r\n- input and output parameters
    of the simulation;<br />\r\n- comparison with line test measurements, and the
    characteristics of those line tests;<br />\r\n- validation of pantograph models;<br
    />\r\n- comparison between different simulation tools;<br />\r\n- limits of application
    of validated methods to assessments of pantographs and overhead contact lines.<br
    />\r\nThis document applies to the current collection from an overhead contact
    line by pantographs mounted on railway vehicles. It does not apply to trolley
    bus systems."
