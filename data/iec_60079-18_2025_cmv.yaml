abstract:
- content: "IEC 60079-18:2025 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60079-18:2025 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60079-18:2014+AMD1:2017
    CSV edition 4.1. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 31 experts are provided to
    explain the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the
    content.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60079-18:2025 gives the specific requirements for
    the construction, testing and marking of electrical Ex Equipment, parts of electrical
    Ex Equipment and Ex Components with the Type of Protection encapsulation \"m\"
    (hereinafter referred to as \"m\" Equipment) intended for use in explosive gas
    atmospheres or explosive dust atmospheres. For Levels of Protection \"mb\" and
    \"mc\", this document applies where the rated voltage does not exceed 11 kV ACRMS
    or DC. For Level of Protection \"ma\", this document applies where the rated voltage
    does not exceed 1 kV ACRMS or DC. This document does not take account of any hazard
    due to an emission of flammable or toxic gas from the dust. This document supplements
    and modifies the general requirements of IEC 60079-0. Where a requirement of this
    document conflicts with a requirement of IEC 60079-0, the requirement of this
    document takes precedence. This fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth
    edition published in 2014 and Amendment 1:2017. This edition constitutes a technical
    revision. This International Standard is to be used in conjunction with IEC 60079-0,
    Explosive atmospheres - Part 0: Equipment - General requirements. Users of this
    document are advised that interpretation sheets clarifying the interpretation
    of this document can be published. Interpretation sheets are available from the
    IEC webstore and can be found in the \"history\" tab of the page for each document.
    Please see the foreword to this document for the list of significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition."
