abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies rules and code structures associated with the
    data constructs for RFID for item management. In particular, it:</p><p>— defines
    the application family identifier (AFI), including the range of code values that
    are available to use for RFID for item management;</p><p>— defines the data format,
    including the range of code values that are available to use for RFID for item
    management;</p><p>— describes the Object Identifier structure used for RFID for
    item management;</p><p>— specifies the function of the Object Identifier for the
    Unique Item Identifier (UII);</p><p>— specifies the function of the Object Identifier
    for other item attendant data.</p><p>NOTE Conventionally in International Standards,
    long numbers are separated by a space character as a "thousands separator". This
    convention has not been followed in this document because the arcs of an Object
    Identifier are defined by a space separator (according to ISO/IEC 8824 and ISO/IEC
    8825). As the correct representation of these arcs is vital to this document,
    all numeric values have no space separators except to denote a node between two
    arcs of an Object Identifier. For additional clarity, Object Identifiers are presented
    in bold text.</p>
