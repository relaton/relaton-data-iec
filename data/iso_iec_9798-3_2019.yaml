abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies entity authentication mechanisms using digital
    signatures based on asymmetric techniques. A digital signature is used to verify
    the identity of an entity.</p><p>Ten mechanisms are specified in this document.
    The first five mechanisms do not involve an on-line trusted third party and the
    last five make use of on-line trusted third parties. In both of these two categories,
    two mechanisms achieve unilateral authentication and the remaining three achieve
    mutual authentication.</p><p>Annex A defines the object identifiers assigned to
    the entity authentication mechanisms specified in this document.</p>"
