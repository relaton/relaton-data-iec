abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 18630:2023 This document specifies a quality discrimination method
    for optical disks and the operating method of storage systems for long-term digital
    data preservation using optical disks and optical disk drives (hereinafter referred
    to as \"drives\").<br />\r\nIt is applicable to recordable (write-once) optical
    disks which can prevent physical overwriting and deletion by erroneous or intentional
    operation in contexts where greater importance is given to evidence. It is also
    applicable to read-only (ROM) optical disks.<br />\r\nThis document specifies:<br
    />\r\n- combinations of recordable optical disks and drives used for long-term
    data preservation;<br />\r\n- quality discrimination criteria for recordable optical
    disks and the operation method of long-term storage systems;<br />\r\n- a quality
    test for read-only optical disks and the operation method of long-term storage
    systems;<br />\r\n- quality discrimination criteria for BD recordable disks when
    adopting defect management."
