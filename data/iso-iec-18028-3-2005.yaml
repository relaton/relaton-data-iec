    <p>It outlines the techniques for security gateways to analyse network traffic. The techniques discussed are as follows:</p>
    <ul><li>packet filtering,</li><li>stateful packet inspection,</li><li>application proxy,</li><li>network address translation,</li><li>content analysing and filtering.</li></ul>
    <p>Additionally, ISO/IEC 18028-3:2005 provides guidelines for the selection and configuration of security gateways. It gives guidance to choose the right type of architecture for a security gateway, which best meets the security requirements of an organization.</p>
