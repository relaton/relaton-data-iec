abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 29170-2:2015 normalizes evaluation and grading of a light coding
    system used for displays and display systems, but is independent of the display
    technology. This procedure measures whether an observer can distinguish between
    an uncompressed reference and the reconstructed image to a pre-determined, statistically
    meaningful level. The procedure compares individual images with two possible forced
    choice comparison test methods. This procedure relies on subjective evaluation
    methods designed to discern image imperfections on electronic colour displays
    of any technology or size.
