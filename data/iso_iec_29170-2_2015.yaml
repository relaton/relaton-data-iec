abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 29170-2:2015 normalizes
    evaluation and grading of a light coding system used for displays and display
    systems, but is independent of the display technology. This procedure measures
    whether an observer can distinguish between an uncompressed reference and the
    reconstructed image to a pre-determined, statistically meaningful level.</p><p>The
    procedure compares individual images with two possible forced choice comparison
    test methods. This procedure relies on subjective evaluation methods designed
    to discern image imperfections on electronic colour displays of any technology
    or size.</p>
