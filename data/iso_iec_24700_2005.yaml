abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 24700:2004 specifies product characteristics for use in an original
    equipment manufacturer's or authorized third party's declaration of conformity
    to demonstrate that a marketed product that contains reused components performs
    equivalent to new, meeting equivalent to new component specifications and performance
    criteria, and continues to meet all the safety and environmental criteria required
    by responsibly built products. It is relevant to marketed products whose manufacturing
    and recovery processes result in the reuse of components. Annex C has a description
    of how reuse relates to other recycling processes. ISO/IEC 24700:2004 is applicable
    to:A situation in which a government requires a neutral benchmark to evaluate
    the quality, safety and performance of equipment that contains reused components
    and to demonstrate the environmental responsibility of the supplier. When regulations
    mandate a neutral benchmark for equipment, ISO/IEC 24700:2004 provides the benchmark
    for proving compliance with such regulations.A situation in which a commercial
    supplier requires a neutral benchmark to demonstrate and communicate the quality,
    safety and performance of equipment that contains reused components and to demonstrate
    the environmental responsibility of the supplier.Situations in which consumers
    require a neutral benchmark to identify or distinguish environmentally responsible
    products.ISO/IEC 24700:2004 reflects the world's current approaches that yield
    products from many manufacturing processes including the reuse of components,
    with the equipment's warranties and guarantees playing an important role in market
    acceptance. In today's procurement processes, technical equipment definitions
    used by regulators must be addressed and, in that sense, ISO/IEC 24700:2004 will
    be useful in procurement and in the trade facilitation area, to communicate with
    regulators. ISO/IEC 24700:2004 specifically addresses office equipment. However,
    in the future it may provide valuable directions for other industries and industrial
    sectors.
