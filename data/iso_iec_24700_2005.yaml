abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 24700:2004 specifies product characteristics for use in an
    original equipment manufacturer's or authorized third party's declaration of conformity
    to demonstrate that a marketed product that contains reused components performs
    equivalent to new, meeting equivalent to new component specifications and performance
    criteria, and continues to meet all the safety and environmental criteria required
    by responsibly built products. It is relevant to marketed products whose manufacturing
    and recovery processes result in the reuse of components. Annex C has a description
    of how reuse relates to other recycling processes. ISO/IEC 24700:2004 is applicable
    to:</p><ul><li>A situation in which a government requires a neutral benchmark
    to evaluate the quality, safety and performance of equipment that contains reused
    components and to demonstrate the environmental responsibility of the supplier.
    When regulations mandate a neutral benchmark for equipment, ISO/IEC 24700:2004
    provides the benchmark for proving compliance with such regulations.</li><li>A
    situation in which a commercial supplier requires a neutral benchmark to demonstrate
    and communicate the quality, safety and performance of equipment that contains
    reused components and to demonstrate the environmental responsibility of the supplier.</li><li>Situations
    in which consumers require a neutral benchmark to identify or distinguish environmentally
    responsible products.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC 24700:2004 reflects the world's current
    approaches that yield products from many manufacturing processes including the
    reuse of components, with the equipment's warranties and guarantees playing an
    important role in market acceptance. In today's procurement processes, technical
    equipment definitions used by regulators must be addressed and, in that sense,
    ISO/IEC 24700:2004 will be useful in procurement and in the trade facilitation
    area, to communicate with regulators. ISO/IEC 24700:2004 specifically addresses
    office equipment. However, in the future it may provide valuable directions for
    other industries and industrial sectors.</p>"
