abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 15288:2008 establishes a common framework for describing the life
    cycle of systems created by humans. It defines a set of processes and associated
    terminology. These processes can be applied at any level in the hierarchy of a
    system's structure. Selected sets of these processes can be applied throughout
    the life cycle for managing and performing the stages of a system's life cycle.
    This is accomplished through the involvement of all interested parties, with the
    ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15288:2008
    also provides processes that support the definition, control and improvement of
    the life cycle processes used within an organization or a project. Organizations
    and projects can use these life cycle processes when acquiring and supplying systems.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15288:2008 concerns those systems that are man-made and may
    be configured with one or more of the following: hardware, software, data, humans,
    processes (e.g., processes for providing service to users), procedures (e.g.,
    operator instructions), facilities, materials and naturally occurring entities.
    When a system element is software, the software life cycle processes documented
    in ISO/IEC 12207:2008 may be used to implement that system element.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15288:2008 and ISO/IEC 12207:2008 are harmonized for concurrent use on a single
    project or in a single organization."
