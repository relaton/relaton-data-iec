abstract:
- content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14543-4-3:2015(E) specifies the message structure, sequences
    and protocol of the application layer for use in network enhanced control devices
    of the Home Electronic System (HES) Class 1. It provides the services and the
    interface for the user-level process. This application layer protocol is independent
    of lower communications layers, which support MAC addressing or IP addressing.
    The communications sequence is based on the application services.
