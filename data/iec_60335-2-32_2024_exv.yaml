abstract:
- content: "IEC 60335-2-32:2024 EXV contains both the international standard and its
    extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard is
    available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content of
    the Standard. IEC 60335-2-32:2024 EXV includes the content of the references made
    to IEC 60335-1:2020.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-32:2024 deals with the safety
    of electric massage appliances for household and similar purposes, their rated
    voltage being not more than 250 V for single phase appliances and 480 V for other
    appliances including direct current (DC) supplied appliances and battery-operated
    appliances.<br />\r\nExamples of appliances within the scope of this standard
    are<br />\r\n- foot massagers;<br />\r\n- water filled foot massagers;<br />\r\n-
    hand-held massagers;<br />\r\n- massage beds;<br />\r\n- massage belts;<br />\r\n-
    massage chairs;<br />\r\n- massage pads.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for
    normal household use but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as appliances intended to be used by laypersons in shops, in light industry
    and on farms, are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable,
    this standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact
    that<br />\r\n- for appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships
    or aircraft, additional requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries
    additional requirements are specified by the national health authorities, the
    national authorities responsible for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br
    />\r\nThis standard does not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively
    for industrial purposes;<br />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations
    where special conditions prevail, such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive
    atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas);<br />\r\n- electric foot care appliances that
    do not contain motors and other electric appliances for the care of skin or hair
    (IEC 60335-2-23);<br />\r\n- electric appliances for beauty care of persons and
    intended for household, commercial and similar purposes (IEC 60335-2-115).<br
    />\r\nThis sixth edition cancels and replaces the fifth edition published in 2019.
    This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) alignment with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) conversion of some notes
    to normative text (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) application of test probe 19 (8.1.1,
    20.2, B.22.3, B.22.4).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with
    the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes
    it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was
    established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
