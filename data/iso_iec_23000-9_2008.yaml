- content: "ISO/IEC 23000-9:2008 specifies a file format that pertains to both terrestrial
    digital multimedia broadcasting (T-DMB) and satellite digital multimedia broadcasting
    (S-DMB) contents and services. It integrates the existing DMB contents with appropriate
    additional information to facilitate storage, interchange, management, editing,
    and presentation of the contents in protected, governed, and interoperable ways.<br
    /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 23000-9:2008 is applicable both to storage and playback of
    DMB contents and to acquisition and consumption through communication networks
    and removable storages. Application examples of this specification include but
    are not limited to<br /><br />\r\nscheduled storage and time-shifted playback
    of DMB contents,<br />\r\nfile casting through DMB data channel,<br />\r\nIP media
    service such as DMB content portal,<br />\r\nrightful interchange of DMB contents
    between terminals, and<br />\r\nuser editing or creation from DMB contents."
