    <p>ISO/IEC 23004-6:2008 specifies the interfaces of the support application programming interface (API) and the realization technology used for Fault Management in MPEG Multimedia Middleware (M3W). Fault Management is an optional framework for M3W Platforms. The goal is to have a dependable/reliable system in the context of faults. These faults can be introduced due to upgrades and extensions out of control of the device vendor. The faults can also exist because it is impossible to test all traces and configurations in the complex software systems we are building nowadays. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 23004-6:2008 specifies </p>
    <ul>
    <li>an approach of adding fault tolerance mechanism through the use of a Middleman (wrapper), </li>
    <li>an approach for transparent instantation of these Middlemans (wrappers), </li>
    <li>interfaces for coordination of fault handling between Middlemans (wrappers).</li>
    </ul>
