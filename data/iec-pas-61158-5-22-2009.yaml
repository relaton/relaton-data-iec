  content: IEC/PAS 61158-5-22:2009(E) provides user programs with a means to access
    the fieldbus communication environment. In this respect, the FAL can be viewed
    as a "window between corresponding application programs." It provides common elements
    for basic time-critical and non-time-critical messaging communications between
    application programs in an automation environment and material specific to Type
    SNpTYPE fieldbus. It contains an additional profile - SNpTYPE - which may be integrated
    into a future new edition of the IEC 61158-5 series.
