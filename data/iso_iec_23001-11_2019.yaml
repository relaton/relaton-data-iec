abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 23001-11:2019 This document specifies metadata for energy-efficient
    decoding, encoding, presentation and selection of media.<br />\r\nThe metadata
    for energy-efficient decoding specifies two sets of information: complexity metrics
    (CM) metadata and decoding operation reduction request (DOR-Req) metadata. A decoder
    uses CM metadata to vary operating frequency and thus reduce decoder power consumption.
    In a point-to-point video conferencing application, the remote encoder uses the
    DOR-Req metadata to modify the decoding complexity of the bitstream and thus reduce
    local decoder power consumption.<br />\r\nThe metadata for energy-efficient encoding
    specifies a quality metric that is used by a decoder to reduce the quality loss
    from low-power encoding.<br />\r\nThe metadata for energy-efficient presentation
    specifies RGB-component statistics and quality levels. A presentation subsystem
    uses this metadata to reduce power by adjusting display parameters, based on the
    statistics, to provide a desired quality level from those provided in the metadata.<br
    />\r\nThe metadata for energy-efficient media selection specifies decoder operation
    reduction ratios (DOR-Ratios), RGB-component statistics and quality levels. The
    client in an adaptive streaming session uses this metadata to determine decoder
    and display power-saving characteristics of available video representations and
    to select the representation with the optimal quality for a given power-saving."
