abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies a uniform representation of human sexes for
    the interchange of information. It is intended to:</p><p>— reduce the time required
    to record and/or format the representation of sexes and transmit the corresponding
    data;</p><p>— improve clarity and accuracy of interchange;</p><p>— minimize the
    amount of human intervention required for communicating the representation of
    sexes; and</p><p>— reduce costs.</p><p>This document does not prescribe file sequences,
    storage media, programming languages, or other features of information processing
    to be used in its implementation.</p><p>This document meets the requirements of
    most applications that need to code human sexes. It does not provide codes for
    sexes that can be required in specific medical and scientific applications or
    in applications that need to code sex information other than for human beings.
    It also does not provide codes for human gender identities that can be required
    in other applications.</p><p>This document does not supplant national standards
    for coding sexes that are designed based upon codes derived from names of sexes
    in the various languages (for example “M” for “male” and “F” for “female” in the
    English language). It provides a numeric code that is independent of language-derived
    codes and as such is intended to provide a common basis for the international
    exchange of information containing human sex data elements.</p>"
