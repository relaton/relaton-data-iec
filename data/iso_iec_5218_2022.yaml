abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 5218:2022 This document specifies a uniform representation of
    human sexes for the interchange of information. It is intended to:<br />\r\n-
    reduce the time required to record and/or format the representation of sexes and
    transmit the corresponding data;<br />\r\n- improve clarity and accuracy of interchange;<br
    />\r\n- minimize the amount of human intervention required for communicating the
    representation of sexes; and<br />\r\n- reduce costs.<br />\r\nThis document does
    not prescribe file sequences, storage media, programming languages, or other features
    of information processing to be used in its implementation.<br />\r\nThis document
    meets the requirements of most applications that need to code human sexes. It
    does not provide codes for sexes that can be required in specific medical and
    scientific applications or in applications that need to code sex information other
    than for human beings. It also does not provide codes for human gender identities
    that can be required in other applications.<br />\r\nThis document does not supplant
    national standards for coding sexes that are designed based upon codes derived
    from names of sexes in the various languages (for example “M” for “male” and “F”
    for “female” in the English language). It provides a numeric code that is independent
    of language-derived codes and as such is intended to provide a common basis for
    the international exchange of information containing human sex data elements."
