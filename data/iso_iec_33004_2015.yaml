abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 33004:2015 sets out the
    requirements for process reference models, process assessment models, and maturity
    models. The requirements defined in this International Standard form a structure
    which specifies</p><p>a) the relationship between the classes of process model
    associated with the performance of process assessment,</p><p>b) the relationship
    between process reference models and prescriptive/normative models of process
    performance, as constituted by, for example, the activities and tasks defined
    in ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288,</p><p>c) the integration of process reference
    models and process measurement frameworks to establish process assessment models,</p><p>d)
    the use of common sets of assessment indicators of process performance and process
    quality in process assessment models, and</p><p>e) the relationship between maturity
    models and process assessment models and the extent to which a maturity model
    can be constructed using elements from different process assessment models.</p>
