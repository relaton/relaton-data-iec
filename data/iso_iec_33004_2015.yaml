abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 33004:2015 sets out the requirements for process reference
    models, process assessment models, and maturity models. The requirements defined
    in this International Standard form a structure which specifies</p><p>a) the relationship
    between the classes of process model associated with the performance of process
    assessment,</p><p>b) the relationship between process reference models and prescriptive/normative
    models of process performance, as constituted by, for example, the activities
    and tasks defined in ISO/IEC 12207 and ISO/IEC 15288,</p><p>c) the integration
    of process reference models and process measurement frameworks to establish process
    assessment models,</p><p>d) the use of common sets of assessment indicators of
    process performance and process quality in process assessment models, and</p><p>e)
    the relationship between maturity models and process assessment models and the
    extent to which a maturity model can be constructed using elements from different
    process assessment models.</p>"
