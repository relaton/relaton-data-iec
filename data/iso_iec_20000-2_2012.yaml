abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012 provides guidance on the application of service management
    systems (SMS) based on the requirements in ISO/IEC 20000-1.   ISO/IEC 20000-2:2012
    enables organizations and individuals to interpret ISO/IEC 20000-1 more accurately,
    and therefore to use it more effectively. The guidance includes examples and suggestions
    to enable organizations to interpret and apply ISO/IEC 20000-1, including references
    to other parts of ISO/IEC 20000 and other relevant standards.   This includes
    guidance on the use of an SMS for the planning, design, transition, delivery and
    improvement of the SMS and services. At a minimum this includes service management
    policies, objectives, plans, service management processes, process interfaces,
    documentation and resources. The SMS provides ongoing control, greater effectiveness,
    efficiency and opportunities for continual improvement of service management and
    of services. It enables an organization to work effectively with a shared vision.
