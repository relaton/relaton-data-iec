    <p>ISO/IEC 26557:2016, within the context of tools and methods of variability mechanisms for software and system product lines<b>:</b></p>
    <p>-      provides the terms and definitions related to variability mechanisms for software and systems product lines;</p>
    <p>-      defines processes and their subprocesses for operating variability mechanisms at each product line life cycle stages and those for providing managerial supports. Those processes are described in terms of purpose, inputs, tasks and outcomes;</p>
    <p>-      defines method capabilities to support the defined tasks of each process;</p>
    <p>-      defines tool capabilities to automate/semi-automate tasks or defined method capabilities.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 26557:2016 does not concern processes and capabilities of tools and methods for a single system, but rather deals with those for a family of products.</p>
