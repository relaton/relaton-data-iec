  content: "IEC TS 62344:2022 applies to the design of earth electrode stations for
    high-voltage direct current (HVDC) links. It is intended to provide necessary
    guidelines, limits, and precautions to be followed during the design of earth
    electrodes to ensure safety of personnel and earth electrodes, and reduce any
    significant impacts on DC power transmission systems and the surrounding environment.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- Changed the requirement of earthing resistance
    limit for short-time unipolar earth system in 5.1.3.<br />\r\n- Corrected the
    coefficient before ρs from 0,015 9 to 0,008 in touch voltage limit calculation
    formula (3) in 5.1.5.<br />\r\n- Deleted the analytical calculation formulas of
    earthing resistance for sea and shore electrodes in 6.1.3.<br />\r\n- Changed
    the current density limit from 100 A/m2 to 40 A/m2 ~ 50 A/m2 for the sea electrodes
    that are not accessible to human beings or to marine fauna in 6.1.7.<br />\r\n-
    Extended some detailed technical requirements for the measurement of ground/water
    soil parameters in 6.2.5.<br />\r\n- Reformulated the types and characteristics
    of electrode element material for sea and shore electrodes in 6.3.2.<br />\r\n-
    Added an informative Annex B: Earth electrode design process.<br />\r\n- Added
    an informative Annex C: Test results of human body resistance.<br />\r\n- Deleted
    the formula for calculating the average soil resistivity using harmonic mean when
    processing the measurement data in D.2.6 of Annex D.<br />\r\n- Extended some
    detailed technical requirements of electrode online monitoring system in Annex
    H.<br />\r\n- CIGRE 675:2017 is added to the bibliography.<br />\r\n- Terminology
    and way of expressions are modified using more commonly used terms in the HVDC
    electrode design industries and English-speaking countries, so as to make the
    readers understand the content more easily."
