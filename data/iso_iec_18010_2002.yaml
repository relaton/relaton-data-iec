abstract:
- content: "Specifies the structure and requirements for pathways and spaces\nwithin
    or between buildings for information exchange and telecommunications cabling\naccording
    to ISO/IEC 11801 and ISO/IEC 15018.\nBoth single- and\nmulti-tenant buildings
    are considered; \nsafety aspects of the building design, fire stopping measures
    or\ntelecommunications systems that require any special types of security measures
    are not covered.\n\nThe telecommunications infrastructure is an integral part
    of building design. It may include\nvoice, data, environmental control, security,
    audio, television, sensing, alarms, paging and\nother low voltage and power limited
    signal systems. These systems are subject to frequent\nchanges. Design of the
    pathways and spaces should accommodate this dynamic behaviour.\nThis Standard
    significantly influences the design of other building services, such as electrical\npower
    and heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC).\nGenerally it makes no specific
    recommendations among the design options\navailable for telecommunications pathways
    and spaces."
