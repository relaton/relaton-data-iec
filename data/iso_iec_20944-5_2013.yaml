abstract:
- content: "<p>The ISO/IEC 20944 series of International Standards provides the bindings
    and their interoperability for metadata registries, such as those specified in
    the ISO/IEC 11179 series of International Standards. ISO/IEC 20944-5:2013 contains
    provisions that are common to the profiles, and the profiles themselves. A profile
    of ISO/IEC 11179-3:2003 is included, which maps ISO/IEC 11179 metadata attributes
    to standardized identifiers for navigation and access of ISO/IEC 11179 metadata.</p>"
