  content: "ISO 15118-5:2018 specifies conformance tests in the form of an Abstract
    Test Suite (ATS) for a System Under Test (SUT) implementing an Electric Vehicle
    or Supply Equipment Communication Controller (EVCC or SECC) with support for PLC-based
    High Level Communication (HLC) and Basic Signaling according to ISO 15118‑3. These
    conformance tests specify the testing of capabilities and behaviors of an SUT,
    as well as checking what is observed against the conformance requirements specified
    in ISO 15118‑3 and against what the implementer states the SUT implementation's
    capabilities are.<br />\r\nThe capability tests within the ATS check that the
    observable capabilities of the SUT are in accordance with the static conformance
    requirements defined in ISO 15118‑3. The behavior tests of the ATS examine an
    implementation as thoroughly as is practical over the full range of dynamic conformance
    requirements defined in ISO 15118‑3 and within the capabilities of the SUT (see
    NOTE 1).<br />\r\nA test architecture is described in correspondence to the ATS.
    The conformance test cases in this part of the standard are described leveraging
    this test architecture and are specified in TTCN-3 Core Language for the ISO/OSI
    Physical and Data Link Layers (Layers 1 and 2). The conformance test cases for
    the ISO/OSI Network Layer (Layer 3) and above are described in ISO 15118‑4.<br
    />\r\nIn terms of coverage, this document only covers normative sections and requirements
    in ISO 15118‑3. This document can additionally include specific tests for requirements
    of referenced standards (e.g. IEEE, or industry consortia standards) as long as
    they are relevant in terms of conformance for implementations according to ISO
    15118‑3. However, it is explicitly not intended to widen the scope of this conformance
    specification to such external standards, if it is not technically necessary for
    the purpose of conformance testing for ISO 15118‑3. Furthermore, the conformance
    tests specified in this document do not include the assessment of performance
    nor robustness or reliability of an implementation. They cannot provide judgments
    on the physical realization of abstract service primitives, how a system is implemented,
    how it provides any requested service, nor the environment of the protocol implementation.
    Furthermore, the test cases defined in this document only consider the communication
    protocol and the system's behavior defined ISO 15118‑3. Power flow between the
    EVSE and the EV is not considered.<br />\r\nNOTE 1 Practical limitations make
    it impossible to define an exhaustive test suite, and economic considerations
    can restrict testing even further. Hence, the purpose of this document is to increase
    the probability that different implementations are able to interwork. This is
    achieved by verifying them by means of a protocol test suite, thereby increasing
    the confidence that each implementation conforms to the protocol specification.
    However, the specified protocol test suite cannot guarantee conformance to the
    specification since it detects errors rather than their absence. Thus conformance
    to a test suite alone cannot guarantee interworking. What it does do is give confidence
    that an implementation has the required capabilities and that its behavior conforms
    consistently in representative instances of communication.<br />\r\nNOTE 2 This
    document has some interdependencies to the conformance tests defined in ISO 15118‑4
    which result from ISO/OSI cross layer dependencies in the underlying protocol
    specification (e.g. for sleep mode)."
