abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 describes the requirements for Directory management
    and analyses these requirements to identify those that may be realized by OSI
    Systems Management services (and protocols), those that are realized by Directory
    services (and protocols), and those that are realized by local means.</p><p>Based
    on the requirements, this Directory Specification defines a model for Directory
    management that encompasses all of the requirements.</p><p>Management of the Directory
    is divided into four major segments:</p><ul><li>management of the DIT Domain:
    Management of Directory information;</li><li>management of the operation of a
    single DSA within a DMD;</li><li>management of the operation of a single DUA within
    a DMD; and</li><li>management of the Directory Management Domain (DMD): Integrated
    management of the functional components of the Directory.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    9594-10:2008 covers the first three items listed above; management of the Directory
    Management Domain is for further study.</p><p>Based on the model, ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008
    describes the detailed OSI Systems Management Managed Objects used to manage Directory
    System Agents (DSAs) and Directory User Agents (DUAs) within a Directory Domain
    and describes the detailed OSI Systems Management Managed Objects used to manage
    the interfaces to DUAs and DSAs in other domains.</p>"
