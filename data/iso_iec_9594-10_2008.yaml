abstract:
- content: 'ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 describes the requirements for Directory management
    and analyses these requirements to identify those that may be realized by OSI
    Systems Management services (and protocols), those that are realized by Directory
    services (and protocols), and those that are realized by local means.Based on
    the requirements, this Directory Specification defines a model for Directory management
    that encompasses all of the requirements.Management of the Directory is divided
    into four major segments:management of the DIT Domain: Management of Directory
    information;management of the operation of a single DSA within a DMD;management
    of the operation of a single DUA within a DMD; andmanagement of the Directory
    Management Domain (DMD): Integrated management of the functional components of
    the Directory.ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 covers the first three items listed above;
    management of the Directory Management Domain is for further study.Based on the
    model, ISO/IEC 9594-10:2008 describes the detailed OSI Systems Management Managed
    Objects used to manage Directory System Agents (DSAs) and Directory User Agents
    (DUAs) within a Directory Domain and describes the detailed OSI Systems Management
    Managed Objects used to manage the interfaces to DUAs and DSAs in other domains.'
