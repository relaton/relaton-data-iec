abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">The purpose of this document is to provide a method
    to determine the ink cartridge yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated
    ink cartridges and ink cartridges without integrated print heads) for colour photo
    printing with colour inkjet printers and multifunction devices that contain inkjet
    printer components. In the case where a cartridge set can be used in multiple
    printer models, only one yield test is performed as long as the difference between
    printer models does not impact yield.</p><p class="Note">NOTE A cartridge supplier
    can choose to use more than one market identifier for a single physical cartridge.
    In this case only one yield test is required as long as there are no differences
    in the cartridges other than market identifiers.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document prescribes the following:</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->the test method that
    manufacturers, test laboratories, etc. use to determine ink cartridge yield;</p><p
    class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->the
    method for determination of declared cartridge yield values for photo printing
    from the test results; and</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list: l0 level1
    lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->the appropriate method of describing
    the cartridge yield for photo printing in documentation supplied to the consumer
    by the manufacturer.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This document is only intended
    for the determination of ink cartridge yield. No other claims can be made from
    this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document can be used to determine the yield of any cartridge that is used during
    the printing of the photo test file defined in ISO/IEC 29103.</p><p class="MsoBodyText">This
    document is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to
    or greater than A3. This document is not intended to measure the yield of photo
    printing on paper size larger than 4" × 6", L or A6. In addition, this document
    is not for use with industrial printers or point of sale printers. It only applies
    to desktop printing systems.</p>'
