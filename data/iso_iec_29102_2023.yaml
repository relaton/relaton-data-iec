abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29102:2023 The purpose of this document is to provide a method
    to determine the ink cartridge yield of ink-containing cartridges (i.e. integrated
    ink cartridges and ink cartridges without integrated print heads) for colour photo
    printing with colour inkjet printers and multifunction devices that contain inkjet
    printer components. In the case where a cartridge set can be used in multiple
    printer models, only one yield test is performed as long as the difference between
    printer models does not impact yield.<br />\r\nNOTE A cartridge supplier can choose
    to use more than one market identifier for a single physical cartridge. In this
    case only one yield test is required as long as there are no differences in the
    cartridges other than market identifiers.<br />\r\nThis document prescribes the
    following:<br />\r\n- the test method that manufacturers, test laboratories, etc.
    use to determine ink cartridge yield;<br />\r\n- the method for determination
    of declared cartridge yield values for photo printing from the test results; and<br
    />\r\n- the appropriate method of describing the cartridge yield for photo printing
    in documentation supplied to the consumer by the manufacturer.<br />\r\nThis document
    is only intended for the determination of ink cartridge yield. No other claims
    can be made from this testing regarding quality, reliability, etc.<br />\r\nThis
    document can be used to determine the yield of any cartridge that is used during
    the printing of the photo test file defined in ISO/IEC 29103.<br />\r\nThis document
    is not for use with printers whose minimum printable size is equal to or greater
    than A3. This document is not intended to measure the yield of photo printing
    on paper size larger than 4\" Ã— 6\", L or A6. In addition, this document is not
    for use with industrial printers or point of sale printers. It only applies to
    desktop printing systems."
