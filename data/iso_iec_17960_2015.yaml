abstract:
- content: "ISO 32000-1:2008 This International Standard specifies a language-neutral
    and environment-neutral description to define the methodology needed to support
    the signing of software source code, to enable it to be uniquely identified, and
    to enable roll-back to signed previous versions. It is intended to be used by
    originators of software source code and the recipients of their signed source
    code. This International Standard is designed for transfers of source code among
    disparate entities.<br />\r\nThe following areas are outside the scope of this
    International Standard:<br />\r\n- Determination of the trust level of a certification
    authority;<br />\r\n- Format used to track revisions of source code files;<br
    />\r\n- Digital signing of object or binary code;<br />\r\n- System configuration
    and resource availability;<br />\r\n- Metadata<br />\r\n    - This is partially
    addressed by ISO/IEC 19770â€‘2;<br />\r\n- Transmission and representation issues<br
    />\r\n    - Though this could be an issue in implementation, there are techniques
    such as Portable Document Format (PDF)[1] that can be used to mitigate these issues.
    This applies in particular to the transmission of digital signatures.<br />\r\n[1]
    ISO 32000-1:2008 Document management - Portable document format - Part 1: PDF
    1 specifies a digital form for representing electronic documents to enable users
    to exchange and view electronic documents independent of the environment in which
    they were created or the environment in which they are viewed or printed."
