abstract:
- content: 'CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>This International Standard specifies
    a language-neutral and environment-neutral description to define the methodology
    needed to support the signing of software source code, to enable it to be uniquely
    identified, and to enable roll-back to signed previous versions. It is intended
    to be used by originators of software source code and the recipients of their
    signed source code. This International Standard is designed for transfers of source
    code among disparate entities.</p><p>The following areas are outside the scope
    of this International Standard:</p><p>- Determination of the trust level of a
    certification authority;</p><p>- Format used to track revisions of source code
    files;</p><p>- Digital signing of object or binary code;</p><p>- System configuration
    and resource availability;</p><p>- Metadata</p><ul><li>- This is partially addressed
    by ISO/IEC 19770‑2;</li></ul><p>- Transmission and representation issues</p><ul><li>-
    Though this could be an issue in implementation, there are techniques such as
    Portable Document Format (PDF)[1] that can be used to mitigate these issues. This
    applies in particular to the transmission of digital signatures.</li></ul><p>[1]
    ISO 32000-1:2008 Document management? Portable document format? Part 1: PDF 1
    specifies a digital form for representing electronic documents to enable users
    to exchange and view electronic documents independent of the environment in which
    they were created or the environment in which they are viewed or printed.</p>'
