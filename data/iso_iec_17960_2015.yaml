abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies a language-neutral and environment-neutral
    description to define the methodology needed to support the signing of software
    source code, to enable it to be uniquely identified, and to enable roll-back to
    signed previous versions. It is intended to be used by originators of software
    source code and the recipients of their signed source code. This International
    Standard is designed for transfers of source code among disparate entities.</p><p>The
    following areas are outside the scope of this International Standard:</p><p>-
    Determination of the trust level of a certification authority;</p><p>- Format
    used to track revisions of source code files;</p><p>- Digital signing of object
    or binary code;</p><p>- System configuration and resource availability;</p><p>-
    Metadata</p><ul><li>- This is partially addressed by ISO/IEC 19770â€‘2;</li></ul><p>-
    Transmission and representation issues</p><ul><li>- Though this could be an issue
    in implementation, there are techniques such as Portable Document Format (PDF)[1]
    that can be used to mitigate these issues. This applies in particular to the transmission
    of digital signatures.</li></ul><p>[1] ISO 32000-1:2008 Document management? Portable
    document format? Part 1: PDF 1 specifies a digital form for representing electronic
    documents to enable users to exchange and view electronic documents independent
    of the environment in which they were created or the environment in which they
    are viewed or printed.</p>"
