    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8882 defines an abstract test suite for testing the conformance of the Data Link Layer of an IUT with</p>
    <p>respect to ISO/IEC 7776 (1986, 1995) or the ITU-T Recommendation X.25 (1980, 1984, 1988, 1993).</p>
    <p>Conformance of a Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) to the above ISO International Standard or ITU-T Recommendations is</p>
    <p>tested using a dedicated circuit between the tester and the DTE. It is noted that ITU-T Recommendations X.25 (1980), X.25</p>
    <p>(1984), X.25 (1988) and X.25 (1993) are written from the perspective of a DCE and therefore do not always explicitly specify the</p>
    <p>DTE's operation. In such cases it is assumed that recommended operation of a DTE is included by implication because of the</p>
    <p>need to communicate with X.25 DCE's. This part of ISO/IEC 8882 excludes the testing of the LAP procedures given in the ITU-T</p>
    <p>Recommendations.</p>
    <p>NOTE Test cases for extended mode operation (Modulo 128), multilink procedure and DTE-DTE operation as per ISO/IEC 7776 are for</p>
    <p>further study.</p>
    <p>The tests in this part of ISO/IEC 8882 are designed for six possible interworking situations, shown in Figure 1. This part</p>
    <p>specifies tests for all six cases shown in Figure 1, but recognizes that not every test may apply to a particular DTE. A test</p>
    <p>selection procedure has to be performed to determine the applicability of a test to a particular DTE. Such selection will be based</p>
    <p>on the PICS and the PIXIT.</p>
    <p/>
    <p><b>Figure 1 — Testing X.25-DTE/DCE and X.25-DTE/DTE Interworking</b></p>
    <p>In the rest of this part of ISO/IEC 8882, the term "X.25 standards" means all four of ITU-T Recommendations X.25 (1980), X.25</p>
    <p>(1984), X.25 (1988), X.25 (1993), and International Standards ISO/IEC 7776 (1995) and ISO/IEC 7776 (1986), unless stated</p>
    <p>otherwise.</p>
