    <p>The CDIF family of standards is primarily designed to be used as a description of a mechanism for transferring</p>
    <p>information between modelling tools. It facilitates a successful transfer when the authors of the importing and</p>
    <p>exporting tools have nothing in common except an agreement to conform to CDIF. The language that is defined for</p>
    <p>the transfer format also has applicability as a general language for import/export from repositories. The CDIF</p>
    <p>semantic metamodel defined for CASE also has applicability as the basis of standard definitions for use in</p>
    <p>repositories.</p>
    <p>The standards which form the complete family of CDIF standards are documented in ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002,</p>
    <p><i>Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 1: Overview. </i>These standards cover the overall framework, the</p>
    <p>transfer format and the CDIF semantic metamodel.</p>

    <p/>
    <p><b>Figure 1 </b>− <b>CDIF family of standards</b></p>
    <p>The diagram in Figure 1 depicts the various standards that comprise the CDIF family of standards. The shaded box</p>
    <p>depicts this Standard and its position in the CDIF family of standards.</p>
    <p>This standard defines the Common Subject Area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. This subject area contains</p>
    <p>meta-objects that are used as the basis of the other subject area standards, and also meta-relationships and metaattributes</p>
    <p>that are applicable to all meta-objects.</p>
    <p>This document is intended to be used by anyone wishing to understand and/or use CDIF. This document provides</p>
    <p>a definition of a single subject area of the CDIF semantic metamodel. It is suitable for:</p>
    <p> Those evaluating CDIF,</p>
    <p> Those who wish to understand the principles and concepts of a CDIF transfer, and</p>
    <p> Those developing importers and exporters.</p>
    <p>This document, ISO/IEC 15474-1:2002<i>, Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 1: Overview</i>, and the</p>
    <p>Framework document ISO/IEC 15474-2:2002<i>, Information technology — CDIF framework — Part 2: Modelling and</i></p>
    <p><i>extensibility</i>, should be read first when initially exploring CDIF and before attempting to read other documents in the</p>
    <p>CDIF family of standards.</p>
    <p>While there are no specific prerequisites for reading this document, it will be helpful for the reader to have familiarity</p>
    <p>with the following:</p>
    <p> Entity-Relationship-Attribute modelling;</p>
    <p> Modelling (CASE) tools;</p>
    <p> Information repositories;</p>
    <p> Data dictionaries;</p>
    <p> Multiple meta-layer modelling.</p>
