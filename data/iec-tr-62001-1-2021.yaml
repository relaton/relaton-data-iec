  content: "IEC TR 62001-1:2021 deals with the specification and design evaluation
    of AC side harmonic performance and AC side filters for HVDC schemes. It is intended
    to be primarily for the use of the utilities and consultants who are responsible
    for issuing the specifications for new HVDC projects and evaluating designs proposed
    by prospective suppliers. This document provides guidance on the specifications
    of AC filters for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) systems with line-commutated
    converters and filter performance calculation. The scope of this document covers
    AC side filtering for the frequency range of interest in terms of harmonic distortion
    and audible frequency disturbances. Where the term \"HVDC converter\" or \"HVDC
    station\" is referred to without qualification, in this document, it is understood
    to refer to LCC technology. It excludes filters designed to be effective in the
    power line carrier (PLC) and radio interference spectra. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\n- general updating of the document to reflect changes in practice;<br />\r\n-
    10.2.4 on fuseless capacitors has been transferred to IEC TR 62001-4;<br />\r\n-
    Clause 11 on future developments has been expanded;<br />\r\n- 10.3.3 and Annex
    F on voltage sourced converters have been deleted as their content is covered
    by IEC TR 62543."
