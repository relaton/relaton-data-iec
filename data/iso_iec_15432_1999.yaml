abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the Authentication supplementary services, which
    are applicable to various basic services supported by Private Integrated Services
    Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.<br />\r\nAuthentication
    of a WTM user (SS-WTAT) is a supplementary service that enables a PISN, as a security
    measure, to validate the identity provided by the WTM user.<br />\r\nAuthentication
    of the PISN (SS-WTAN) is a supplementary service that enables a served WTM user,
    as a security measure, to validate the identity of the PISN.<br />\r\nThe mechanisms
    used in these supplementary services are based on the challenge and response method
    of authentication. Authentication algorithms to be used by these two supplementary
    services (SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN) are outside the scope of this International Standard.
    This International Standard provides the information flows to convey the security
    parameters.<br />\r\nSupplementary service specifications are produced in three
    stages, according to the method described in CCITT Recommendation I.130. This
    International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications of SS-WTAT
    and SS-WTAN. The stage 1 specification (clause 6 and 7) specifies the supplementary
    service as seen by users of PISNs.<br />\r\nThe stage 2 specification (clause
    8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary service
    and the information flows between them."
