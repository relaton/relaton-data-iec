abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the Authentication supplementary
    services, which are applicable to various basic</p><p>services supported by Private
    Integrated Services Networks (PISN). Basic services are specified in ISO/IEC 11574.</p><p>Authentication
    of a WTM user (SS-WTAT) is a supplementary service that enables a PISN, as a security
    measure, to</p><p>validate the identity provided by the WTM user.</p><p>Authentication
    of the PISN (SS-WTAN) is a supplementary service that enables a served WTM user,
    as a security</p><p>measure, to validate the identity of the PISN.</p><p>The mechanisms
    used in these supplementary services are based on the challenge and response method
    of</p><p>authentication. Authentication algorithms to be used by these two supplementary
    services (SS-WTAT and SS-WTAN)</p><p>are outside the scope of this International
    Standard. This International Standard provides the information flows to</p><p>convey
    the security parameters.</p><p>Supplementary service specifications are produced
    in three stages, according to the method described in CCITT</p><p>Recommendation
    I.130. This International Standard contains the stage 1 and stage 2 specifications
    of SS-WTAT and</p><p>SS-WTAN. The stage 1 specification (clause 6 and 7) specifies
    the supplementary service as seen by users of PISNs.</p><p>The stage 2 specification
    (clause 8 and 9) identifies the functional entities involved in the supplementary
    service and the</p><p>information flows between them.</p>"
