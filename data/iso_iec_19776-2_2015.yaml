abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    19775-2:2015, Extensible 3D (X3D), defines a system that integrates 3D graphics
    and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D file is a 3D time-based space that contains
    graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of
    mechanisms. This part of ISO/IEC 19776 defines a mapping of the abstract objects
    in X3D to a specific encoding using the technique defined in ISO/IEC 14772 - Virtual
    reality modeling language (VRML).<br />\r\nEach Classic VRML-encoded X3D file:<p>a.
    supports all of the purposes of X3D files defined in ISO/IEC 19775; and<br />\r\nb.
    encodes X3D constructs in Classic VRML format.</p><p>A Classic VRML-encoded X3D
    file may be referenced from files using other encodings and may itself reference
    X3D files encoded using other encodings. Such files can only be processed by browsers
    which conform to all of the utilized encodings.</p>"
