abstract:
- content: "This Technical Report is intended as an aid for understanding the libraries
    specified in Standard ECMA-335, Partition IV: Profiles and Libraries. That Partition
    includes a machine-readable specification, in XML, of the types that comprise
    the standard libraries. This Technical Report, in companion files, provides the
    following items which help to form a traceable chain from the normative XML specification
    to a portable, printable representation of its contents:<br />\r\nTool Source
    Code: A program written in the C# programming language, XML Style-sheet Language
    (XSL), and using the facilities of the Microsoft.NET Framework(TM) and Microsoft
    Office(TM) to convert the XML into files viewable using Microsoft Word(TM). This
    program, provided by Intel Corporation, can be modified to produce other views
    of the XML.<br />\r\nMicrosoft Word(TM) Files: These are the files produced by
    running the tool mentioned above on the XML from Partition IV. The Ecma task group
    TC39/TG3 used similar files (produced using earlier versions of this tool run
    against earlier versions of the XML) as the primary means of reviewing the XML.<br
    />\r\nPDF(TM) Files: These files are produced from the Microsoft Word(TM) files
    using the Adobe Acrobat(TM) program. They are viewable on a wide range of computer
    systems and printable on a range of computer output devices. In most cases, they
    will appear visually identical regardless of the means used to render them."
