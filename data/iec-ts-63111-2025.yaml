  content: "<p>IEC TS 63111:2025 describes hydraulic transient phenomena of hydro
    turbines, storage pumps and pump-turbines and the factors that affect them, (2)
    provides modelling and measurement best practice guidelines and resulting limitations
    (3) defines relevant equipment design criteria, and (4) identifies potential mitigation
    solutions. Definitions of the relevant terms and quantities are provided along
    with descriptions of the system components that are considered. In this Technical
    Specification, abnormal transient phenomena are also defined and described, including
    component malfunction and catastrophic events like component rupture. The probability
    of the occurrence of these extreme events and how this can influence the relevant
    safety margin is described. This Technical Specification provides guidelines and
    commonly accepted practices to model and compute transient conditions. It provides
    a summary of the basic hypotheses and equations, together with relevant characteristic
    quantities and system time constants. Accepted methods of modelling hydraulic
    components, and related numerical simulation methods are identified. This specification
    details the input data, including best practices for model testing of hydraulic
    machines, valves, gates, etc. to acquire reliable transient modelling. This Technical
    Specification describes methodologies for on-site measurements with respect to
    transient such as load rejection tests, runaway tests, etc. Recommendations are
    provided for quantities to be monitored during these tests, with related instrumentation,
    calibration and data acquisition systems. Procedures for comparing on-site measurements
    with numerical simulation results are proposed.</p>"
