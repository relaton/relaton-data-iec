abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 defines the set of quality measure elements to
    be used throughout the software product life cycle for the purpose of Software
    Product Quality Requirement and Evaluation (SQuaRE). While some quality measure
    elements can be used as standalone quality measures, their main purpose is to
    be the building blocks for other SQuaRE measurements as described in ISO/IEC TR
    9126-2, ISO/IEC TR 9126-3 and ISO/IEC TR 9126-4. ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 constitutes
    the link between ISO/IEC 9126 and the subsequent SQuaRE series of standards.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 25021:2007 contains informative annexes documenting the cross-reference relationship
    between the quality measure elements and quality measures, characteristics and
    subcharacteristics defined in ISO/IEC 9126.</p><p>The Quality Measurement Division,
    of which ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 is a member, also offers examples of quality measures
    that can be used across the product development life-cycle. These measures are
    defined in the other documents in the division and correspond to the quality characteristics
    in a software product quality model such as that described in the future International
    Standard ISO/IEC 25010 (replacing ISO/IEC 9126-1). ISO/IEC TR 25021:2007 is designed
    to be used, in particular, with other standards in the SQuaRE series that address
    quality requirements (ISO/IEC 25030) and product quality evaluation (the future
    International Standard ISO/IEC 25040).</p>"
