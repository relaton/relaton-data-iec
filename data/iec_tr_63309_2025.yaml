abstract:
- content: 'IEC TR 63309: 2025, which is a Technical Report, provides an introduction
    of active fibres describing key characteristics and measurement methods. For the
    purpose of this document, an active fibre is a silica-based optical fibre doped
    in the core with rare-earth ions to allow optical gain, named rare-earth doped
    fibre. Other fibres enabling optical gain by means of different effects (e.g.
    Raman effect) are not included in the scope of this document.'
