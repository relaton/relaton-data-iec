abstract:
- content: '<p>MPEG-21 provides a framework within which many elements of multimedia
    are brought together. In particular, coded representations of content are juxtaposed
    with metadata descriptors and IPMP protection that apply to the content. This
    leads to a requirement for tools that can create and maintain (e.g. detect or
    extract) an association between content, metadata and IPMP elements within MPEG-21.</p><p>ISO/IEC
    TR 21000-11:2004 describes methodologies for the evaluation of two classes of
    technologies that can create and maintain such associations: "watermarks" and
    "fingerprints", when applied to audio content.</p>'
