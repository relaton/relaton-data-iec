    copying devices and multifunctional devices with various copying modes and a single
    one-sided original. It is applicable to digital copying devices and multifunctional
    devices. It is intended to be used for black-and-white and colour digital copying
    devices and multifunctional devices of any underlying marking technology. ISO/IEC
    29183:2010 includes instructions for the creation of test charts, test setup procedure,
    test procedure, and the reporting requirements for the digital copying productivity
    measurements.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 29183:2010 is not intended to replace manufacturer's
    rated speeds."
