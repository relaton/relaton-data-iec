abstract:
- content: ISO/TR 30112:2014 specifies description formats and functionality for the
    specification of cultural conventions, description formats for character sets,
    and description formats for binding character names to ISO/IEC 10646, plus a set
    of default values for some of these items. The specification is upward compatible
    with POSIX locale specifications - a locale conformant to POSIX specifications
    will also be conformant to specifications in this Technical Report, while the
    reverse condition will not hold. Some of the descriptions are intended to be coded
    in text files to be used via Application Programming Interfaces, that are expected
    to be developed for a number of systems which comply with ISO/IEC 9945. An alignment
    effort has been undertaken for this specification to be aligned with ISO/IEC 9945.
