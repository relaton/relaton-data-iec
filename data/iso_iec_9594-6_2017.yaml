abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 9594-6:2017 defines a number of attribute types and matching
    rules which may be found useful across a range of applications of the Directory.</p><p>Attribute
    types and matching rules fall into three categories, as described below.</p><p>Some
    attribute types and matching rules are used by a wide variety of applications
    or are understood and/or used by the Directory itself.</p><p>NOTE 1 - It is recommended
    that an attribute type or matching rule defined in this Recommendation | International
    Standard be used, in preference to the generation of a new one, whenever it is
    appropriate for the application.</p><p>NOTE 2 - The attribute and context types
    definitions by this Recommendation | International Standard have some associated
    semantics. Such specifications should not be used in situations where these semantics
    do not apply.</p><p>Some attribute types and matching rules are internationally
    standardized, but are application-specific. These are defined in the standards
    associated with the application concerned.</p><p>Any administrative authority
    can define its own attribute types and matching rules for any purpose. These are
    not internationally standardized, and are available to others beyond the administrative
    authority which created them only through bilateral agreement.</p>"
