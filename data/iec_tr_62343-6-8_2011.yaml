abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62343-6-8:2011(E) outlines the categorization of dynamic performance
    requirements for dynamic modules. There are many kinds of dynamic modules in the
    marketplace with many different transient performance requirements. First, they
    are distinguished between the performance requirements for steady state and the
    transient state behaviour. Next are the requirements for transient characteristics
    during the transition period. Finally, a three-level categorization for the transient
    performance requirements is presented.
