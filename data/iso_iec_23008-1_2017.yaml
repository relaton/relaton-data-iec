abstract:
- content: '<p>ISO/IEC 23008-1:2017 specifies MPEG media transport (MMT) technologies,
    which include a single encapsulation format, delivery protocols and signalling
    messages for transport and delivery of multimedia data over heterogeneous packet-switched
    networks for multimedia services. Types of packet-switched networks supported
    by this document include bidirectional networks such as Internet Protocol (IP)
    networks and unidirectional networks such as digital broadcast networks (which
    may or may not use the IP).</p><p>The technologies specified by this document
    belong to one of three functional areas of MMT: media processing unit (MPU) format,
    signalling messages and delivery protocol.</p><p>The MPU format specifies the
    "mpuf" branded ISO-based media file format (ISOBMFF) encapsulating both timed
    and non-timed media contents. The MPU format is a self-contained ISOBMFF structure
    enabling independent consumption of media data, which hides codec-specific details
    from the delivery function.</p><p>The signalling functional area specifies the
    formats of signalling messages carrying information for managing media content
    delivery and consumption, e.g. specific media locations and delivery configuration
    of media contents.</p><p>The delivery functional area specifies the payload formats
    that are independent of media and codec types, which allow fragmentation and aggregation
    of contents encapsulated as specified by this document for delivery using packet-switched
    oriented transport protocols. The delivery functional area also provides an application
    layer transport protocol that allows for advanced delivery of media contents.</p>'
