abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62257-7-3:2018(E) specifies the general requirements for the selection,
    sizing, erection and operation of generator sets in decentralized rural electrification
    systems. It applies to all low voltage combustion engine electricity generator
    sets energized by renewable energy such as biomass gasifier or biogas, or fossil
    fuel such as gasoline or diesel fuel, and designed for supplying electrical power
    to isolated sites used in systems as described in IEC TS 62257-2. The aim of this
    document is to provide users with the appropriate guide to select generator sets
    for using in micropower plant with different configurations and levels of reliability
    and safety of the equipment during its estimated service lifespan. This document
    describes the minimum requirement of generator set functionality and safety requirements
    and does not claim to be an exhaustive instruction manual or design specification.<br
    />\r\nThe main technical changes of this new edition with regard to the previous
    edition are as follows:<br />\r\n- Increased the voltage and power levels to which
    this TS applies.<br />\r\n- Added descriptions of four different types of micropower
    systems and their relevant requirements."
