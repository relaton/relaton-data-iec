abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62271-313:2025 EXV contains both the international standard and
    its extended version (EXV). This extended version of the official IEC Standard
    is available in English only and provides the user with a comprehensive content
    of the Standard. IEC TS 62271-313:2025 EXV includes the content of the references
    made to IEC TS 62271-5:2024.<br /><br />\r\nIEC TS 62271-313:2025 is applicable
    to direct current circuit-breakers (hereafter termed DC circuit-breakers) for
    indoor or outdoor installation having direct voltages of 100 kV and above for
    operation on DC transmission and distribution systems. This document includes
    the (mechanical) switching devices, including the residual current interruption
    devices, and their operating devices, power electronic switches, primary auxiliary
    circuits and energy dissipation systems, as well as their controls. Depending
    on design and system needs, operation can be for one current direction only (unidirectional)
    or for both directions (bidirectional)."
