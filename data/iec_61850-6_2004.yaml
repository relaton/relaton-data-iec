abstract:
- content: Specifies a file format for describing communication related IED (Intelligent
    Electronic Device) configurations and IED parameters, communication system configurations,
    switchyard (function) structures, and the relations between them. The purpose
    is to exchange IED capability descriptions, and SA system descriptions between
    IED engineering tools and the system engineering tool(s) of different manufacturers
    in a compatible way. Is to be used together with IEC 61850-5 and the IEC 61850-7
    series.
