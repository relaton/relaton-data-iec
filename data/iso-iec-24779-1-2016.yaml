    <p>ISO/IEC 24779-1:2016 multi-part International Standard specifies a family of icons and symbols used in association with devices for biometric enrolment, verification and/or identification. This part of ISO/IEC 24779 describes the approach used in specifying icons and the range of biometric technologies for which icon and symbol development is considered. The symbols and icons are intended to show the modality of biometrics and to advise the necessity of appropriate preparation for and behaviour required when using the biometric systems. They are also intended to assist subjects by guiding them as they use the biometric systems.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24779-1:2016 Standard focuses on both enrolment and recognition processes. Icons and symbols used exclusively for biometric enrolment are not specified since most enrolment systems will be supervised, and an attendant will be available to explain to biometric capture subjects what to do.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24779-1:2016 Standard focuses on communication with the data capture subject. Operators could use this part of ISO/IEC 24779, but they might need additional symbols and information.</p>
