abstract:
- content: <p>This document specifies a method for determining scanning productivity
    by measuring "scanning speed", "scan to network folder speed" and "scan to PC
    speed". It includes test files, test setup procedure, test procedure and the reporting
    requirements for the scanning productivity measurements. This document is applicable
    to scanning devices including but not limited to multi-function devices, networked
    scanners and single-function scanners of any underlying scanning technology.</p><p>This
    document is applicable to devices which are able to scan a media size of A4/8,5"
    Ã— 11" and which have an automatic document feeder (ADF). It is also applicable
    to devices which have the ability to scan to network folder, or folder on PC and
    do not require, but can use, other application programs on a computer or another
    device to perform a scanning job.</p><p>This document does not apply to testing
    and measurement of scan to USB, scan to local hard drive or other storage medium
    that is part of or plugged into the scanner.</p><p>This document is not intended
    to be used for image quality measurement, document or record management of any
    scanned images.</p>
