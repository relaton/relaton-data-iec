abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 27050-3:2017 provides requirements and guidance on activities
    in electronic discovery, including, but not limited to, identification, preservation,
    collection, processing, review, analysis and production of electronically stored
    information (ESI). In addition, ISO/IEC 27050-3:2017 specifies relevant measures
    that span the lifecycle of the ESI from its initial creation through to final
    disposition.</p><p>ISO/IEC 27050-3:2017 is relevant to both non-technical and
    technical personnel involved in some or all of the electronic discovery activities.
    It is important to note that the requirements and guidance are not intended to
    contradict or supersede local jurisdictional laws and regulations and it is expected
    that care is exercised by the user to ensure compliance with the prevailing jurisdictional
    requirements.</p>"
