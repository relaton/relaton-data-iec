abstract:
- content: "This is one of a set of standards describing the characteristics of a\nspecific
    home control system called the Home Electronic System, HES. It\nspecifies the
    characteristics of the Universal Interface (UI) Class 1 that connects\ndevices
    to the home network in an HES for control applications;\nit informs as to the
    usefulness of the principles of a UI and forms a basis for new\nwork in this field.
    \n\n\nThis standard specifies a generic interface for a device to connect to a
    home control network\nvia a Network Adaptor Unit. The home control network signals
    may be carried on the cabling\nsystem being specified in ISO/IEC 15018 (Information
    technology - Integrated cabling for residential and SOHO (Small Office, Home Office)
    environments --\nunder development)."
