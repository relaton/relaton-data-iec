    <p>ISO/IEC 19099:2014 specifies the following:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Resource Allocation Profile, which sets the basic resource allocation pattern for resource pools, allocations, and setting data. It also defines the resource-pool-lifecycle management and relationships.</li>
    <li>System Virtualization Profile - an autonomous profile that specifies the minimum top-level object model needed for the representation of host systems and the discovery of hosted virtual computer systems. In addition, it specifies a service for the manipulation of virtual computer systems and their resources, including operations for the creation, deletion, and modification of virtual computer systems and operations for the addition or removal of virtual resources to or from virtual computer systems.</li>
    <li>Allocation Capabilities Profile, which extends the management capability of referencing profiles by adding the ability to represent the default, supported and range of property values for resource allocation requests for a given resource, and the mutability of properties in a Resource Allocation Setting Data instance.</li>
    <li>Processor Resource Virtualization Profile - a component profile that extends the management capabilities of the specialized profiles by adding the support to represent and manage the allocation of processor resources to virtual systems.</li>
    <li>Memory Resource Virtualization Profile - a component DMTF management profile that extends the management capabilities of the referencing profile by adding the support to represent and manage the allocation of memory to virtual systems.</li>
    <li>Storage Resource Virtualization Profile - a component profile that extends the management capabilities of the referencing profile by adding the support to represent and manage the allocation of storage to virtual systems.</li>
    <li>Ethernet Port Resource Virtualization Profile - a component DMTF management profile that extends the management capabilities of the referencing profile by adding the support to represent and manage the allocation of Ethernet ports to virtual systems.</li>
    <li>Virtual System Profile - an autonomous profile that defines the minimum object model needed to provide for the inspection of a virtual system and its components. In addition, it defines optional basic control operations for activating, deactivating, pausing, or suspending a virtual system.</li>
    <li>Generic Device Resource Virtualization Profile - a concrete component profile that specializes the abstract Resource Allocation Profile and the abstract Allocation Capabilities Profile.</li>
