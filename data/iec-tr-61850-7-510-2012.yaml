  content: 'IEC/TR 61850-7-510:2012(E) provides explanations on how to use the Logical
    Nodes defined in IEC 61850-7-410 as well as other documents in the IEC 61850 series
    to model complex control functions in power plants, including variable speed pumped
    storage power plants. This publication is to be used in conjunction with IEC 61850-7-410
    which introduced the general modelling concepts of IEC 61850 to hydroelectric
    power plants. Keywords: power utility, automation, communication, hydroelectric'
