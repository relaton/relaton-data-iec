  content: "IEC 60332-3-25:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60332-2-25:2018
    covers category D for methods of test for the assessment of vertical flame spread
    of vertically mounted bunched wires or cables, electrical or optical, under defined
    conditions. This document relates only to small cables of overall diameter 12
    mm or smaller and cross-section of 35 mm2 or smaller installed on the test ladder
    to achieve a nominal total volume of non-metallic material of 0,5 l/m of test
    sample. The flame application time is 20 min. The method of mounting uses the
    front of the standard ladder in touching formation only. The category is intended
    for use with small cables where very low volumes of non-metallic material are
    required to be evaluated. The test is intended for type approval testing. The
    requirements for the selection of cables for testing are given in Annex A. The
    flame spread is measured as the extent of damage of the cable sample. This procedure
    can be used to demonstrate the cable’s ability to limit flame spread. A recommended
    performance requirement is given in Annex B. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2000 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition constitutes
    a technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) all pre-existing categories
    of test have been retained and updated;<br />\r\nb) a new category (category D)
    has been added to cater for testing at very low non-metallic volumes.<br />\r\nIt
    has the status of a group safety publication in accordance with IEC Guide 104."
