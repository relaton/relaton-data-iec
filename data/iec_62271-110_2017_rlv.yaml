abstract:
- content: "IEC 62271-110:2017 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62271-110:2017
    is applicable to AC switching devices designed for indoor or outdoor installation,
    for operation at frequencies of 50 Hz and 60 Hz on systems having voltages above
    1 000 V and applied for inductive current switching. It is applicable to switching
    devices (including circuit-breakers in accordance with IEC 62271-100) that are
    used to switch highâ€‘voltage motor currents and shunt reactor currents and also
    to high-voltage contactors used to switch high-voltage motor currents as covered
    by IEC 62271-106. This fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition published
    in 2012 and constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n-
    all switching devices are now covered, not only circuit-breakers;<br />\r\n- a
    limited number of T10 tests no longer covers shunt-reactor switching tests below
    52 kV;<br />\r\n- evaluation and reporting of a re-ignition-free arcing time window
    has been added.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of December 2017 and
    of February 2018 have been included in this copy."
