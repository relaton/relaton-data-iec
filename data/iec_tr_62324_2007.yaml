abstract:
- content: This technical report is applicable to the Raman gain efficiency measurement
    of a single-mode transmission optical fibre. It is useful in assessing the fibre's
    performance in Raman amplified transmission systems. This technical report describes
    a method that uses two unmodulated continuous waves to measure the Raman gain
    efficiency of a single-mode transmission optical fibre. This parameter assesses
    the fibre's efficiency at converting input pump power to information signal power.
    This second edition differs from the first in that in the previous edition, in
    the paragraph before Figure 2, there was an approximation of the relationship
    between wavelength and optical frequency that led to some inconsistencies in interlaboratory
    agreement. This approximation has been removed.
