abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62600-2:2019 provides design requirements to ensure the engineering
    integrity of wave, ocean, tidal and river current energy converters, collectively
    referred to as marine energy converters. Its purpose is to provide an appropriate
    level of protection against damage from all hazards that may lead to catastrophic
    failure of the MEC structural, mechanical, electrical or control systems.<br />\r\nThis
    document provides requirements for MEC main structure, appendages, seabed interface,
    mechanical systems and electrical systems as they pertain to the viability of
    the device under site-specific environmental conditions. This document applies
    to MECs that are either floating or fixed to the seafloor or shore and are unmanned
    during operational periods.<br />\r\nIn addition to environmental conditions,
    this document addresses design conditions (normal operation, operation with fault,
    parked, etc.); design categories (normal, extreme, abnormal and transport); and
    limit states (serviceability, ultimate, fatigue and accidental) using a limit
    state design methodology. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2016.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) The second edition sets
    forth design conditions unique to marine energy converters."
