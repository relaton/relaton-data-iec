  content: "IEC 61300-3-35:2015 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\nIEC 61300-3-35:2015 describes
    methods for quantitatively assessing the end face quality of a polished fibre
    optic connector or of a fibre optic transceiver using a fibre-stub type interface.
    Sub-surface cracks and fractures are not considered in this standard. In general,
    the methods described in this standard apply to 125 µ cladding fibres contained
    within a ferrule and intended for use with sources of ≤ 2 W of input power. However,
    portions are applicable to non-ferruled connectors and other fibre types. Those
    portions are identified where appropriate. It is not the intention of this standard
    that the size of scratches should be measured, the dimensions and requirements
    are selected such that they can be estimated. There is no need to measure for
    example if a scratch is 2,3 µm wide. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2009 and constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\n- modification to the title;<br />\r\n- addition of
    some terms and definitions;<br />\r\n- reconsideration of the specific values
    of Tables 1 to 4 to reflect the current market situation;<br />\r\n- addition
    of visual requirements for single-mode transceivers using a fibre-stub interface
    in Table 3;<br />\r\n- addition of a sentence in 4.1 concerning the susceptibility
    of the methods to system variability.<br />\r\nKeywords: end face quality of a
    polished fibre optic connector, fibre optic transceiver using a fibre-stub type
    interface"
