    evaluation methods for the security evaluation of quantum key distribution (QKD).
    It also describes evaluation activities that constitute the test and evaluation
    methods for the security functional requirements on the implementation of QKD
    protocols, the quantum optical components and conventional network components
    in QKD modules. Moreover, supplementary evaluation activities for security assurance
    requirements are provided to support the security evaluation of QKD with appropriate
    assurance levels.</span></p>'
