abstract:
- content: The Fibre Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314, is intended
    for use in a high-performance general purpose multi-node network and is designed
    for efficient operation with a peak data rate of 100 Mbit&#x2F;s. It uses a Token
    Ring architecture with optical fibre as the transmission medium. FDDI provides
    for hundreds of nodes operating over an extent of tens of kilometers. The Physical
    Layer Protocol (PHY) specifies the upper sublayer of the Physical Layer for the
    FDDI. As such, it presents the specifications and services provided for conforming
    FDDI attachment devices. PHY specifies the data encode and decode, framing, and
    clocking requirements. PHY also specifies the elasticity buffer, smoothing, and
    repeat filter functions. This part of ISO&#x2F;IEC 9314 for PHY-2 is an enhancement
    to the original FDDI standard on PHY (ISO 9314-1).
