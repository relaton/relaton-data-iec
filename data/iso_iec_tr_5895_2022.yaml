abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 5895:2022 This document clarifies and increases the application
    and implementation of ISO/IEC 30111 and ISO/IEC 29147 in multi-party coordinated
    vulnerability disclosure (MPCVD) settings, including the evolving commonly adopted
    practices in this area, by articulating:<br />\r\n- The MPCVD life cycle and application
    of coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) stages (preparation, receipt, verification,
    remediation[1] development, release, post-release) in MPCVD settings.<br />\r\n-
    Stakeholders involved in MPCVD include users, vendors (coordinating, mitigating,
    and dependent vendors), reporters, and non-vendor coordinators (entities defined
    in ISO/IEC 29147 and ISO/IEC 30111).<br />\r\n- The exchange of information between
    stakeholders during the vulnerability handling and disclosure process in a MPCVD
    settings.<br />\r\nClarifying the application of ISO/IEC 30111 and ISO/IEC 29147
    in MPCVD settings illustrates the benefits of vulnerability disclosure processes.<br
    />\r\n[1] Remediation is a defined term used in ISO/IEC 30111 and ISO/IEC 29147.
    This document uses the term \"remediation\" and verb “remediate” in the context
    of this definition."
