abstract:
- content: "IEC 62282-8-201:2024 RLV contains both the official IEC International
    Standard and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English
    only and provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between
    the official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62282-8-201:2024
    defines the evaluation methods of typical performances for electric energy storage
    systems using hydrogen. It is applicable to the systems that use electrochemical
    reaction devices for both power charge and discharge. This document applies to
    systems that are designed and used for service and operation in stationary locations
    (indoor and outdoor). It specifies performance evaluation methods for electric
    energy storage systems using hydrogen that employ electrochemical reactions both
    for water and steam electrolysis and electric power generation. This document
    is intended for power-to-power systems which typically employ a set of electrolyser
    and fuel cell, or a reversible cell for devices of electric charge and discharge.
    This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2020.<br
    />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) consideration of systems connected to hydrogen
    supply infrastructure (hydrogen grids, vessels, caverns or pipelines);<br />\r\nb)
    hydrogen input and output rate is added in the system parameters (5.10);<br />\r\nc)
    electric energy storage capacity test is revised (6.2);<br />\r\nd) roundtrip
    electrical efficiency test is revised (6.5);<br />\r\ne) hydrogen input and output
    rate test is added (6.6.6)."
