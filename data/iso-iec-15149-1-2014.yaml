    <p>ISO/IEC 15149-1:2014 specifies the physical layer and media access control layer protocols of wireless network over a magnetic field in a low frequency band (~300 kHz) for wireless communication in harsh environment (around metal, underwater, underground, etc.).</p>
    <p>The physical layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>low carrier frequency for large magnetic field area and reliable communication in harsh environment;</li>
    <li>simple and robust modulation for a low implementation cost and error performance;</li>
    <li>variable coding and bandwidth for a link adaptation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The media access control layer protocol is designed for the following scope:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>simple and efficient network topology for low power consumption;</li>
    <li>variable superframe structure for compact and efficient data transmission;</li>
    <li>dynamic address assignment for small packet size and efficient address management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 15149-1:2014 supports several kbps data transmission in wireless network within a distance of several metres. It can be applied to various services such as the following areas:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>environmental industry to manage pollution levels in soil and water using wireless underground or underwater sensors;</li>
    <li>construction industry to monitor the integrity of buildings and bridges using wireless, inner-corrosion sensors;</li>
    <li>consumer-electronics industry to detect food spoilage in wet, airtight storage areas and transfer the sensing data from the inside to the outside;</li>
    <li>agricultural industry to manage the moisture level as well as mineral status in soil using wireless, buried sensors;</li>
    <li>transportation industry to manage road conditions and traffic information using wireless, underground sensors.</li>
    </ul>
