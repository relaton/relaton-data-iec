abstract:
- content: 'Aims at defining a qualification profile for laminators, making audits
    simpler and less frequently required. Less paper work would thus be necessary
    as customers and suppliers work closer to meeting each others'' needs. A diskette
    is also available with the hardcopy of this PAS. Two zipped files are available
    through Webstore: the pdf file of the PAS itself and the contents of the diskette.'
