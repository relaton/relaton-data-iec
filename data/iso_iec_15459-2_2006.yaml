abstract:
- content: "<p>Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as address, order number, contents of the item, weight, sender, batch or
    lot number, etc. There are considerable benefits if the identity of the item is
    common between all the relevant parties.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006 specifies
    the procedural requirements to maintain a non-significant, unique identifier for
    item management applications, and outlines the obligations of the Registration
    Authority and Issuing Agencies.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006 excludes those items
    where ISO has designated Maintenance Agencies or Registration Authorities to provide
    identification schemes. It does not apply to</p><ul><li>freight containers, because
    their unique coding is specified in ISO 6346,<em>Freight containers -- Coding,
    identification and marking</em>;</li><li>vehicles, because their unique identification
    is specified in ISO 3779,<em>Road vehicles -- Vehicle identification number (VIN)
    -- Content and structure</em>;</li><li>car radios, because their unique identification
    is specified in ISO 10486,<em>Passenger cars -- Car radio identification number
    (CRIN)</em>.</li></ul><p>The exclusion also applies to ISO 2108,<em>Information
    and documentation -- International standard book number (ISBN)</em> and ISO 3297,<em>Information
    and documentation -- International standard serial number (ISSN)</em>.</p><p>NOTE
    The scope of each of ISO 2108 and ISO 3297 identifies the title rather than the
    individual copy of a book or periodical. As such, the level of identification
    achieved is at a level higher than the unique identity required to be compliant
    with ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006.</p>"
