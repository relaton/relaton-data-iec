abstract:
- content: 'Unique identification can occur at many different levels in the supply
    chain, at the transport unit, at the item level, and elsewhere. Such distinct
    entities are often handled by several parties: the sender, the receiver, one or
    more carriers, customs authorities, etc. Each of these parties must be able to
    identify and trace the item so that reference can be made to associated information
    such as address, order number, contents of the item, weight, sender, batch or
    lot number, etc. There are considerable benefits if the identity of the item is
    common between all the relevant parties. ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006 specifies the procedural
    requirements to maintain a non-significant, unique identifier for item management
    applications, and outlines the obligations of the Registration Authority and Issuing
    Agencies.ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006 excludes those items where ISO has designated Maintenance
    Agencies or Registration Authorities to provide identification schemes. It does
    not apply tofreight containers, because their unique coding is specified in ISO
    6346, Freight containers -- Coding, identification and marking; vehicles, because
    their unique identification is specified in ISO 3779, Road vehicles -- Vehicle
    identification number (VIN) -- Content and structure; car radios, because their
    unique identification is specified in ISO 10486, Passenger cars -- Car radio identification
    number (CRIN).The exclusion also applies to ISO 2108, Information and documentation
    -- International standard book number (ISBN) and ISO 3297, Information and documentation
    -- International standard serial number (ISSN). NOTE The scope of each of ISO
    2108 and ISO 3297 identifies the title rather than the individual copy of a book
    or periodical. As such, the level of identification achieved is at a level higher
    than the unique identity required to be compliant with ISO/IEC 15459-2:2006.'
