abstract:
- content: "The data protocol used to exchange information in a radio-frequency identification
    (RFID) system for item management is specified in ISO/IEC 15961:2004 and in ISO/IEC
    15962:2004. Both are required for a complete understanding of the data protocol
    in its entirety; but each focuses on one particular interface:\r\n\r\n\tISO/IEC
    15961:2004 addresses the interface with the application system.\r\n\tISO/IEC 15962:2004
    deals with the processing of data and its presentation to the RF tag, and the
    initial processing of data captured from the RF tag.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15962:2004
    focuses on encoding the transfer syntax, as defined in ISO/IEC 15961:2004 according
    to the application commands defined in that International Standard. The encodation
    is in a Logical Memory as a software analogue of the physical memory of the RF
    tag being addressed by the interrogator.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC 15962:2004\r\n\r\n\tdefines
    the encoded structure of object identifiers;\r\n\tspecifies the data compaction
    rules that apply to the encoded data;\r\n\tspecifies a Precursor for encoding
    syntax features efficiently;\r\n\tspecifies formatting rules for the data, e.g.
    depending on whether a directory is used or not;\r\n\tdefines how application
    commands, e.g. to lock data, are transferred to the Tag Driver;\r\n\tdefines other
    communication to the application."
