abstract:
- content: "<p>The data protocol used to exchange information in a radio-frequency
    identification (RFID) system for item management is specified in ISO/IEC 15961:2004
    and in ISO/IEC 15962:2004. Both are required for a complete understanding of the
    data protocol in its entirety; but each focuses on one particular interface:</p><ul><li>ISO/IEC
    15961:2004 addresses the interface with the application system.</li><li>ISO/IEC
    15962:2004 deals with the processing of data and its presentation to the RF tag,
    and the initial processing of data captured from the RF tag.</li></ul><p>ISO/IEC
    15962:2004 focuses on encoding the transfer syntax, as defined in ISO/IEC 15961:2004
    according to the application commands defined in that International Standard.
    The encodation is in a Logical Memory as a software analogue of the physical memory
    of the RF tag being addressed by the interrogator.</p><p>ISO/IEC 15962:2004</p><ul><li>defines
    the encoded structure of object identifiers;</li><li>specifies the data compaction
    rules that apply to the encoded data;</li><li>specifies a Precursor for encoding
    syntax features efficiently;</li><li>specifies formatting rules for the data,
    e.g. depending on whether a directory is used or not;</li><li>defines how application
    commands, e.g. to lock data, are transferred to the Tag Driver;</li><li>defines
    other communication to the application.</li></ul>"
