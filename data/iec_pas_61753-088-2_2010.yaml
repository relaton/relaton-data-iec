abstract:
- content: IEC/PAS 61753-088-2:2010(E) contains the minimum initial test and measurement
    requirements and severities which a non-connectorised single-mode fibre optic
    Local Area Network Wavelength Division Multiplexing (LAN WDM) device with channel
    spacing of 800 GHz needs to satisfy in order to be categorised as meeting the
    requirements of category C - Controlled environments, as defined in Annex A of
    IEC 61753-1.
