abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC TR 19791:2006 provides guidance and criteria for the security evaluation
    of operational systems. It provides an extension to the scope of ISO/IEC 15408,
    by taking into account a number of critical aspects of operational systems not
    addressed in ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation. The principal extensions that are required
    address evaluation of the operational environment surrounding the target of evaluation,
    and the decomposition of complex operational systems into security domains that
    can be separately evaluated.ISO/IEC TR 19791:2006 providesa definition and model
    for operational systems;a description of the extensions to ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation
    concepts needed to evaluate such operational systems;a methodology and process
    for performing the security evaluation of operational systems;additional security
    evaluation criteria to address those aspects of operational systems not covered
    by the ISO/IEC 15408 evaluation criteria.ISO/IEC TR 19791:2006 permits the incorporation
    of security products evaluated against ISO/IEC 15408 into operational systems
    evaluated as a whole using ISO/IEC TR 19791:2006.ISO/IEC TR 19791:2006 is limited
    to the security evaluation of operational systems and does not consider other
    forms of system assessment. It does not define techniques for the identification,
    assessment and acceptance of operational risk.
