    <p>ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 provides general requirements for processes of "the information technology (IT) project performance benchmarking framework" by prescribing: </p>
    <ul>
    <li>the requirements for the processes for individual activities within the benchmarking framework (e.g. conduct benchmarking, maintain repository, submit data),</li>
    <li>the tasks necessary to successfully execute activities and equip them with components, both of which are defined in ISO/IEC 29155-1. </li>
    <li>ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 is intended for use by any stakeholder(s) of IT project performance benchmarking (e.g. benchmarking user, benchmark provider, benchmarking service provider, and IT project team).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following are examples of how ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 can be used:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>by a systems and software supplier to implement a benchmarking process to estimate and/or evaluate performance of an IT project,</li>
    <li>by a systems and software acquirer (or a third-party agent) for evaluating the performance of the supplier's IT project,</li>
    <li>by a benchmark provider to implement processes to collect and analyse IT project data and provide benchmarks,</li>
    <li>by a benchmarking service provider to implement various services (e.g. providing instruments for benchmarking, or conducting an instance of benchmarking for a benchmarking user).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ISO/IEC 29155-2:2013 does not prescribe how to utilize benchmarking results, nor does it prescribe the name, format, or explicit content of the documentation that results from the benchmarking processes.</p>
