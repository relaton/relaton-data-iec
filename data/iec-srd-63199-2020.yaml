  content: "IEC SRD 63199:2020 presents the current status of the IEC systems committee
    Smart Energy (SyC SE) development plan for readers (not limited to IEC smart energy
    related members). The document identifies items that require standardization,
    their current status and work required, possibly by multiple technical committees
    or working groups, to address any issues.<br />\r\nSince the content of this document
    represents a snapshot of the dynamic/living standardization processes to be updated,
    it is subject to future changes.<br />\r\nUsers’ perspectives are considered.
    For example, the analysis of influences of each item (development impact and chance
    to fill gaps) are stated."
