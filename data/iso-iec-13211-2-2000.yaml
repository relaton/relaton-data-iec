    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13211 is designed to promote the</p>
    <p>applicability and portability of Prolog modules that contain</p>
    <p>Prolog text complying with the requirements of the Programming</p>
    <p>Language Prolog as specified in this part of ISO/IEC 13211.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13211 specifies:</p>
    <p>a) The representation of Prolog text that constitutes a Prolog</p>
    <p>module,</p>
    <p>b) The constraints that shall be satisfied to prepare Prolog</p>
    <p>modules for execution, and</p>
    <p>c) The requirements, restrictions and limits imposed on a</p>
    <p>conforming Prolog processor that processes modules.</p>
    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 13211 does not specify:</p>
    <p>a) The size or number of Prolog modules that will exceed the</p>
    <p>capacity of any specific data processing system or language</p>
    <p>processor, or the actions to be taken when the limit is</p>
    <p>exceeded,</p>
    <p>b) The methods of activating the Prolog processor or the</p>
    <p>set of commands used to control the environment in which</p>
    <p>Prolog modules are prepared for execution,</p>
    <p>c) The mechanisms by which Prolog modules are loaded,</p>
    <p>d) The relationship between Prolog modules and the</p>
    <p>processor-specific file system.</p>
    <p><b>1.1 Notes</b></p>
    <p>Notes in this part of ISO/IEC 13211 have no effect on the</p>
    <p>language, Prolog text, module text or Prolog processors that are</p>
    <p>defined as conforming to this part of ISO/IEC 13211. Reasons</p>
    <p>for including a note include:</p>
    <p>a) Cross references to other clauses and subclauses of this</p>
    <p>part of ISO/IEC 13211 in order to help readers find their</p>
    <p>way around,</p>
    <p>b) Warnings when a built-in predicate as defined in this part</p>
    <p>of ISO/IEC 13211 has a different meaning in some existing</p>
    <p>implementations.</p>
