  content: "IEC 60335-2-28:2021 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-28:2021
    deals with the safety of electric sewing machines for household and similar use,
    their rated voltage being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances and
    480 V for other appliances, including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances.<br />\r\nOverlock machines and electrical sets
    are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAppliances not intended for normal
    household use, but that nevertheless can be a source of danger to the public,
    such as sewing machines intended to be used by laymen in shops and in light industry,
    are within the scope of this standard.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this
    standard deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered
    by all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account<br />\r\n- persons (including children) whose physical, sensory or mental
    capabilities; or lack of experience and knowledge prevents them from using the
    appliance safely without supervision or instruction;<br />\r\n- children playing
    with the appliance.<br />\r\nAttention is drawn to the fact that<br />\r\n- for
    appliances intended to be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional
    requirements can be necessary;<br />\r\n- in many countries additional requirements
    are specified by the national health authorities, the national authorities responsible
    for the protection of labour and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis standard does
    not apply to<br />\r\n- appliances intended exclusively for industrial purposes;<br
    />\r\n- appliances intended to be used in locations where special conditions prevail,
    such as the presence of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br
    />\r\nThis fifth edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in
    2002 and Amendment 1:2008. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br
    />\r\nb) some notes have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 11.7, 22.14,
    22.101);<br />\r\nc) clarification of requirements for battery-operated appliances
    (Clause 1, 3.1.9, 11.7, B.11.1);<br />\r\nd) introduction of limits on the temperature
    rise of external accessible surfaces (Clause 11);<br />\r\ne) application of test
    probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1, 20.2).<br />\r\nThis Part 2 is to be used
    in conjunction with the latest edition of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless
    that edition precludes it; in that case, the latest edition that does not preclude
    it is used. It was established on the basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that
    standard."
