abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 23271:2012 defines the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI)
    in which applications written in multiple high-level languages can be executed
    in different system environments without the need to rewrite those applications
    to take into consideration the unique characteristics of those environments. It
    consists of six partitions.</p><ul><li>Partition I describes the overall architecture
    of the CLI, and provides the normative description of the Common Type System (CTS),
    the Virtual Execution System (VES), and the Common Language Specification (CLS).
    It also provides an informative description of the metadata.</li><li>Partition
    II provides the normative description of the metadata: its physical layout (as
    a file format), its logical contents (as a set of tables and their relationships),
    and its semantics (as seen from a hypothetical assembler, ILAsm).</li><li>Partition
    III describes the Common Intermediate Language (CIL) instruction set.</li><li>Partition
    IV provides an overview of the CLI Libraries, and a specification of their factoring
    into Profiles and Libraries. A companion file, CLILibrary.xml, considered to be
    part of this partition, but distributed in XML format, provides details of each
    class, value type, and interface in the CLI Libraries.</li><li>Partition V describes
    a standard way to interchange debugging information between CLI producers and
    consumers.</li><li>Partition VI contains some sample programs written in CIL Assembly
    Language (ILAsm), information about a particular implementation of an assembler,
    a machine-readable description of the CIL instruction set which can be used to
    derive parts of the grammar used by this assembler as well as other tools that
    manipulate CIL, a set of guidelines used in the design of the libraries of Partition
    IV, and portability considerations.</li></ul>"
