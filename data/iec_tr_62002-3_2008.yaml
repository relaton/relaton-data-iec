abstract:
- content: IEC 62002-3:2008(E) is defining the minimum requirements for a terminal
    measurement interface to be used in test systems designed to verify the terminal
    conformance according IEC 62002-1 and IEC 62002-2. The interface is especially
    designed to be used with terminal category c), hand-held portable convergence
    terminals, but can obviously be used with other terminal categories as well (see
    IEC 62002-1, Clause 4). The measurement interface is used to control the terminal
    and read the degradation information from the terminal. The test signal interface
    (terminal input) is specified in the IEC 62002-2 and is not part of this Technical
    Report.
