    <p>ISO/IEC 19775, X3D, defines a software system that integrates network-enabled 3D graphics and multimedia. Conceptually, each X3D application is a 3D time-based space that contains graphic and aural objects that can be dynamically modified through a variety of mechanisms. This part of ISO/IEC 19775 defines the architecture and base components of X3D.</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 19775-1:2008 does not define physical devices or any other implementation-dependent concepts (<i>e.g.</i>, screen resolution and input devices). It is intended for a wide variety of devices and applications, and provides wide latitude in interpretation and implementation of the functionality.</p>
