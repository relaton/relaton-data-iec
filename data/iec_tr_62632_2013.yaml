    IEC/TR 62632:2013(E), which is a technical report, describes a variety of nanoscale contacts and nano-interconnects used in research and development and in present-day products. The intent of this technical report is to identify nanoscale contacts and nano-interconnects that will be common in products, to describe the state-of-the-art and to describe some key features and issues related to these contacts. In particular, the following aspects are discussed for each of the nanoscale contacts or nano-interconnects listed:<br />
    - type and configuration of the nanoscale contacts and interconnects formed;<br />
    - requirements of the nanoscale contacts and interconnects in products;<br />
    - fabrication technologies, processes, and process controls used to make the nanoscale contacts and interconnects;<br />
    - characterization techniques used to quantify nanoscale contacts and nano-interconnects;<br />
    - functionality and performance of nanoscale contacts and interconnects;<br />
    - reliability of the nanoscale contacts and interconnects in products;<br />
    - and expectations of when the product and the associated nanoscale contacts will reach the market. This technical report points out the positive and negative characteristics of the nanoscale contacts and interconnects in each technology or nanomaterial discussed. This information may be helpful to product designers and researchers in their efforts to bring other nano-enabled products to the market. Recommendations for the formation and use of nanoscale contacts and interconnects are also indicated.
    Key words: nanotechnology, nanocontact, nano-contact
