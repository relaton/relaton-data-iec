    <p>This specification, EPUB Publications 3.0.1, defines semantics and conformance requirements for EPUB® Publications, including the format of the Package Document that describes each Rendition of the content and rules for how this document and other Publication Resources are associated to create a conforming EPUB Publication.</p>
    <p>This specification is one of a family of related specifications that compose EPUB 3, the third major revision of an interchange and delivery format for digital publications based on XML and Web Standards. It is meant to be read and understood in concert with the other specifications that make up EPUB 3:</p>
    <p>The EPUB 3 Overview [EPUB3Overview], which provides an informative overview of EPUB and a roadmap to the rest of the EPUB 3 documents. The Overview should be read first.</p>
    <p>EPUB Content Documents 3.0.1 [ContentDocs301], which defines profiles of XHTML, SVG and CSS for use in the context of EPUB Publications.</p>
    <p>EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) 3.0.1 [OCF301], which defines a file format and</p>
    <p>processing model for encapsulating a set of related resources into a single-file (ZIP) EPUBContainer.</p>
    <p>EPUB Media Overlays 3.0.1 [MediaOverlays301], which defines a format and a processing model for synchronization of text and audio.</p>
    <p>This specification supersedes EPUB Publications 3.0 [Publications30]. Refer to [EPUB3Changes] for information on differences between this specification and its predecessor.</p>
