    <p>ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 provides a common language for describing digital learning resources to facilitate matching of those resources to learners' accessibility needs and preferences (as defined in  ISO/IEC 24751-2). This description is one side of a pair of descriptions used in matching user needs and preferences with education delivery (as described in  ISO/IEC 24751-1).</p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 discusses the basic principles adhered to in developing this model for describing digital learning resources. It explains: the assumptions made in developing ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008, the notion of an original and adapted resource, the major categories of metadata for original and adapted resources, the notion of an access mode for a resource, what is meant by adaptability, and the importance of interoperability and the role played by consistent implementation in interoperability. </p>
    <p>It contains the information model for ISO/IEC 24751-3, including the attribute, allowed occurrence and datatype of each element. </p>
    <p>It defines and describes how the terms in the information model should be used, and explains how ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 can be extended. </p>
    <p>It discusses conformance to ISO/IEC 24751-3. Conformance is dependent on the role played by the conformant technology. Conformance requirements for both education delivery applications, resources and metadata authoring tools are explained. </p>
    <p>ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 provides</p>
    <ul>
    <li>a consolidated list of all the terms defined in ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008, sorted in French alphabetical order, </li>
    <li>the ISO French language equivalent terms and definitions, and</li>
    <li>the codes representing the gender of the French terms. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The vocabulary codes, values and associated rules of application are defined. An informative list of recommended default values for the learner preferences and needs is provided.</p>
    <p>It lists existing bindings of the IMS Access for All Metadata Specification Version 1 (ACCMD) that serves as the reference specification for ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008.</p>
    <p>It describes information scenarios for applying ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 and gives informative implementation examples. </p>
    <p>Use of ISO/IEC 24751-3:2008 will assist in matching individual learner needs in a computer-mediated learning environment with the necessary user interface and resources needed to meet those needs. </p>
