abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 4005-2:2023 This document describes communication protocols for
    the physical and data link layer of shared communication, which is a wireless
    distributed communication network for units related with UAs in level II.<br />\r\nPhysical
    layer includes frame structure, encoding procedure, physical layer procedure and
    coexistence operations. Data link layer includes channel and slot, resource management,
    broadcast and exchange of data, synchronization, security, and interface with
    upper layer and other communication layers."
