    <p>This document specifies two versions of a mapping from any XSD Schema into an Abstract Syntax Notation One (ASN.1) schema. The ASN.1 schema for both versions support the same semantics and validate the same set of XML documents.</p>
    <p>This document specifies the final XER encoding instructions that are to be applied as part of the defined mapping to ASN.1 types, but does not specify which syntactic form is to be used for the specification of those final XER encoding instructions, or the order or manner of their assignment.</p>
    <p>NOTE – Implementers of tools generating these mappings may choose any syntactic form or order of assignment that results in the specified final XER encoding instructions being applied. Examples in this document generally use the type prefix form, but use of an XER Encoding Control Section may be preferred for the mapping of a complete XSD Schema, as a matter of style.</p>
    <p>There are different ways (syntactically) of assigning XER encoding instructions for use in EXTENDED-XER encodings (e.g., use of ASN.1 type prefix encoding instructions or use of an XER encoding control section). The choice of these syntactic forms is a matter of style and lies outside the scope of this document.</p>
