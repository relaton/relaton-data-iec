abstract:
- content: "IEC 60494-1:2013 specifies the general assembly characteristics which
    are to be applied to pantographs, to enable current collection from the overhead
    contact line system. It also specifies the tests the pantographs have to perform,
    excluding insulators. The main technical changes with regard to the previous edition
    are as follows:\r\n- simplification and standardization of the tolerances for
    static contact force;\r\n- definition of a new investigation test &quot;Measurement
    of mean static contact force at ambient temperature&quot;;\r\n- deletion of combined
    test &quot;Total contact force&quot;;\r\n- definition of a new combined test &quot;Check
    of operating system at maximum speed&quot;;\r\n- new Annex &quot;Static contact
    force tolerances in Japan&quot;."
