abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62565-3-6:2026 which is a Technical Specification, establishes
    the blank detail specification for graphene oxide in powders and aqueous dispersions.<br
    />\r\nThis document defines a format for specifying key control characteristics
    (KCCs), including a list of these characteristics and their corresponding standardized
    measurement procedures, where available. Numeric values are left blank to be determined
    between the customer and supplier in the detail specification (DS).<br />\r\nIn
    the DS, key control characteristics can be added or removed by mutual agreement.<br
    />\r\nIf no standardized measurement procedures are available, guidelines in Annex
    A are presented, which can be used by the involved parties to assure consistent
    material quality.<br />\r\nFor non-aqueous solvents, it is crucial to make modifications
    to address relevant characteristics such as appearance, pH, and viscosity."
