    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62769-7:2021
    specifies the elements implementing communication capabilities called Communication
    Devices (IEC 62769-5).<br />\r\nThe overall FDI architecture is illustrated in
    Figure 1. The architectural components that are within the scope of this document
    have been highlighted in this illustration. The document scope with respect to
    FDI Packages is limited to Communication Devices. The Communication Server shown
    in Figure 1 is an example of a specific Communication Device."
