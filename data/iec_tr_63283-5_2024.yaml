abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63283-5:2024 describes the market and innovation trend analysis
    affecting smart manufacturing (SM). The market and innovation trends will influence
    the evolution of smart manufacturing and it will be important to have good insights
    on these trends. Specific aspects of the market trends are the evolution of the
    business cases that is assumed to highlight new supplier chain models, new revenue
    streams, new customer services, and/or new customer segments.<br />\r\nThe document
    will address the following topics:<br />\r\n• Market watch: Identify the important,
    likely, and/or disruptive market trends (e.g. mass customization) from an end-to-end
    perspective, which impact smart manufacturing topics/aspects. This includes the
    end-user, producers, supply chain, regulators, etc.<br />\r\n• Business model
    watch: Identify the new business model trends from an end-to-end perspective,
    which impact smart manufacturing.<br />\r\n• Technological watch: Identify the
    important, likely, and/or disruptive innovations (AI chipsets, 6G, quantum computing,
    etc.) describing the impacted smart manufacturing topics/aspects; this topic will
    focus on those technologies that are still under development but is assumed to
    influence (or is assumed to be influenced by) smart manufacturing.<br />\r\nThere
    are many more new trends which are used in SM. In this document, only some frequently
    discussed trends are presented. Some technologies are considered to have priority
    according to their maturity.<br />\r\nThis work will focus on how they can be
    used in SM."
