  content: 'IEC/TR 61292-4:2014(E) which is a technical report, applies to all commercially
    available optical amplifiers (OAs), including optical fibre amplifiers (OFAs)
    using active fibres, as well as Raman amplifiers. Semiconductor optical amplifiers
    (SOAs) using semiconductor gain media are also included. This technical report
    provides a simple informative guideline on the threshold of high optical power
    that causes high-temperature damage of fibre. Also discussed is optical safety
    for manufacturers and users of optical amplifiers by reiterating substantial parts
    of existing standards and agreements on eye and skin safety. It is important to
    point out that the reader should always refer to the latest international standards
    and agreements because the technologies concerned are rapidly evolving. The present
    technical report will be frequently reviewed and will be updated by incorporating
    the results of various studies related to OAs and OA-supported optical systems
    in a timely manner. This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition,
    published in 2010, and constitutes a technical revision with updates reflecting
    new research in the subject area. Keywords: guideline on the threshold of high
    optical power, maximum permissible optical power, optical amplifiers, Raman amplifiers,
    semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs)'
