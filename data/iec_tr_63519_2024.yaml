abstract:
- content: "IEC TR 63519:2024 provides information on terminology and general concepts
    in the determination of measurement uncertainties (MU). It focuses on application
    aspects based on the example of IEC TC 85 (Measuring equipment for electrical
    and electromagnetic quantities) and shows the opportunities and implications for
    further use of measurement uncertainties.<br />\r\nMeasurement uncertainties are
    relevant for metrological compatibility and metrological traceability. Therefore,
    information on the role of measurement uncertainty in decisions or conformity
    assessments is given.<br />\r\nReferences to documents, standards and guidelines
    are made but only key results will be stated."
