abstract:
- content: ISO/TS 10974:2012 is applicable to implantable parts of active implantable
    medical devices (AIMDs) intended to be used in patients who might undergo a magnetic
    resonance scan in 1,5T, cylindrical bore, whole body MR scanners for imaging the
    hydrogen nucleus. The tests that are specified in ISO/TS 10974:2012 are type tests
    intended to be carried out on samples of a device to characterize interactions
    with the magnetic and electromagnetic fields associated with an MR scanner. ISO/TS
    10974:2012 contains test methods that are applicable to a broad class of AIMDs
    for the purpose of evaluating device operation against several hazards.
