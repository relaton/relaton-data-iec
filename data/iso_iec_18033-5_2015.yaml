abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18033-5:2015 specifies identity-based encryption mechanisms. For
    each mechanism the functional interface, the precise operation of the mechanism,
    and the ciphertext format are specified. However, conforming systems may use alternative
    formats for storing and transmitting ciphertexts.
