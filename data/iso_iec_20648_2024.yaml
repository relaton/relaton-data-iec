    line-height: 11.5pt;">This document details the requirements for use of the Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) protocol in conjunction with data storage technologies. The
    requirements set out in this document are intended to facilitate secure interoperability
    of storage clients and servers as well as non-storage technologies that may have
    similar interoperability needs.</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:
    12.0pt; text-align: justify; line-height: 11.5pt;">This document is relevant to
    anyone involved in owning, operating or using data storage devices. This includes
    senior managers, acquirers of storage products and service, and other non-technical
    managers or users, in addition to managers and administrators who have specific
    responsibilities for information security and/or storage security, storage operation,
    or who are responsible for an organization’s overall security program and security
    policy development. It is also relevant to anyone involved in the planning, design
    and implementation of the architectural aspects of storage security.</p>'
