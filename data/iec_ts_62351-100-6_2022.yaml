abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62351-100-6:2022 (E), which is a technical specification, is part
    of the IEC 62351 suite of standards, which describes test cases for interoperability
    conformance testing of data and communication security for Substation Automation
    Systems [SAS] and telecontrol systems which implement IEC TS 62351-6. The tests
    described in this part do not evaluate the security of the implementation. Thus,
    citing conformance to this part does not imply that any particular security level
    has been achieved by the corresponding product, or by the system in which it is
    used.<br />\r\nThe goal of this part of IEC 62351 is to enable interoperability
    by providing a standard method of testing protocol implementations, but it does
    not guarantee the full interoperability of devices. It is expected that using
    this specification during testing will minimize the risk of non-interoperability.
    Additional testing and assurance measures will be required to verify that a particular
    implementation of IEC TC 62351-6 has correctly implemented all the security functions
    and that they can be assured to be present in all delivered products. This topic
    is covered in other IEC standards, for example IEC 62443.<br />\r\nThe scope of
    this document is to specify common available procedures and definitions for conformance
    and/or interoperability testing of IEC 62351-6, the IEC 61850-8-1, IEC 61850-9-2
    and also their recommendations over IEC 62351-3 for profiles including TCP/IP
    and IEC 62351 4 for profiles including MMS. These are the security extensions
    for IEC 61850 and derivatives to enable unambiguous and standardized evaluation
    of IEC TS 62351-6 and its companion standards protocol implementations.<br />\r\nThe
    detailed test cases per companion standard, containing among others mandatory
    and optional mandatory test cases per Secure Communication Application Function,
    secure ASDU (Application Service Data Unit) and transmission procedures, will
    become available as technical specifications (TS). Other functionality may need
    additional test cases, but this is outside the scope of this part of IEC 62351.
    This document is such a technical specification for the mentioned companion standard.<br
    />\r\nThis document deals mainly with data and communication security conformance
    testing; therefore, other requirements, such as safety or EMC (Electromagnetic
    compatibility) are not covered. These requirements are covered by other standards
    (if applicable) and the proof of compliance for these topics is done according
    to these standards."
