abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    26300-2:2015 the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version
    1.2 specification. It defines a formula language for OpenDocument documents, which
    is also called OpenFormula. OpenFormula is a specification of an open format for
    exchanging recalculated formulas between office applications, in particular, formulas
    in spreadsheet documents. OpenFormula defines data types, syntax, and semantics
    for recalculated formulas, including predefined functions and operations. Using
    OpenFormula allows document creators to change the office application they use,
    exchange formulas with others (who may use a different application), and access
    formulas far in the future, with confidence that the recalculated formulas in
    their documents will produce equivalent results if given equivalent inputs. OpenFormula
    is intended to be a supporting document to the Open Document Format for Office
    Applications (OpenDocument) format, particularly for defining its attributes table:formula
    and text:formula. It can also be used in other circumstances where a simple, easy-to-read
    infix text notation is desired for exchanging recalculated formulas."
