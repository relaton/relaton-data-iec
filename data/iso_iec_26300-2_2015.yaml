abstract:
- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p>ISO/IEC 26300-2:2015 the Open Document
    Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) Version 1.2 specification. It defines
    a formula language for OpenDocument documents, which is also called OpenFormula.</p><p>OpenFormula
    is a specification of an open format for exchanging recalculated formulas between
    office applications, in particular, formulas in spreadsheet documents. OpenFormula
    defines data types, syntax, and semantics for recalculated formulas, including
    predefined functions and operations.</p><p>Using OpenFormula allows document creators
    to change the office application they use, exchange formulas with others (who
    may use a different application), and access formulas far in the future, with
    confidence that the recalculated formulas in their documents will produce equivalent
    results if given equivalent inputs.</p><p>OpenFormula is intended to be a supporting
    document to the Open Document Format for Office Applications (OpenDocument) format,
    particularly for defining its attributes table:formula and text:formula. It can
    also be used in other circumstances where a simple, easy-to-read infix text notation
    is desired for exchanging recalculated formulas.</p>
