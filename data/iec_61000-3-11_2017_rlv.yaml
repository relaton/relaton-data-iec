    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61000-3-11:2017
    is concerned with the emission of voltage changes, voltage fluctuations and flicker
    produced by equipment and impressed on the public low-voltage supply system. It
    specifies the limits of voltage changes produced by equipment tested under specified
    conditions.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na) addition of a new Annex
    A which explains the limitations and effectiveness of IEC 61000‑3-11 regarding
    the connection of multiple items of similar equipment at the same location in
    the supply network."
