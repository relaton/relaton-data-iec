abstract:
- content: <p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document provides requirements and guidance
    on the implementation of DevOps to define, control, and improve software life
    cycle processes. It applies within an organization or a project to build, package,
    and deploy software and systems in a secure and reliable way. This document specifies
    practices to collaborate and communicate effectively in groups including development,
    operations, and other key stakeholders.</p><p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document
    applies a common framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined
    terminology. It contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied
    to the full life cycle of software systems, products, and services, including
    conception, development, production, utilization, support, and retirement. It
    also applies to the acquisition and supply of software systems, whether performed
    internally or externally to an organization. These life cycle processes are accomplished
    through the involvement of stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer
    satisfaction. The life cycle processes of this document can be applied concurrently,
    iteratively, and recursively to a software system and incrementally to its elements.</p><p
    class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document applies to software systems, products,
    and services, and the software portion of any system. Software includes the software
    portion of firmware. Those aspects of system definition needed to provide the
    context for software systems, products, and services are included.</p><p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">There
    is a wide variety of software systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application,
    complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans, and
    evolution. This document describes the processes that comprise the life cycle
    of software systems. It therefore applies to one-of-a-kind software systems, software
    systems for wide commercial or public distribution, and customized, adaptable
    software systems. It also applies to a complete stand-alone software system and
    to software systems that are embedded and integrated into larger, more complex,
    and complete systems.</p>
