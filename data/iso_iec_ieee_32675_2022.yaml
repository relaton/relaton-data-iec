- content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br /><p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This
    document provides requirements and guidance on the implementation of DevOps to
    define, control, and improve software life cycle processes. It applies within
    an organization or a project to build, package, and deploy software and systems
    in a secure and reliable way. This document specifies practices to collaborate
    and communicate effectively in groups including development, operations, and other
    key stakeholders.</p><p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document applies a common
    framework for software life cycle processes, with well-defined terminology. It
    contains processes, activities, and tasks that are to be applied to the full life
    cycle of software systems, products, and services, including conception, development,
    production, utilization, support, and retirement. It also applies to the acquisition
    and supply of software systems, whether performed internally or externally to
    an organization. These life cycle processes are accomplished through the involvement
    of stakeholders, with the ultimate goal of achieving customer satisfaction. The
    life cycle processes of this document can be applied concurrently, iteratively,
    and recursively to a software system and incrementally to its elements.</p><p
    class="IEEEStdsParagraph">This document applies to software systems, products,
    and services, and the software portion of any system. Software includes the software
    portion of firmware. Those aspects of system definition needed to provide the
    context for software systems, products, and services are included.</p><p class="IEEEStdsParagraph">There
    is a wide variety of software systems in terms of their purpose, domain of application,
    complexity, size, novelty, adaptability, quantities, locations, life spans, and
    evolution. This document describes the processes that comprise the life cycle
    of software systems. It therefore applies to one-of-a-kind software systems, software
    systems for wide commercial or public distribution, and customized, adaptable
    software systems. It also applies to a complete stand-alone software system and
    to software systems that are embedded and integrated into larger, more complex,
    and complete systems.</p>
