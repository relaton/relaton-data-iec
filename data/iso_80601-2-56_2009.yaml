abstract:
- content: ISO 80601-2-56:2009 applies to the basic safety and essential performance
    of a clinical thermometer in combination with its accessories, referred to as
    ME equipment. ISO 80601-2-56:2009 specifies the general and technical requirements
    for electrical clinical thermometers. ISO 80601-2-56:2009 applies to all electrical
    clinical thermometers that are used for measuring the body temperature of patients.
    Clinical thermometers can be equipped with interfaces to accommodate secondary
    indicators, printing equipment, and other auxiliary equipment to create ME systems.
    ISO 80601-2-56:2009 does not apply to auxiliary equipment. ME equipment that measures
    a temperature not as a primary purpose, but as a secondary function, is outside
    the scope of ISO 80601-2-56:2009. Requirements for ME equipment intended to be
    used for non-invasive human febrile temperature screening of groups of individuals
    under indoor environmental conditions are given in IEC 80601-2-59:2008 and such
    ME equipment is not covered by ISO 80601-2-56:2009.
