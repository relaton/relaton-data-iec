  content: "IEC TS 62607-6-7:2023 establishes a method to determine the key control
    characteristics sheet resistance RS [measured in ohm per square (Ω/sq)], by the
    van der Pauw method, vdP.<br />\r\nThe sheet resistance RS is derived by measurements
    of four-terminal electrical resistance performed on four electrical contacts placed
    on the boundary of the planar sample and calculated with a mathematical expression
    involving the two resistance measurements.<br />\r\nThe measurement range for
    RS of the graphene samples with the method described in this document goes from
    10−2 Ω/sq to 104 Ω/sq.<br />\r\nThe method is applicable for CVD graphene provided
    it is transferred to quartz substrates or other insulating materials (quartz,
    SiO2 on Si), as well as graphene grown from silicon carbide.<br />\r\nThe method
    is complementary to the in-line four-point-probe method (4PP, IEC 62607-6-8) for
    what concerns the measurement of the sheet resistance and can be applied when
    it is possible to reliably place contacts on the sample boundary, avoiding the
    sample being scratched by the 4PP.<br />\r\nThe outcome of the van der Pauw method
    is independent of the contact position provided the sample is uniform, which is
    typically not true for graphene at this stage. This document considers the case
    of samples with non-strictly uniform conductivity distribution and suggests a
    way to consider the sample inhomogeneity as a component of the uncertainty on
    RS."
