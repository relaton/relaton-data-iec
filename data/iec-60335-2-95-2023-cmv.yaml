  content: "IEC 60335-2-95:2023 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 60335-2-95:2023 edition 5.0 and the previous IEC 60335-2-95:2019
    edition 4.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 61 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60335-2-95:2023 deals with the safety of electric drives for
    garage doors for residential use that open and close in a vertical direction,
    the rated voltage of the drives being not more than 250 V for single-phase appliances
    and 480 V for other appliances, including direct current (DC) supplied appliances
    and battery-operated appliances. It also covers the hazards associated with the
    movement of these electrically driven garage doors.<br />\r\nThe drive can be
    supplied with a garage door.<br />\r\nThis standard also applies to entrapment
    protection devices for use with drives. It does not cover hazards related to the
    mechanisms of the door itself.<br />\r\nAs far as is practicable, this standard
    deals with the common hazards presented by appliances that are encountered by
    all persons in and around the home. However, in general, it does not take into
    account playing with the appliance by young children, but recognizes that children
    can be in the vicinity of the garage door.<br />\r\nFor appliances intended to
    be used in vehicles or on board ships or aircraft, additional requirements can
    be necessary. In many countries, additional requirements are specified by the
    national health authorities, the national authorities responsible for the protection
    of labour, the national water supply authorities and similar authorities.<br />\r\nThis
    standard does not apply to drives<br />\r\n– for shutters, awnings, blinds and
    similar equipment (IEC 60335-2-97);<br />\r\n– for gates, doors and windows (IEC
    60335-2-103);<br />\r\n– for commercial and industrial purposes;<br />\r\n– intended
    to be used in locations where special conditions prevail, such as the presence
    of a corrosive or explosive atmosphere (dust, vapour or gas).<br />\r\nThis fifth
    edition cancels and replaces the fourth edition published in 2019. This edition
    constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis edition includes the following
    significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\na)
    the text has been aligned with IEC 60335-1:2020;<br />\r\nb) scope includes DC-supplied
    appliances and battery-operated appliances (Clause 1);<br />\r\nc) some notes
    have been converted to normative text (Clause 1, 7.12.1, 7.101, 20.103, 20.107,
    22.104);<br />\r\nd) application of test probe 19 has been introduced (8.1.1,
    20.2);<br />\r\ne) addition of surface temperatures for external accessible surfaces
    (11.3, 11.8);<br />\r\nf) requirements are added for drives intended for permanent
    connection delivered with a connector to ease the installation (22.110, 24.1.101,
    25.3);<br />\r\ng) clarification for connectors that are non-detachable once engaged
    (24.1.5).<br />\r\nThis part 2 is to be used in conjunction with the latest edition
    of IEC 60335-1 and its amendments unless that edition precludes it; in that case,
    the latest edition that does not preclude it is used. It was established on the
    basis of the sixth edition (2020) of that standard."
