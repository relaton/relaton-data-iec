abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC 29341-4-11:2011(E) describes the service-type which enables modeling
    of streaming capabilities of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between
    devices. Each device that is able to send or receive a stream according to the
    UPnP AV Architecture will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This
    service provides a mechanism for control points to:<br/> \na) Perform capability
    matching between source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,<br/> \nb) Find
    information about currently ongoing transfers in the network,<br/> \nc) Setup
    and teardown connections between devices (when required by the streaming protocol).<br/>
    \nThis service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version
    1.0. This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-11, first edition, published
    in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision."
