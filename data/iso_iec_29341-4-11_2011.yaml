abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-4-11:2011 describes the service-type which enables modeling of streaming
    capabilities of A/V devices, and binding of those capabilities between devices.
    Each device that is able to send or receive a stream according to the UPnP AV
    Architecture will have 1 instance of the ConnectionManager service. This service
    provides a mechanism for control points to:<br />\r\na) Perform capability matching
    between source/server devices and sink/renderer devices,<br />\r\nb) Find information
    about currently ongoing transfers in the network,<br />\r\nc) Setup and teardown
    connections between devices (when required by the streaming protocol).<br />\r\nThis
    service definition is compliant with the UPnP Device Architecture version 1.0.
    This International Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-4-11, first edition, published
    in 2008, and constitutes a technical revision."
