  content: "IEC 60317-36:2013+AMD1:2019+AMD2:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of
    solderable enamelled round copper winding wire of class 180 with a dual coating.
    The underlying coating is based on polyesterimide resin, which may be modified
    providing it retains the chemical identity of the original resin and meets all
    specified wire requirements. The superimposed coating is a bonding layer based
    on a thermoplastic resin.<br />\r\nNOTE - A modified resin is a resin that has
    undergone a chemical change, or contains one or more additives to enhance certain
    performance or application characteristics. The range of nominal conductor diameters
    covered by this part is:<br />\r\n- Grade 1B: 0,020 mm up to and including 1,600
    mm;<br />\r\n- Grade 2B: 0,020 mm up to and including 1,600 mm. The nominal conductor
    diameters are specified in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 1992, Amendment 1:1997 and
    Amendment 2:1999. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition:<br />\r\n- new 3.2.2 containing general notes on winding wire, formerly
    a part of the scope;<br />\r\n- revision to references to IEC 60317-0-1:2013 to
    clarify that their application is normative;<br />\r\n- consolidation of 17.1
    and 17.2 of the solderability requirements;<br />\r\n- new Clause 23, Pin hole
    test.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nKeywords: requirements of solderable enamelled round
    copper winding wire, class 180, dual coating"
