    components. This document identifies safety, security, privacy, and other requirements
    for AAL systems such as usability, accessibility, and trustworthiness (reliability,
    resilience) and sets up a process to identify the needs on the body area network
    (BAN), edge and cloud computing in the architecture perspective.<br />\r\nIEC
    63240-1:2024 cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2020. This edition
