abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    7501-1:2008 is intended for use in all applications relating to machine readable
    passports (MRPs). It specifies the form and provides guidance on the construction
    of MRPs, in particular in relation to those aspects of the MRP where details of
    the rightful holder are presented in a form which is both visual and machine readable.
    It equally defines the specifications to be used by States wishing to issue an
    electronically enabled version of the MRP (ePassport) for secure carriage and
    access to an expanded set of details, including globally interoperable biometric
    data for confirming the presenter as the rightful holder of the ePassport."
