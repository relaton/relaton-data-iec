abstract:
- content: "This document specifies:<br />\r\n1) Constructs for representing and specifying
    various augmentation and presentation styles. While augmentations can be in modalities
    other than the visual (e.g. aural, haptic), this work addresses the visual augmentation
    style only.<br />\r\n2) A model for how to associate the stylization constructs
    to the augmentation objects. Specifically, the MAR behavior object in ISO/IEC
    3721 is extended for this purpose.<br />\r\n3) Other miscellaneous functionalities
    and abstractions that support the stylization of augmentation objects."
