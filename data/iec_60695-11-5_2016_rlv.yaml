abstract:
- content: "IEC 60695-11-5:2016 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 60695-11-5:2016
    specifies a needle-flame test to simulate the effect of a small flame which may
    result from fault conditions, in order to assess the fire hazard by a simulation
    technique. The results of this test may be used as elements of a fire hazard assessment
    which takes into account all of the factors which are pertinent to an assessment
    of the fire hazard of a particular end use. It is applicable to electrotechnical
    equipment, its sub-assemblies and components and to solid electrical insulating
    materials or other combustible materials. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- The scope has been broadened to allow this
    test method to also simulate the effects of small flames from outside the equipment;<br
    />\r\n- Propane and butane gas are the specified fuel source with a minimum purity
    of 95 %;<br />\r\n- A new concept has been added which allows the burner to be
    moved during the test to avoid dripping material from falling onto the tip of
    the burner tube;<br />\r\n- The burner tube material is now a referenced source;<br
    />\r\n- The reference for the copper block material has changed - the ISO publication
    (ISO 1337) has been withdrawn with no replacement. A new callout is now used and
    Informative Annex C and a bibliography have been added. This basic safety publication
    is intended for use by technical committees in the preparation of standards in
    accordance with the principles laid down in IEC Guide 104 and ISO/IEC Guide 51."
