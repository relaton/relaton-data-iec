    <p>This document specifies how the format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 can be used to store web resources (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.) and defines brands to identify files conforming to this document. It also specifies hypothetical processing for how these files can be consumed by web browsers.</p>
    <p>The specified storage enables the delivery of synchronized media and web resources as supported by ISO/IEC 14496-12: file download, progressive file download, streaming, broadcast, etc.</p>
    <p>This document also defines how to signal required web capabilities to process the files. This is done in a way that web profiles defined by other organizations can be signalled in a dedicated box, e.g. the MIME Box, similarly to how it is done in ISO/IEC 14496-30.</p>
    <p>This document does not define any profiles for web data, only their carriage.</p>
