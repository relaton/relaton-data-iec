abstract:
- content: IEC 61588:2009(E) defines a protocol enabling precise synchronization of
    clocks in measurement and control systems implemented with technologies such as
    network communication, local computing, and distributed objects. The protocol
    is applicable to systems communicating by local area networks supporting multicast
    messaging including, but not limited to, Ethernet. The protocol enables heterogeneous
    systems that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability
    to synchronize to a grandmaster clock. The protocol supports system-wide synchronization
    accuracy in the sub-microsecond range with minimal network and local clock computing
    resources. The default behavior of the protocol allows simple systems to be installed
    and operated without requiring the administrative attention of users. The standard
    includes mappings to User Datagram Protocol (UDP)/Internet Protocol (IP), DeviceNet,
    and a layer-2 Ethernet implementation. It includes formal mechanisms for message
    extensions, higher sampling rates, correction for asymmetry, a clock type to reduce
    error accumulation in large topologies, and specifications on how to incorporate
    the resulting additional data into the synchronization protocol. This second edition
    cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2004. It constitutes a technical
    revision.
