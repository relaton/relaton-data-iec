abstract:
- content: "IEC 62902:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62902:2025
    specifies methods for the clear identification of secondary cells, batteries,
    battery modules and monoblocs according to their chemistry (electrochemical storage
    technology).<br />\r\nThe markings described in this document are applicable to<br
    />\r\n- secondary cells,<br />\r\n- batteries,<br />\r\n- battery modules, and<br
    />\r\n- monoblocs,<br />\r\nwhen they are placed on the market for end use and
    when their battery volume exceeds 900 cm3.<br />\r\nThe chemistry marking is useful
    for the installation, operation and decommissioning phases in the battery's life
    cycle.<br />\r\nThis document defines the conditions of use of the markings indicating
    the chemistry of these secondary batteries."
