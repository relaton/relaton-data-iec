  content: "IEC 61557-11:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 61557-11:2020
    specifies the requirements for test equipment applied to the testing of the effectiveness
    of residual current monitors (RCM) that are already installed in distribution
    systems. This test equipment can be used in any kind of network, such as a TN,
    TT or IT system. The test equipment can also be used for testing directionally
    discriminating residual current monitors (RCM) in IT systems. It is not the purpose
    of this document to verify the residual current monitors (RCM) according to their
    product standards. IEC 61557-11:2020 cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This edition includes
    the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous edition:<br
    />\r\na) document title modified to include all types of RCM;<br />\r\nb) terms
    aligned with IEC 60050;<br />\r\nc) addition of requirements for testing new types
    of RCM;<br />\r\nd) moving of requirements for RCM Type B from former Annex A
    to main body text;<br />\r\ne) alignment of the structure with that of the whole
    IEC 61557 series."
