  content: "IEC TR 60825-14:2022 This second edition cancels and replaces the first
    edition published in 2004. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\nincorporates changes made in IEC 60825-1:2014;<br />\r\nadds
    information to users of laser equipment on administrative controls to ensure safety
    in the workplace, including the training and appointment of people to specific
    laser safety management roles;<br />\r\nupdates an approach to risk assessment;<br
    />\r\nincludes updated guidance on the management of incidents and accidents;<br
    />\r\nincludes updated guidance on medical surveillance for laser workers;<br
    />\r\nincludes revised examples of calculations.<br />\r\nThis document is intended
    to help laser users and their employers to understand the general principles of
    safety management, to identify the hazards that can be present, to assess the
    risks of harm that can arise, and to set up and maintain appropriate control measures.
    Although the guidance given in this document is aimed principally at organizations
    (whether private, corporate or public), where systems of safety management would
    be expected to be in place, it can be applied by anyone using lasers.<br />\r\nLaser
    control measures vary widely. They depend on the type of laser equipment in use,
    the task or process being performed, the environment in which the equipment is
    used and the personnel who are at risk of harm. Specific requirements for certain
    laser applications are given in other documents in the IEC 60825 series."
