abstract:
- content: IEC/TR 62617:2010(E) applies to uncertainty reporting of home laundry electrical
    appliances. It allows to estimate the uncertainty of a measured result and to
    predict the range of values that may be measured when the same appliance is measured
    in another laboratory following the same measurement method.
