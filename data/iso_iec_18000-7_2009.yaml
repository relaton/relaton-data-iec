abstract:
- content: ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the air interface for radio frequency identification
    (RFID) devices operating as an active RF tag in the 433 MHz band used in item
    management applications. It provides a common technical specification for RFID
    devices that can be used by ISO technical committees developing RFID application
    standards. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 is intended to allow for compatibility and to
    encourage inter-operability of products for the growing RFID market in the international
    marketplace. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 defines the forward and return link parameters
    for technical attributes including, but not limited to, operating frequency, operating
    channel accuracy, occupied channel bandwidth, maximum power, spurious emissions,
    modulation, duty cycle, data coding, bit rate, bit rate accuracy, bit transmission
    order, and, where appropriate, operating channels, frequency hop rate, hop sequence,
    spreading sequence, and chip rate. ISO/IEC 18000-7:2009 further defines the communications
    protocol used in the air interface.
