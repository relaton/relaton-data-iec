abstract:
- content: "IEC 60401-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<p>IEC 60401-1:2020 provides a
    nomenclature of the most frequent surface, bulk and shape irregularities relevant
    to cores made of soft ferrites (magnetic oxides). Most irregularities are graphically
    exemplified as visual aids. A general recommendation is also given in Annex A
    for a consistent scheme for specifying the exact location of the irregularity,
    combining a general name for the location with more detailed qualifiers of the
    specified location. This document can also be useful as a terminology reference
    when preparing technical documentation, irregularity inspection specifications,
    etc. This document also presents a method for defining the designation nomenclature
    for the major physical attributes of soft ferrite core shapes. The purpose of
    this document is to facilitate uniform usage of dimensional characters by manufacturers,
    specifiers, and users when describing core dimensions on drawings, in tables,
    and on catalogue specification sheets. This second edition cancels and replaces
    the first edition of IEC 60401-1 published in 2002 and the second edition of IEC
    60401-2 published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision. This
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous editions of IEC 60401-1 and IEC 60401-2:<br />\r\n- added the surface
    irregularity term “pores” in 4.3.1.6;<br />\r\n- added the surface irregularity
    term “scratch” in 4.3.6.3;<br />\r\n- removed the surface irregularity term “crater”
    in 4.1.5 of IEC 60401-1: 2002;<br />\r\n- removed the bulk irregularity terms
    “superpores” in 5.1, “inclusions” in 5.2, “internal stratification” in 5.3 and
    “internal crack” in 5.4 of IEC 60401-1: 2002;<br />\r\n- removed the contents
    related to “yoke ring cores” in 7.1.3 and 7.4 of IEC 60401-1:2002;<br />\r\n-
    replaced the surface irregularity term “stratification” with “lamination” in 4.3.4.7;<br
    />\r\n- replaced the location related terms “upper surface of back” with “bottom
    surface” and “lower surface of back” with “back surface” in Figure A.1;<br />\r\n-
    changed Clause 7 of IEC 60401-1:2002 into Annex A.</p>"
