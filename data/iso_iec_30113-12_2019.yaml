abstract:
- content: "<p>This document defines multi-point gestures for common system actions
    used in information and communication technology (ICT) systems.</p><p>It specifies
    movements and conditions for describing multi-point gestures recognized by the
    systems and applications. The multi-point gestures are performed using an input
    device (multi-touchpad, multi-touchscreen, etc.) or body parts (fingertips, hands,
    etc.). These multi-point gestures are intended to operate in a consistent manner
    regardless of systems, platforms or applications.</p><p>The gestures for common
    system actions denote system-level functions and common functions across applications
    of ICT systems. The system-level functions are executed at a system or a platform
    level. They include initiation, resume, restart and termination, etc. The common
    functions across applications are commonly executed among applications of a system
    or a platform. The functions include navigation of menus, opening an object, closing
    an object, etc.</p><p>NOTE ICT systems include, but are not limited to, digital
    televisions, set-top boxes, video game consoles, communication devices, internet
    devices, entertainment devices, and personal computers (PCs).</p>"
