abstract:
- content: "IEC 62453-302:2023 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62453-302:2023
    provides information for integrating the CIP™ technology into the FDT interface
    specification (IEC 62453‑2). Communication Profile Family 2 (commonly known as
    CIP™[1]) defines communication profiles based on IEC 61158-2 Type 2, IEC 61158-3-2,
    IEC 61158-4-2, IEC 61158-5-2, IEC 61158-6-2, and IEC 62026-3. The basic profiles
    CP 2/1 (ControlNet™[2]), CP 2/2 (EtherNet/IP™[3]), and CP 2/3 (DeviceNet™1) are
    defined in IEC 61784‑1 and IEC 61784‑2. An additional communication profile (CompoNet™1),
    also based on CIP™, is defined in IEC 62026-7. This part of IEC 62453 specifies
    communication and other services. This specification neither contains the FDT
    specification nor modifies it.<br /><br />\r\n[1] CIP™ (Common Industrial Protocol),
    DeviceNet™ and CompoNet™ are trade names of Open DeviceNet Vendor Association,
    Inc (ODVA). This information is given for the convenience of users of this document
