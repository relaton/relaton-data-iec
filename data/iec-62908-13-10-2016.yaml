  content: IEC 62908-13-10:2016(E) specifies the methods for testing the environmental
    durability of touch display modules, touch sensor modules and test pattern cells,
    and can be used for devices at the production level, the prototype level or the
    trial model level when they are exposed to environmental stress. This document
    is applicable for touch displays that use capacitive or resistive detection sensors.
    It may also be applicable to other types of sensors as well as to touch display
    modules with both flat and flexible displays.
