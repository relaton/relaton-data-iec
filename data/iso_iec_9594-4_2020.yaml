abstract:
- content: "<p>This document specifies the behaviour of DSAs taking part in a distributed
    directory consisting of multiple Directory systems agents (DSAs) and/or LDAP servers
    with at least one DSA. The allowed behaviour has been designed to ensure a consistent
    service given a wide distribution of the DIB across a distributed directory. Only
    the behaviour of DSAs taking part in a distributed directory is specified. The
    behaviour of LDAP servers are specified in relevant LDAP specifications. There
    are no special requirements on an LDAP server beyond those given by the LDAP specifications.</p><p>The
    Directory is not intended to be a general purpose database system, although it
    may be built on such systems. It is assumed that there is a considerably higher
    frequency of queries than of updates.</p>"
