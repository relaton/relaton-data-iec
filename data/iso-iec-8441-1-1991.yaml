    <p>This part of ISO/IEC 8441 specifies requirements for</p>
    <p>unrecorded magnetic tape designed for high density</p>
    <p>digital recording (HDDR) having the following</p>
    <p>characteristics:</p>

    <p>a)     nominal thickness 25,4 urn (0,001 in);</p>

    <p>b)     longitudinal magnetic orientation;</p>

    <p>c)     coercivity 72 kA/m (900 Oe) max.</p>

    <p>These tapes are suitable for interchange in accordance</p>
    <p>with ISO/IEC 8441-2.</p>

    <p>Requirements for packaging are also included.</p>

    <p>NOTE 1 Tapes of coercivity above 32 kA/m (400 Oe) are</p>
    <p>usually classified as high energy tapes and users should</p>
    <p>establish compatibility with equipment used for driving</p>
    <p>them.</p>

    <p>Annex A gives guidance on glass and metal-flanged</p>
    <p>reels. Annex B gives information on the wear of recording</p>
    <p>heads. Different categories of environmental</p>
    <p>conditions and their effects on tape are dealt with in</p>
    <p>annex C. Severe operating conditions are considered</p>
    <p>in annex D. Surface electrical resistance</p>
    <p>testing is dealt with in annex E. A tape abrasivity</p>
    <p>testing technique is described in annex F. A list of</p>
    <p>bibliographical references is given in annex G.</p>

    <p>NOTES</p>
    <p>2 It is recognized that archival interchange tapes, or</p>
    <p>those produced by systems in use prior to the publication</p>
    <p>of this part of ISO/lEC 8441, may not comply with the requirements</p>
    <p>and/or recommendations herein.</p>
    <p>3 Various tests and procedures herein refer to recording</p>
    <p>with a.c. HF bias. In practice, certain HDDR systems do</p>
    <p>not use bias. The use of bias in this part of ISO/IEC 8441</p>
    <p>does not imply that the tape so tested is in any way unsuitable</p>
    <p>for a biasless system.</p>
