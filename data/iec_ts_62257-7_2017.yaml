abstract:
- content: "<!-- NEW -->IEC TS 62257-7:2017 is also available as IEC TS 62257-7:2017
    RLV which contains the International Standard and its Redline version, showing
    all changes of the technical content compared to the previous edition.<br /><br
    />\r\nIEC TS 62257-7:2017 specifies the general requirements for the generators
    in decentralized rural electrification systems. This document is a general introduction
    followed by more specific documents dedicated to the generation technologies which
    are the most currently used in rural electrification projects. This new edition
    includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the previous
    edition: removed the word \"small\" from the description of the PV systems, and
    removed the power limit (100 kVA); increased the relevant voltage levels to 1
    000 V (AC) and 1 500 V (DC)."
