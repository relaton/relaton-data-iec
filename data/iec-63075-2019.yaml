  content: "IEC 63075:2019 specifies test methods and requirements for high-temperature
    superconducting (HTS) AC power cable systems, cables and their accessories, for
    fixed installations, for rated voltages from 6 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 7,2
    kV) up to and including 500 kV (<em>U</em><sub>m</sub> = 550 kV).<br />\r\nThe
    requirements apply to single-core, three-core and three-phase concentric cables
    with cold dielectric and their accessories that are not intended for fault current
    limitation purposes.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover special cables and
    their accessories, such as fault current limiting cables or submarine cables,
    for which modifications to the standard tests may be necessary or special test
    conditions may need to be devised.<br />\r\nThis document does not cover test
    methods and requirements for the cooling system."
