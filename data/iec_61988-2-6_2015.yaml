abstract:
- content: IEC 61988-2-6:2015(E) defines the measuring methods for gamma and colour
    gamut characteristics as a function of the APL for a PDP module (plasma display
    module). Generally, the luminance level of a PDP module is dependent on the APL
    (average picture level) of input images. Varying the input levels causes a change
    of the chromaticity of RGB primary colours. This standard also defines the measuring
    methods of tone characteristics and chromaticity characteristics with varying
    APLs. This standard is based on the assumption that the inverse-gamma circuit
    is inside the module.
