  content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 14543-4-1:2008(E) specifies the services and protocol of the
    application layer for usage in Home Electronic Systems (HES). It provides the
    services and the interface to the user process. Some services are targeted to
    field level communication between devices. Other services are exclusively reserved
    for management purposes. Some services can be used for both management and run-time
    communication. This International Standard is based on ECHONET.
