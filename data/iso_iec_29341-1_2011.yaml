abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29341-1:2011 Defines UPnP technology which describes an architecture for pervasive
    peer-to-peer network connectivity of intelligent appliances, wireless devices,
    and PCs of all form factors. It is designed to bring easy-to-use, flexible, standards-based
    connectivity to ad-hoc or unmanaged networks whether in the home, in a small business,
    public spaces, or attached to the Internet. UPnP technology provides a distributed,
    open networking architecture that leverages TCP/IP and the Web technologies to
    enable seamless proximity networking in addition to control and data transfer
    among networked devices. The UPnP Device Architecture (UDA) is designed to support
    zero-configuration, \"invisible\" networking, and automatic discovery for a breadth
    of device categories from a wide range of vendors. A device can dynamically join
    a network, obtain an IP address, convey its capabilities, and learn about the
    presence and capabilities of other devices. Finally, a device can leave a network
    smoothly and automatically without leaving any unwanted state behind. The technologies
    leveraged in the UPnP architecture include Internet protocols such as IP, TCP,
    UDP, HTTP, and XML. Like the Internet, contracts are based on wire protocols that
    are declarative, expressed in XML, and communicated via HTTP. This International
    Standard replaces ISO/IEC 29341-1, first edition, published in 2008, and constitutes
    a technical revision."
