  content: IEC/TS 62610-3:2009(E) provides an evaluation method for thermoelectrical
    cooling systems (Peltier effect). With this design guide it is possible to calculate
    the efficiency of the thermoelectrical cooling system (Peltier effect) and its
    cooling power depending on the ambient temperature and internal temperature. This
    design guide can also be used to appraise thermoelectrical cooling systems by
    its efficiency.
