abstract:
- content: "<p>ISO/IEC 15050:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support
    of the Advice Of Charge supplementary services (SS-AOC) at the Q reference point
    between Private Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together
    within a Private Integrated Services Network (PISN).</p><p>SS-AOC is a set of
    supplementary services which enable a user to receive information about the charging
    of its calls that leave the PISN and enter another network.</p><p>The three AOC
    supplementary services are:</p><ol><li>Charging information at call set-up time
    (AOC-S): SS-AOC-S enables the user to receive information about the charging rates
    at call set-up time and also to receive further information during the call if
    there is a change of charging rates.</li><li>Charging information during the call
    (AOC-D): SS-AOC-D enables a user to receive information on the recorded charges
    for a call during the active phase of the call.</li><li>Charging information at
    the end of the call (AOC-E): SS-AOC-E enables a user to receive information on
    the recorded charges for a call when the call is terminated.</li></ol><p>The Q
    reference point is defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1.</p>"
