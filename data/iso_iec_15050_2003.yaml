abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    15050:2003 specifies the signalling protocol for the support of the Advice Of
    Charge supplementary services (SS-AOC) at the Q reference point between Private
    Integrated services Network eXchanges (PINX) connected together within a Private
    Integrated Services Network (PISN).<br />\r\nSS-AOC is a set of supplementary
    services which enable a user to receive information about the charging of its
    calls that leave the PISN and enter another network.<br />\r\nThe three AOC supplementary
    services are:\r\n\r\n\tCharging information at call set-up time (AOC-S): SS-AOC-S
    enables the user to receive information about the charging rates at call set-up
    time and also to receive further information during the call if there is a change
    of charging rates.\r\n\tCharging information during the call (AOC-D): SS-AOC-D
    enables a user to receive information on the recorded charges for a call during
    the active phase of the call.\r\n\tCharging information at the end of the call
    (AOC-E): SS-AOC-E enables a user to receive information on the recorded charges
    for a call when the call is terminated.\r\n\r\nThe Q reference point is defined
    in ISO/IEC 11579-1."
