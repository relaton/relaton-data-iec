abstract:
- content: IEC 62481-6-2:2017(E) specifies guidelines for RVU which is a remote user
    interface (RUI) protocol that allows clients to present a full-featured user interface
    by implementing minimal functionality, leaving most of the processing to the server.
    The RVU RUI delivers bitmapped and/or vector graphic user interface data for a
    robust, consistent UI experience throughout the home via thin clients.
