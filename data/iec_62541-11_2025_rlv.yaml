abstract:
- content: "IEC 62541-11:2025 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 62541-11: 2025
    defines the Information Model associated with Historical Access (HA). It particularly
    includes additional and complementary descriptions of the NodeClasses and Attributes
    needed for Historical Access, additional standard Properties, and other information
    and behaviour. The complete AddressSpace Model including all NodeClasses and Attributes
    is specified in IEC 62541‑3. The predefined Information Model is defined in IEC
    62541‑5. The Services to detect and access historical data and events, and description
    of the ExtensibleParameter types are specified in IEC 62541‑4. This document includes
    functionality to compute and return Aggregates like minimum, maximum, average
    etc. The Information Model and the concrete working of Aggregates are defined
    in IEC 62541‑13. Conventions for Historical Access Clients are informatively provided
    in Annex A.<br />\r\nThis fourth edition cancels and replaces the third edition
    published in 2020. This edition constitutes a technical revision.<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) a functionality has been added to support retrieving
    of modified events;<br />\r\nb) an Event has been added to indicate when a backfill
    occurred;<br />\r\nc) a new ReferenceType that can be used to indicate an external
    node has been defined;<br />\r\nd) the text has been improved to better explain
    the concept of annotation and remove conflicting explanations;<br />\r\ne) a default
    historian configuration (and where to find it) has been defined;<br />\r\nf) HistoricalEventConfigurationType,
    which provides general configuration information about the historical Event storage,
    has been added;<br />\r\ng) the text has been updated and optional fields have
    been added to HA configuration object to allow configuration to be defined for
    periodic data collection, not just for exception-based collection;<br />\r\nh)
    an ObjectType that can be used for external event collection has been provided
    as well as an example how historians can be configured."
