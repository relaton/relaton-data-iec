abstract:
- content: "CISPR/TR 16-4-1:2009 gives guidance on the treatment of uncertainties
    to those who are involved in the development or modification of CISPR electromagnetic
    compatibility (EMC) standards. In addition, this part provides useful background
    information for those who apply the standards and the uncertainty aspects in practice.
    The objectives of this part are to:<br />\r\na) identify the parameters or sources
    governing the uncertainty associated with the statement that a given product complies
    with the requirement specified in a CISPR recommendation. This uncertainty will
    be called \"standards compliance uncertainty\";<br />\r\nb) give guidance on the
    estimation of the magnitude of the standards compliance uncertainty;<br />\r\nc)
    give guidance for the implementation of the standards compliance uncertainty into
    the compliance criterion of a CISPR standardised compliance test.<br />\r\nAs
    such, this part can be considered as a handbook that can be used by standards
    writers to incorporate and harmonise uncertainty considerations in existing and
    future CISPR standards. This part also gives guidance to regulatory authorities,
    accreditation bodies and test engineers to judge the performance quality of an
    EMC test-laboratory carrying out CISPR standardised compliance tests. The uncertainty
    considerations given in this part can also be used as guidance when comparing
    test results (and their uncertainties) obtained by using different alternative
    test methods. The uncertainty of a compliance test also relates to the probability
    of occurrence of an electromagnetic interference (EMI) problem in practice. This
    aspect is recognized and introduced briefly in this part. However, the problem
    of relating uncertainties of a compliance test to the occurrence of EMI in practice
    is not considered within the scope of this part. The scope of this part is limited
    to all the relevant uncertainty considerations of a standardized EMC compliance
    test. This second edition of CISPR 16-4-1 cancels and replaces the first edition
    published in 2003, and its Amendments 1 (2004) and 2 (2007). It constitutes a
    technical revision. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition. The provisions available for application
    of uncertainties in the determination of the compliance criterion are explained
    more generally and a procedure is added for re-testing an approved EUT by another
    test house."
