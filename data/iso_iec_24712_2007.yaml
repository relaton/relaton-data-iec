abstract:
- content: <p>ISO/IEC 24712:2007 defines colour test pages for the measurement of
    consumable yield. The test page suite includes four "customer" type documents
    and one "diagnostic" page that is used to determine end of ink or toner consumable
    life. These pages can be used for electro-photographic, inkjet printers and multi-function
    devices that have a digital printing path, i.e. an all-in-one electro-photographic
    machine that has digital printing capabilities.</p><p>ISO/IEC 24712:2007 provides
    a set of test pages in a common file format that would be used in the testing
    of consumable yield. The procedure for using these pages is detailed in ISO/IEC
    19798 and ISO/IEC 24711.</p><p>These pages are intended to represent some of the
    document types that are used in the office and home. They are not intended to
    represent special applications such as photo printing.</p>
