abstract:
- content: "<p>This document identifies a collection of user accessibility needs that
    diverse users have of ICT systems to make these systems accessible to them. Each
    user accessibility need might be required of a system by an individual. Different
    users can have different sets of user accessibility needs in different contexts.</p><p>While
    this set of user accessibility needs was developed for the domain of ICT, many
    of the user accessibility needs in this set also apply in other domains.</p><p>This
    document does not provide requirements or specific processes and methods for the
    application and evaluation of user accessibility needs. However, it could inform
    the development of such requirements (see 5.4).</p><p>This document is not designed
    for certification purposes or regulatory or contractual use.</p><p>The user accessibility
    needs in this document are intended to inform and encourage those responsible
    for accessibility to go beyond the minimum provisions of accessibility legislation
    and regulations.</p>"
