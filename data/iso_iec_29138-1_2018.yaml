abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nISO/IEC
    29138-1:2018 This document identifies a collection of user accessibility needs
    that diverse users have of ICT systems to make these systems accessible to them.
    Each user accessibility need might be required of a system by an individual. Different
    users can have different sets of user accessibility needs in different contexts.<br
    />\r\nWhile this set of user accessibility needs was developed for the domain
    of ICT, many of the user accessibility needs in this set also apply in other domains.<br
    />\r\nThis document does not provide requirements or specific processes and methods
    for the application and evaluation of user accessibility needs. However, it could
    inform the development of such requirements (see 5.4).<br />\r\nThis document
    is not designed for certification purposes or regulatory or contractual use.<br
    />\r\nThe user accessibility needs in this document are intended to inform and
    encourage those responsible for accessibility to go beyond the minimum provisions
    of accessibility legislation and regulations."
