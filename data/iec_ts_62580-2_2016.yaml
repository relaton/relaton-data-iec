abstract:
- content: IEC TS 62580-2:2016(E) specifies the on-board video surveillance&#x2F;CCTV
    system functionality and requirement for the purpose of interoperability between
    components of on-board video surveillance&#x2F;CCTV systems in the same vehicle
    and subsystems in different vehicles of the same train, which means two levels
    of interoperability are considered, one is interoperability between components
    and another is between subsystems.
