abstract:
- content: "<p>This International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and
    optical characteristics of a 120 mm optical disk to enable</p><p>interchange of
    such disks. It specifies the quality of the recorded signals, the format of the
    data and the recording method,</p><p>thereby allowing for information interchange
    by means of such disks. The data can be written, read and overwritten many</p><p>times
    using the phase change method. This disk is identified as DVD-RAM.</p><p>This
    International Standard specifies</p><p>- two related but different Types of this
    disk (see clause 7),</p><p>- the conditions for conformance,</p><p>- the environments
    in which the disk is to be tested, operated and stored,</p><p>- the mechanical,
    physical and dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical
    interchange between data</p><p>processing systems,</p><p>- the format of the information
    on the disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the
    error correcting</p><p>codes and the coding method,</p><p>- the characteristics
    of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to
    read the data from the disk.</p><p>This International Standard provides for the
    interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard for</p><p>volume
    and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data processing
    systems. The optical disks specified by</p><p>this International Standard may
    be enclosed in cases according to ISO/IEC 16825 as specified therein.</p>"
