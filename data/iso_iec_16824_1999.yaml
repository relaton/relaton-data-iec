abstract:
- content: "The electronic version of this International Standard can be downloaded
    from the ISO/IEC Information Technology Task Force (ITTF) web site.<br /><br />\r\nThis
    International Standard specifies the mechanical, physical and optical characteristics
    of a 120 mm optical disk to enable interchange of such disks. It specifies the
    quality of the recorded signals, the format of the data and the recording method,<br
    />\r\nthereby allowing for information interchange by means of such disks. The
    data can be written, read and overwritten many times using the phase change method.
    This disk is identified as DVD-RAM.<br />\r\nThis International Standard specifies<br
    />\r\n- two related but different Types of this disk (see clause 7),<br />\r\n-
    the conditions for conformance,<br />\r\n- the environments in which the disk
    is to be tested, operated and stored,<br />\r\n- the mechanical, physical and
    dimensional characteristics of the disk, so as to provide mechanical interchange
    between data processing systems,<br />\r\n- the format of the information on the
    disk, including the physical disposition of the tracks and sectors, the error
    correcting<br />\r\ncodes and the coding method,<br />\r\n- the characteristics
    of the signals recorded on the disk, thus enabling data processing systems to
    read the data from the disk.<br />\r\nThis International Standard provides for
    the interchange of disks between optical disk drives. Together with a standard
    for volume and file structure, it provides for full data interchange between data
    processing systems. The optical disks specified by this International Standard
    may be enclosed in cases according to ISO/IEC 16825 as specified therein."
