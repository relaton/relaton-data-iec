abstract:
- content: '<p class="MsoBodyText">This document surveys and summarizes the existing
    hardware monitoring methods, including research efforts and industrial applications.
    The explored monitoring technologies are classified by applied area, carrier type,
    target entity, objective pattern, and method of deployment. Moreover, this document
    summarizes the possible ways of utilizing monitoring technologies for hardware
    security assessment with some existing state-of-the-art security assessment approaches.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">The hardware mentioned in this document refers only to the
    core processing hardware, such as the central processing unit (CPU), microcontroller
    unit (MCU), and system on a chip (SoC), in the von Neumann system and does not
    include single-input or single-output devices such as memory or displays.</p><p
    class="MsoBodyText">The hardware monitoring technology discussed in this document
    has the following considerations and restrictions:</p><p class="ListContinue1"
    style="mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->the
    monitored target is for the post-silicon phase, not for the design-house phase
    (e.g. an RTL or netlist design);</p><p class="ListContinue1" style="mso-list:
    l0 level1 lfo1;"><!-- [if!supportLists]-->—<!--[endif]-->monitoring is only applied
    to the runtime system.</p>'
