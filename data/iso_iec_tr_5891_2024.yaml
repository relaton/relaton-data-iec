abstract:
- content: "ISO/IEC TR 5891:2024 This document surveys and summarizes the existing
    hardware monitoring methods, including research efforts and industrial applications.
    The explored monitoring technologies are classified by applied area, carrier type,
    target entity, objective pattern, and method of deployment. Moreover, this document
    summarizes the possible ways of utilizing monitoring technologies for hardware
    security assessment with some existing state-of-the-art security assessment approaches.<br
    />\r\nThe hardware mentioned in this document refers only to the core processing
    hardware, such as the central processing unit (CPU), microcontroller unit (MCU),
    and system on a chip (SoC), in the von Neumann system and does not include single-input
    or single-output devices such as memory or displays.<br />\r\nThe hardware monitoring
    technology discussed in this document has the following considerations and restrictions:<br
    />\r\n- the monitored target is for the post-silicon phase, not for the design-house
    phase (e.g. an RTL or netlist design);<br />\r\n- monitoring is only applied to
    the runtime system."
