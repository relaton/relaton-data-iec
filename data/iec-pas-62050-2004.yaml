    The Board Level Drop Test Method is intended to evaluate and compare drop performance of surface mount electronic components for handheld electronic product applications in an accelerated test environment, where excessive flexure of a circuit board causes product failure. The purpose is to standardize the test board and test methodology to provide a reproducible assessment of the drop test performance of surface mounted components while duplicating the failure modes normally observed during product level test.
    The purpose of this document is to prescribe a standardized test method and reporting procedure.
