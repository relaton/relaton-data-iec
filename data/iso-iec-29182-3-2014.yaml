  content: ISO&#x2F;IEC 29182-3:2014 provides Sensor Network Reference Architecture
    (SNRA) views. The architecture views include business, operational, systems, and
    technical perspectives, and these views are presented in functional, logical,
    and&#x2F;or physical views where applicable. ISO&#x2F;IEC 29182-3:2014 focuses
    on high-level architecture views which can be further developed by system developers
    and implementers for specific applications and services.
