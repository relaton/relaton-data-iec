  content: 'IEC/PAS 61076-3-119:2013(E) establishes specifications and test requirements
    for a connector with ten contacts, for use in industrial environments. This PAS
    specifies free and fixed connector inserts, with round contacts, suitable for
    screw or crimp terminations. Other terminations techniques, as solder or printed
    board connections are upon agreement between manufacturer and user. The free and
    fixed connectors have a push-pull locking mechanism for IP65 and IP67 protection
    according to IEC 60529. Connectors according this PAS are without breaking capacity
    COC according to IEC 61984, therefore they are not intended to be engaged or disengaged
    in normal use when live or under load, if not otherwise specified by the manufacturer.
