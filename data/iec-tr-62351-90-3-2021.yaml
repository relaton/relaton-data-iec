  content: "IEC TR 62351-90-3:2021, which is a technical report, provides guidelines
    for efficiently handling both IT and OT data in terms of their monitoring, classification
    and correlations on them to deduce any possible useful outcomes about the state
    of the power system.<br />\r\nThe convergence of information technologies (IT)
    and operational technologies (OT) refers to the integration of the systems, processes
    and data associated with the domains of IT and OT. This document provides guidelines
    for a comprehensive security monitoring for power grid components based on IT/OT
    convergent systems. The emphasis is about the development of a methodology and
    a set of recommendations for utility operators to build a general monitoring framework
    based on the analysis of the data collected from different IT and OT systems through
    network management, traffic inspection, and system activity readings. As such,
    the monitoring framework that this document introduces relies on the integration
    of management and logging information obtained using IEC 62351-7 and IEC 62351-14,
    respectively. Further systems and data sources from IT and OT would be considered
    such as the data obtained, for instance, through the IT network management using
    the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), the passive network monitoring,
    and the functional characterization of control and automation processes.<br />\r\nThis
    document's recommendations include the implementation of data collection, filtering
    and correlation mechanisms. The development of data analytics algorithms is out
    of the scope of this document and would be left to utility operators and owners.
    Finally, applications of the general monitoring framework guidelines and recommendations
    are provided for different power grid environments, namely for IEC 61850 substations
    and for Distributed Energy Resources (DER) systems."
