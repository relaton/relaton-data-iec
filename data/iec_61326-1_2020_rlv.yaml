abstract:
- content: "IEC 61326-1:2020 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br /><br />\r\nIEC 61326:2020
    specifies requirements for immunity and emissions regarding electroÂ¬magnetic compatibility
    (EMC) for electrical equipment, operating from a supply or battery of less than
    1 000 V AC or 1 500 V DC or from the circuit being measured. Equipment intended
    for professional, industrial-process, industrial-manufacturing and educational
    use is covered by this part. It includes equipment and computing devices for<br
    />\r\n- measurement and test;<br />\r\n- control;<br />\r\n- LABORATORY use;<br
    />\r\n- accessories intended for use with the above (such as sample handling equipment),<br
    />\r\nintended to be used in industrial and non-industrial locations."
