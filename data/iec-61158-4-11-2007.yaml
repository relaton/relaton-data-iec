  content: It provides basic time-critical messaging communications between devices
    in an automation environment. This protocol provides communication opportunities
    to all participating data-link entities in a synchronously-starting cyclic manner,
    according to a pre-established schedule, and in a cyclic or acyclic asynchronous
    manner, as requested each cycle by each of those data-link entities. Thus this
    protocol can be characterized as one which provides cyclic and acyclic access
    asynchronously but with a synchronous restart of each cycle. It includes the following
    significant changes with respect to the previous edition deletion of the former
    Type 6 fieldbus, and the placeholder for a Type 5 fieldbus data-link layer, for
    lack of market relevance; addition of new types of fieldbuses; division of this
    part into multiple parts numbered.
