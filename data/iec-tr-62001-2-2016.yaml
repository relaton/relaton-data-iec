  content: "IEC TR 62001-2:2016(E), which is a Technical Report, provides guidance
    on the performance aspects and verification of performance of harmonic filters.
    The scope of this document covers AC side filtering for the frequency range of
    interest in terms of harmonic distortion and audible frequency disturbances. It
    excludes filters designed to be effective in the PLC and radio interference spectra.
    This document concerns the &quot;conventional&quot; AC filter technology and line-commutated
    high-voltage direct current (HVDC) converters. This first edition of IEC TR 62001-2,
    together with IEC TR 62001-1, IEC TR 62001-3 and IEC TR 62001-4, cancels and replaces
    IEC TR 62001 published in 2009. This edition constitutes a technical revision.
    This edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect
    to IEC TR 62001:</br>\r\na) expanded and supplemented Clause 19, and Annex B;</br>\r\nb)
    new Clause 3 on current-based interference criteria;</br>\r\nc) new annexes on
    induced noise calculation with Dubanton equations;</br>\r\nd) addition of a TIF
    requirement in a technical specification;</br>\r\ne) specification of IT limits
    dependent on network impedance and on the impact of AC network harmonic impedance;
    and</br>\r\nf) specification of voltage level on the filter design necessary to
    fulfil an IT criterion."
