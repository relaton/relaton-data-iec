abstract:
- content: "IEC 61097-3:2017 specifies the performance requirements, technical characteristics,
    operational requirements and methods of testing of shipborne DSC equipment for
    use with MF, MF/HF and VHF installations in the GMDSS, including those required
    by Chapter IV of the 1974 International Convention for Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS)
    as amended, and is associated with IEC 60945 (Shipborne radio equipment forming
    part of the global maritime distress and safety system and marine navigational
    equipment).<br />\r\nThis document incorporates applicable parts of the performance
    standards of IMO Resolutions A.803(19), A.804(19) and A.806(19) (DSC facilities
    for VHF, MF and MF/HF radio installations), IMO MSC/Circ.862 (describing the operation
    of the distress button), the provisions of the ITU Radio Regulations, the technical
    characteristics of DSC equipment and the operational procedures for its use contained
    in Recommendations ITU-R M.493, M.541, M.689, M.821 and M.1082, and takes into
    account the general requirements contained in IMO Resolution A.694(17).<br />\r\nThis
    edition includes the following significant technical changes with respect to the
    previous edition:<br />\r\na) changes in the operation of DSC which have been
    developed by IMO and ITU since the first edition was published;<br />\r\nb) compliance
    with bridge alert management (BAM);<br />\r\nc) optional addition of remote operation
    of the DSC functionality. This facility can also used for type approval testing
    of the performance of the DSC equipment;<br />\r\nd) incorporation of the radio
    frequency test methods for MF, MF/HF and VHF transceivers and watch receivers
    for convenience of testing."
