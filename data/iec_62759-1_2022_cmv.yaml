abstract:
- content: "IEC 62759-1:2022 CMV contains both the official standard and its commented
    version. The commented version provides you with a quick and easy way to compare
    all the changes between IEC 62759-1:2022 edition 2.0 and the previous IEC 62759-1:2015
    edition 1.0. Furthermore, comments from IEC TC 82 experts are provided to explain
    the reasons of the most relevant changes, or to clarify any part of the content.<br
    /><br />\r\nIEC 62759-1:2022 describes methods for the simulation of transportation
    of complete package units of modules and combined subsequent environmental impacts.<br
    /><br />\r\nThis second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published
    in 2015. This edition includes the following significant technical changes with
    respect to the previous edition:\r\na. Cancellation of tests and references to
    relevant standards for CPV.\r\n\r\nb. Deletion of different classes for PV modules.\r\n\r\nc.
    Deletion of requirement for minimum 10 modules per shipping unit.\r\n\r\nd. Implementation
    of stabilization as intermediate measurement.\r\n\r\ne. Addition of pass/fail
    criteria.\r\n\r\nf. Change of requirements for retesting.\r\n\r\ng. Change of
    number of cycles in dynamic mechanical load test."
