    segments in codestream, and referring method of internal data in a JPEG 2000 image.</p><p>It
    specifies</p><p>- JPXML conversion rules for general box file formats,</p><p>-
    JPXML conversion rules for JPEG 2000 family file formats and codestream segments,
    and</p><p>- a complete referring location path to address to an exact box or codestream
    data in an image.</p><p>And it provides</p><p>- guidance on processes for converting
