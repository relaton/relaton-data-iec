  content: "<p>The principles are applicable to consumer products, services and a
    combination of both. They may usefully be followed by bodies and associations
    which conduct comparative testing programmes. The purpose of this Guide is to
    enable meaningful test results and information to be presented in a way which
    will help consumers and others to make an informed choice suitable to their own
    needs. The notes offer some but not all the means of applying the principles.</p>"
