  content: CORRECTED VERSION 2026-01<br /><br />An input&#x2F;output expansion bus
    with a 32- or 64-bit width is described in this standard. The SBus is designed
    for systems requiring a small number expansion ports. SBus Cards may be connected
    to a standard Sbus Connector mounted on the motherboard. SBus Devices may also
    be attached to the SBus directly on the system&#x27;s motherboard. The dimensions
    of the SBus Card are 83,8 mm by 146,7 mm, making the cards appropriate for small
    computer systems that make extensive use of highly integrated circuits. The SBus
    Cards are designed to be installed in a plane parallel to the system&#x27;s motherboard
    as mezzanine cards. They are designed to provide connections for devices external
    to the computer system through an exposed back panel. The form factor is useful
    in Futurebus+, VMEbus, desktop computers, and similar applications. The SBus has
    the capability of transferring data at rates up to 168 Mbytes&#x2F;s, depending
    on the implementation options selected. SBus Cards may either serve as Masters
    on the bus, providing all virtual address information as well as the data to be
    transferred, or they may serve as Slaves on the bus, providing data transfer according
    to the requirements of some other SBus Master. The SBus Master for a data transfer
    is selected by an arbitration process managed by the single SBus Controller on
    the SBus. The SBus Controller provides a virtual to physical address translation
    service.
