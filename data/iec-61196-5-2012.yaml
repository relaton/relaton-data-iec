    IEC 61196-5:2012(E) applies to coaxial communications cables. It specifies the requirements for trunk and distribution cables for use in cabled television distribution networks operating at temperatures between -40 °C and +65 °C and in the frequency range of 5 MHz to 1 002 MHz. This second edition cancels and replaces the first edition published in 2007. It constitutes a technical revision.
