  content: "IEC 60317-27-1:2020+AMD1:2024 CSV specifies the requirements of paper
    tape covered round copper winding wires. This covering consists of two or more
    layers of paper tape and is primarily intended for winding coils for oil immersed
    transformers. The range of nominal conductor diameters covered by this document
    is:<br />\r\n– 0,500 mm up to and including 5,000 mm.<br />\r\nThe nominal conductor
    diameters are specified in Clause 4 of IEC 60317-0-1:2013.<br />\r\nThe paper
    tapes included in this document are restricted to those specified in IEC 60554-1
    and IEC 60554-3-5."
