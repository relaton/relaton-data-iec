  content: IEC TR 62987:2015(E) provides guidance on nuclear-specific issues when
    applying failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and related methods to instrumentation
    and control systems important to safety in nuclear power plants. The information
    in this Technical Report complements, for nuclear power plant applications, the
    procedure for FMEA in IEC 60812.
