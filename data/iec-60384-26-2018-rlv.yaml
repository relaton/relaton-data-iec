  content: "IEC 60384-26:2018 RLV contains both the official IEC International Standard
    and its Redline version. The Redline version is available in English only and
    provides you with a quick and easy way to compare all the changes between the
    official IEC Standard and its previous edition.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIEC 60384-26:2018
    applies to fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid
    electrolyte primarily intended for d.c. applications for use in electronic equipment.
    Fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with solid (MnO2) electrolyte are covered
    by IEC 60384-4. Fixed aluminium electrolytic surface mount capacitors with conductive
    polymer solid electrolyte are covered by IEC 60384-25. The object of this document
    is to prescribe preferred ratings and characteristics and to select from IEC 60384-1,
    the appropriate quality assessment procedures, tests and measuring methods and
    to give general performance requirements for this type of capacitor. Test severities
    and requirements prescribed in detail specifications referring to this sectional
    specification shall be of equal or higher performance level, because lower performance
    levels are not permitted. This edition includes the following significant technical
    changes with respect to the previous edition:<br />\r\n- revision of the structure
    in accordance with ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2:2016 to the extent practicable,
    and harmonization between other similar kinds of documents;<br />\r\n- in addition,
    Clause 4 and all the tables have been reviewed in order to prevent duplications
    and contradictions.<br />\r\nThe contents of the corrigendum of April 2020 have
    been included in this copy."
