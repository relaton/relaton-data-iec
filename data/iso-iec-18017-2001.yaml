    <p>This International Standard defines the mapping functions in exchanges of private integrated services networks (PISN)</p>
    <p>required for their attachment to Virtual Private Network (VPN) functionality of public (or third party provided) network</p>
    <p>equipment.</p>
    <p>Mapping functions are required to provide for the physical termination of the interface at the C or T reference points, and for</p>
    <p>the mapping of user channels and signalling information flows at the Q reference point to the appropriate channels or timeslots</p>
    <p>at the C or T reference point.</p>
    <p>At the T reference, point it is assumed that the protocol used on the D channel is the enhanced version of DSS1. These protocol</p>
    <p>enhancements are given in Annex Q and Annex X of Recommendations Q.931 and Q.932 respectively.</p>
    <p>The mapping function specified in this International Standard are applicable to PINXs connected to a VPN that supports either</p>
    <p>PISN information flows between accesses and/or PISN services.</p>
    <p>The C and Q reference points are defined in ISO/IEC 11579-1. The T reference point is defined in ITU-T</p>
    <p>Rec. I.411.</p>
    <p>The types of interfaces at the C or T reference point covered by this International Standard are the ISDN primary rate interface</p>
    <p>and the basic access interface.</p>
