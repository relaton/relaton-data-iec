abstract:
- content: "IEC TS 62607-2-6:2024 which is a technical specification, specifies a
    protocol for determining the key control characteristic<br />\r\n- thermal diffusivity<br
    />\r\nfor vertically-aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) films grown on solid substrates
    by<br />\r\n- flash method.<br />\r\nA light pulse from a flash lamp or a laser
    is irradiated onto the front surface (substrate side) of the VACNT film on solid
    substrates. Then, the temperature change of the other side of the specimen is
    monitored in real time after the pulse irradiation. The thermal diffusivity of
    the VACNT film can be analysed from the time variation of this temperature change.<br
    />\r\n- This method is applicable for evaluating the thermal transport properties
    of the VACNT films that can be used as thermal interface materials in electronics
    assembly."
