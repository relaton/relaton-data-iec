  content: IEC TS 62600-103:2018(E) is concerned with the sub-prototype scale development
    of wave energy converters. It includes the wave tank test programmes, where wave
    conditions are controlled so they can be scheduled, and the first large-scale
    sea trials, where sea states occur naturally and the programmes are adjusted and
    flexible to accommodate the conditions. This document describes the minimum test
    programmes that form the basis of a structured technology development schedule.
    For each testing campaign, the prerequisites, goals and minimum test plans are
    specified.
