abstract:
- content: IEC 62899-202-8:2024 provides a method for measuring the resistance difference
    of the printing direction of a printed conductive layer with wire-shaped or wire-type
    conducting materials. The method described in this document offers a measurement
    method and conditions for solution processed conductive films, fabricated by coating
    and printing process.
