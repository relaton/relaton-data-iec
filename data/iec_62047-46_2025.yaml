abstract:
- content: "IEC 62047-46:2025 specifies the requirements and testing method to measure
    the tensile strength of membrane with nanoscale thickness (length from 100 μm
    to 5 000 μm, width from 100 μm to 1 000 μm, thickness from 50 nm to 500 nm) which
    is fabricated by micromachining technology used in silicon-based micro-electromechanical
    system (MEMS).<br />\r\nThis document is applicable to in-situ tensile strength
    measurement of nanoscale thickness membrane manufactured by microelectronics technology
    and related micromachining technology.<br />\r\nWith the devices scaling, the
    tensile strength degradation, induced by defects and contaminations, becomes severer.
    This document specifies an in-situ testing method of the tensile strength of membrane
    with nanoscale thickness based on a MEMS technique. This document does not need
    intricate instruments (such as scanning probe microscopy and nanoindenter) and
    special test specimens.<br />\r\nSince in-situ on-chip tester in this document
    and device are fabricated with the same process on the same wafer, this document
    can give some practical reference for the design part."
